These operations are often accomplished by the units that extracted the resource and/or others located nearby.\\n\\nMining activities are classified into divisions, groups and classes on the basis of the principal mineral produced. Divisions 05, 06 are concerned with mining and quarrying of fossil fuels (coal, lignite, petroleum, gas); divisions 07, 08 concern metal ores, various minerals and quarry products. \\n\\nSome of the technical operations of this section, particularly related to the extraction of hydrocarbons, may also be carried out for third parties by specialised units as an industrial service which is reflected in division 09.",

         "This section includes the physical or chemical transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products, although this cannot be used as the single universal criterion for defining manufacturing (see remark on processing of waste below). The materials, substances, or components transformed are raw materials that are products of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining or quarrying as well as products of other manufacturing activities. Substantial alteration, renovation or reconstruction of goods is generally considered to be manufacturing.\\n\\nThe output of a manufacturing process may be finished in the sense that it is ready for utilisation or consumption, or it may be semi-finished in the sense that it is to become an input for further manufacturing. For example, the output of alumina refining is the input used in the primary production of aluminium; primary aluminium is the input to aluminium wire drawing; and aluminium wire is the input for the manufacture of fabricated wire products.\\n\\nManufacture of specialised components and parts of, and accessories and attachments to, machinery and equipment is, as a general rule, classified in the same class as the manufacture of the machinery and equipment for which the parts and accessories are intended. Manufacture of unspecialised components and parts of machinery and equipment, e.g. engines, pistons, electric motors, electrical assemblies, valves, gears, roller bearings, is classified in the appropriate class of manufacturing, without regard to the machinery and equipment in which these items may be included. However, making specialised components and accessories by moulding or extruding plastics materials is included in group 22.2.\\n\\nAssembly of the component parts of manufactured products is considered manufacturing. This includes the assembly of manufactured products from either self-produced or purchased components. \\n\\nThe recovery of waste, i.e. the processing of waste into secondary raw materials is classified in group 38.3 (Materials recovery). While this may involve physical or chemical transformations, this is not considered to be a part of manufacturing. The primary purpose of these activities is considered to be the treatment or processing of waste and they are therefore classified in Section E (Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities). However, the manufacture of new final products (as opposed to secondary raw materials) is classified in manufacturing, even if these processes use waste as an input. For example, the production of silver from film waste is considered to be a manufacturing process.\\n\\nSpecialised maintenance and repair of industrial, commercial and similar machinery and equipment is, in general, classified in division 33 (Repair, maintenance and installation of machinery and equipment). However, the repair of computers and personal and household goods is classified in division 95 (Repair of computers and personal and household goods), while the repair of motor vehicles is classified in division 45 (Wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles). \\n\\nThe installation of machinery and equipment, when carried out as a specialised activity, is classified in 33.20. \\n\\nRemark: The boundaries of manufacturing and the other sectors of the classification system can be somewhat blurry. As a general rule, the activities in the manufacturing section involve the transformation of materials into new products. Their output is a new product. However, the definition of what constitutes a new product can be somewhat subjective. As clarification, the following activities are considered manufacturing in NACE:\\n- fresh fish processing (oyster shucking, fish filleting), not done on a fishing boat (see 10.20)\\n- milk pasteurising and bottling (see 10.51)\\n- leather converting (see 15.11)\\n- wood preserving (see 16.10)\\n- printing and related activities (see 18.1)\\n- tyre retreading (see 22.11)\\n- ready-mixed concrete production (see 23.63)\\n- electroplating, plating, and metal heat treating (see 25.61)\\n- rebuilding or remanufacture of machinery (e.g. automobile engines, see 29.10)\\n\\nConversely, there are activities that, although sometimes involving transformation processes, are classified in other sections of NACE; in other words, they are not classified as manufacturing. They include:\\n- logging, classified in section A (Agriculture, forestry and fishing);\\n- beneficiating of agricultural products, classified in section A (Agriculture, forestry and fishing); \\n- preparation of food for immediate consumption on the premises is classified to division 56 (Food and beverage service activities);\\n- beneficiating of ores and other minerals, classified in section B (Mining and quarrying); \\n- construction of structures and fabricating operations performed at the site of construction, classified in section F (Construction);\\n- activities of breaking bulk and redistribution in smaller lots, including packaging, repackaging, or bottling products, such as liquors or chemicals; sorting of scrap; mixing paints to customer order; and cutting metals to customer order; treatment not resulting into a different good is classified to section G (Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles).",

We were \\nable to assert ourselves strongly in this environment. \\nThis is also reflected in our balance sheet. We also  \\ncontinued to make progress in the implementation of \\nour strategy. \\nOur company has shown that we can achieve solid \\nfinancial results even under difficult conditions. In 2023 \\nsales of all-electric cars of the Mercedes-Benz brand \\nincreased by 73%. The proportion of electrified vehicles \\nin total car sales was 20%. Mercedes-Benz Group AG \\nhas also initiated important projects to expand the \\ncharging infrastructure in our core markets. The direct \\nsales model was rolled out in additional markets. Fol -\\nlowing the introduction of our conditionally automated \\ndriver assistance system in the United States, we also \\nreceived approval to test the technology for motorway \\nuse in Beijing. Moreover, we were able to achieve \\nanother significant part of our targeted reduction in \\nfixed costs. These successful developments are also reflected in our \\nannual results. Our revenue amounted to €153 billion. \\nHowever, EBIT fell by 4% to €19.7 billion. Our net  \\nliquidity in the industrial business was €31.7 billion.  \\nThe bottom line was a net profit of €14.5 billion.  \\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board \\nwill recommend a dividend of €5.30 per share to the \\nAnnual General Meeting. \\nThese figures are the result of the exceptional commit -\\nment of our employees. Without their dedication and \\nability the successes of the year 2023 would not have \\nbeen possible. The thanks of the entire Board of Man-\\nagement goes to all of our colleagues. \\nLooking ahead, what topics are on our agenda? \\nWe want to take our customers’ brand experience to \\nthe next level. To this end, we are redesigning our \\nshowrooms all over the world.

That’s why we are building our own \\nfast-charging network. We want to install more than \\n10,000 charging points in our core markets by the end \\nof the decade. The aim of all these measures is to fulfil \\nour brand promise at all points of contact with our  \\ncustomers and create special Mercedes moments. \\nIn our view, our most important task is to build the \\nworld’s most desirable vehicles. The focus is on the \\nupper end of the segments in which we are represented. \\nThat’s why we are taking targeted steps to strengthen \\nour portfolio in 2024. The première of our electric \\nG-Class will be a highlight. We are also launching the \\nMaybach version of the EQS SUV in key markets. At \\nAMG, we are presenting further variants of our new top-\\nof-the-line AMG GT model. And at Mercedes-Benz, we \\nare further enhancing the substance of our electric cars \\nin the luxury segment in areas ranging from efficiency \\nand comfort to design.\\nThe pace of the transformation to electric mobility is \\ndetermined by market conditions and our customers’ \\nrequirements. We will be prepared for every kind of \\nmarket scenario. The motto for the production of our \\nvehicles with combustion engines is “tactical flexibility”. \\nWhen it comes to electric mobility, our strategic course \\nis to create the preconditions for becoming all-electric.We have laid the foundations for this course. The devel -\\nopment of multiple new vehicle platforms is in full \\nswing. This will take our electric cars and vans to the \\nnext level. We will start in the entry-level segment in \\n2025 with the new electric CLA. This will set new stand-\\nards in terms of range, efficiency and charging speed.  \\nAt the same time, our own operating system MB.OS will \\ncelebrate its première. Thus we will also reach an \\nimportant milestone in terms of software. Our custom-\\ners can now look forward to an even more natural, more \\npersonal and more extensive interaction with their \\nMercedes-Benz.  \\nIn 2023 we made our company even more resilient and \\nachieved significant strategic progress. In addition,  \\nwe can build on an outstanding brand and a powerful \\nteam.

In doing so, the company focuses on innovative \\nand forward-looking technologies and safe high-quality \\nvehicles that fascinate and excite. \\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group comprises the automotive \\nbusiness units Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz \\nVans as well as Mercedes-Benz Mobility. Each business \\nunit pursues a strategy that is specifically targeted at \\nthe market and customers it serves. The strategy in \\nquestion is based on the principles of sustainability, \\nintegrity and diversity and is supported by a highly qual -\\nified and motivated team.\\nSustainability, integrity and diversity are the basis \\nof our conduct at the Mercedes-Benz Group\\nSustainability at the Mercedes-Benz Group means  \\ncreating permanent value for all of our stakeholders — \\nfor our customers, investors and employees and for our \\nbusiness partners and society as a whole. In this pro-\\ncess, economic, environmental and social responsibility \\nbelong together — along the entire value chain. In order \\nto live up to this responsibility, the Mercedes-Benz \\n1 Net carbon-neutral means that no CO 2 emissions are caused or that any CO 2 emissions\\n arising are compensated for by certified offset projects.Group utilizes a holistic ESG (environmental, social and \\ngovernance) concept throughout all of its divisions. \\nOne of the company’s goals here is to reduce CO 2 emis -\\nsions per passenger car over the entire vehicle life cycle \\nby the end of this decade by up to 50% as compared to \\n2020 levels. In addition to the comprehensive use of \\nrecycling materials and renewable energy in production, \\nthe integration of renewable energy sources for charg -\\ning the vehicles and electrification of the vehicle fleet is \\nan important tool for accomplishing this. This is why the \\nMercedes-Benz Group is taking the necessary steps to \\ngo all electric.

In addi-\\ntion, the company’s factories are retooled to follow \\ndemand and can capture the tipping point into an \\nall-electric era. The Mercedes-Benz Group expects its \\nhigh power charging network to ease the ramp-up of \\nelectromobility. The Group will expand battery produc -\\ntion and open a battery recycling factory to close the \\nloop. The Mercedes-Benz Group’s ambition is to make \\nthe entire new vehicle fleet net carbon-neutral1 across \\nall stages of the value chain by 2039. This holistic ESG approach is accompanied by social \\nand governance aspects such as the transformation of \\nthe workplace and upholding human rights. \\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group is convinced that long-term \\nsuccess can only be achieved by acting in an ethically \\nand legally responsible manner. Integrity is therefore \\nvery important to the company. For the Mercedes-Benz \\nGroup, ethical behaviour means doing what is right, \\ncomplying with external and internal rules, following our \\nmoral compass and aligning our activities with shared \\nvalues.\\nDiversity is the third foundation of our conduct at the \\nMercedes-Benz Group. The Group is convinced that \\nsustained success can only be achieved with diverse \\nteams. Through the use of appropriate measures and \\nactivities, the Mercedes-Benz Group seeks to foster a \\nwork environment that offers equal opportunities to all \\nemployees.'),\n",

The ‚elec -\\ntric-first‘ platform MMA which will be launched next \\nyear, marks the next step into the electric future of \\nMercedes-Benz Cars. The platforms MB.EA and AMG.EA \\nwill follow. Thus, Mercedes-Benz Cars will offer our  \\ncustomers an all-electric alternative for each model. \\nMercedes-Benz Cars’ expertise in the field of electric \\nmobility is to be extended, and the vertical integration \\nwill also be increased by insourcing drive-system tech-\\nnologies for electric vehicles. To ensure efficient pro-\\nduction and promote the future development of battery \\ncells and modules, the division plans to work together \\nwith partners to build various battery cell production \\nplants worldwide.

EBIT that is calculated at the Group level \\ntakes into account centrally managed matters and elim-\\ninations.\\nIn order to provide a more transparent presentation of \\nour ongoing business, adjusted EBIT is also calculated \\nand reported for both the Group and the divisions. The \\nadjustments include individual items insofar as they \\nlead to material effects in a reporting year. These indi-\\nvidual items can relate in particular to legal proceedings \\nand related measures, restructuring measures and M&A \\ntransactions. \\nGroup EBIT minus the centrally managed income taxes \\nequals net operating profit. The chapter Profitability \\nshows how net operating profit is calculated. \\nReturn on sales\\nAs one of the main factors influencing value added, \\nreturn on sales is of particular importance for assessing \\nthe profitability of the automotive divisions. Return on \\nsales is the ratio of EBIT to revenue, and vehicle sales \\nare the primary source of revenue. The measure of prof -\\nitability for Mercedes-Benz Mobility is not return on \\nsales but return on equity (the ratio of EBIT to average \\nequity on a quarterly basis). On the basis of adjusted \\nEBIT, an adjusted return on sales is reported for the automotive divisions and an adjusted return on equity \\nis reported for Mercedes-Benz Mobility.\\nNet assets\\nAll assets, liabilities and provisions for which the auto-\\nmotive divisions are responsible in day-to-day opera-\\ntions are allocated to them. Performance measurement \\nat Mercedes-Benz Mobility is implemented on an equity \\nbasis. Net assets at the Group level include the net \\noperating assets of the automotive divisions and the \\nequity of Mercedes-Benz Mobility, as well as assets and \\nliabilities from income taxes and other reconciling items \\nwhich are not allocated to the divisions. The average \\nannual net assets are calculated on the basis of the \\naverage quarterly net assets. \\nCash flow\\nA change in net assets — for example as a result of \\ninvestments — generally leads to the application or \\nrelease of liquid funds. Along with earnings, net assets \\nthus also have a direct effect on the cash flow. Of out -\\nstanding importance for the financial strength of the \\nMercedes-Benz Group is the free cash flow of the \\nindustrial business, which comprises the cash flows at \\nthe automotive divisions and the cash flows from inter -\\nest, taxes and other reconciling items that cannot be \\nallocated to the divisions. The operating cash flow \\nbefore interest and taxes (CFBIT) for the automotive \\ndivisions is derived from EBIT and the change in net \\nassets. The cash conversion rate (CCR) is the ratio of \\nCFBIT to EBIT over a period of time and is an important \\nmeasure for cash-flow management at the automotive \\ndivisions. In order to provide a more transparent presentation of \\nour ongoing business, the adjusted free cash flow of \\nthe industrial business and the adjusted CFBIT of the \\nautomotive divisions are also calculated and reported. \\nAn adjusted cash conversion rate (adjusted CCR) on the \\nbasis of adjusted CFBIT and adjusted EBIT is presented \\nfor the automotive divisions.

The adverse \\neffects on growth that resulted from the steep and syn-\\nchronized tightening of monetary policy by many cen-\\ntral banks was offset to some degree by supportive fis -\\ncal policies and lower prices for energy and raw \\nmaterials. At the same time, major differences were \\nobserved between regions, and even within regions in \\nsome cases. The main reason for the positive develop-\\nment of the world economy overall was the unexpected \\nresilience of the US economy in the face of an \\nextremely restrictive monetary policy, although major \\nemerging markets such as India and Brazil were also \\nable to exceed expectations in this regard. On the other hand, the European and the Chinese economies dis -\\nplayed relatively weak development during the year \\nunder review. Given these circumstances, global trade \\nvolume not only slowed but also contracted by around \\n2% in 2023 as compared to the previous year.\\nThe US economy successfully defied recession risks \\nduring the reporting year. Growth remained strong \\ndespite the fact that the country’s central bank — the \\nFed — raised its policy rate throughout the course of \\nthe year by a further 100 basis points to 5.5%. Private \\nconsumption in particular developed dynamically and \\nwas supported by generous fiscal programmes and \\npandemic-era excess savings. Inflation also continued \\nto decline — at an average of 4.1%, it was significantly \\nlower than in the prior year, but it still remained above \\nthe Fed’s target. This development, along with substan-\\ntial wage increases, had a positive effect on disposable \\nincome. Thanks to robust domestic demand, the US \\neconomy recorded growth of 2.5% for the year as a \\nwhole in 2023.\\nThe economy in the euro zone developed much less \\ndynamically, although the burden caused by high \\nenergy prices was noticeably less pronounced in 2023 than it was in the prior year. Still, the industrial sector \\nremained under extreme pressure and shrank signifi-\\ncantly over the year as a whole. Private consumption \\nstagnated across many sectors due to ongoing high, \\nalbeit decreasing, inflation and rising interest rates. \\nInflation in the euro zone averaged 5.4% for the year as \\na whole, which was still much higher than the central \\nbank target of approximately 2%. The European Central \\nBank thus continued its tight monetary policy, raising \\nthe main refinancing rate throughout the course of the \\nyear by a further 200 basis points to 4.5%. Economic \\nactivity in the euro zone advanced slightly during the \\nfirst half of the year, due, among other things, to the \\nongoing post-pandemic recovery and fewer supply \\nchain disruptions. However, output then declined mar -\\nginally during the second half of the year, with the \\nresult that the economy in the euro zone recorded \\ngrowth of only 0.5% for 2023 as a whole.\\nFollowing the end of the zero-COVID policy in China, \\nthe Chinese economy started the year with a strong \\nrecovery that it was unable to maintain. The recovery \\nwas ultimately curbed by the pronounced weakness of \\nthe Chinese real estate sector and the associated crisis \\nof confidence among consumers.

Year-on-year, the \\nvalue of the euro increased by around 6% against the \\nrenminbi.\\nEnergy and raw material prices\\nPrices for oil and gas declined significantly from their \\nrecord levels in 2022, but they remained very volatile \\nnevertheless. The oil price fell below USD 80 per barrel \\nat the end of the year, which was almost 9% lower than \\nat the end of 2022. The average price for the year as a \\nwhole was about 17% lower than in the previous year. \\nGas prices in Europe also fell noticeably. The price at \\nthe end of the year — approximately €32 — was almost \\n60% lower than the price at the end of 2022 but still \\nhigher than the price before the pandemic. Prices for \\nindustrial raw materials also tended to decrease further \\nover the year and at the end of the year were a little \\nless than 3% below the prices recorded at the end of \\n2022.Automotive markets \\n \\nThe economic conditions described above also affected \\nthe development of the global automotive market in the \\nyear under review. Nevertheless, sales markets were \\nable to partially buck the trend of the overall economic \\nslowdown. In particular, the normalization of global \\nvehicle production, as well as the order backlog that \\nstill existed in some cases in the aftermath of the pan-\\ndemic, boosted the development of sales last year. \\nCustomer demand, in contrast, weakened in many auto-\\nmotive markets throughout the year. \\nAgainst this background, the global car market volume \\noverall was significantly higher than in the previous \\nyear.

The US market for large vans also increased \\nsignificantly in volume compared to the previous year. \\nSales figures for mid-size vans in China were also signif -\\nicantly higher than in the previous year, although \\ngrowth in that market was largely a result of the intro-\\nduction of new vehicle models by relevant competitors.'),\n",

The total value of all \\nnew contracts was thus slightly higher than in the prior \\nyear (31 December 2022: €58.0 billion, +7%; +10% after \\nadjusting for exchange-rate effects). The main reason \\nfor the positive development was the higher average \\nfinancing and leasing volume per contract, driven by \\nimproved pricing on the sales side and a higher propor -\\ntion of electrified and Top-End vehicles in the new busi-\\nness.\\nIn the German market, new business was roughly on a \\npar with the previous year at €10.4 billion (+2%). Contract volume amounted to €24.5 billion (-3%). The \\nUS market benefited from a higher average financing \\nand leasing volume per contract and a significant \\nincrease in the penetration rate. The penetration rate \\nindicates the proportion of leased and financed vehi-\\ncles in the Group’s unit sales. At €16.2 billion (+25%), \\nthe volume of new business at the end of 2023 was \\nconsiderably higher than the figure recorded in the prior \\nyear. At €35.7 billion, contract volume at the end of \\nDecember 2023 was slightly higher than at the end of \\n2022 (+3%). In China, on the other hand, increased \\ncompetition in the financial services sector caused new \\nbusiness to decrease by 18% compared to the prior year \\nto €9.8 billion.

The cost of capital used in the calculation of value \\nadded is based on average net assets multiplied by the \\ncost of capital rate. The ratio of earnings to net assets \\nresults in the profitability of net assets, i.e. the return \\non capital employed (return on net assets, RONA). \\nThe measure of earnings for the segments is EBIT and \\nfor the Group is net operating profit, which in addition \\nto the EBIT of the segments also includes earnings \\neffects for which the segments are not accountable, \\nsuch as income taxes and other reconciling items.The following table shows value added for the \\nMercedes-Benz Group and for the individual segments. \\nValue added\\n2023 2022 23/22\\nIn millions of euros Change\\nMercedes -Benz Group 8,844 10,236 -1,392\\nMercedes-Benz Cars 8,841 11,757 -2,916\\nMercedes-Benz Vans 2,975 1,791 +1,184\\nMercedes-Benz Mobility -488 692 -1,180\\nThe value added of the Mercedes -Benz Group in the \\nreporting year amounted to €8.8 billion (2022: €10.2 bil -\\nlion), representing a return on net assets of 23.8% \\n(2022: 25.5%). This was once again significantly higher \\nthan the Group’s required cost of capital rate of 9% \\n(2022: 8%). The value added of the Mercedes-Benz \\nGroup decreased, mainly due to the negative develop-\\nment of EBIT of the segments Mercedes-Benz Cars and \\nMercedes-Benz Mobility. The €1.3 billion increase in \\naverage net assets also had a slightly negative effect  \\non value added. This was partly offset by the positive \\ndevelopment of EBIT at Mercedes-Benz Vans.At the Mercedes -Benz Cars segment, value added of \\n€8.8 billion was below the prior-year amount of \\n€11.8 billion. RONA amounted to 34.4% (2022: 42.8%). \\nThis was primarily due to the negative earnings devel -\\nopment. The segment’s average net assets, which at \\n€3.2 billion, were higher than in the previous year, \\nincreased the negative effect on the value added. This \\nwas mainly due to higher average inventories and \\ndecreasing average provisions for other risks.\\nThe value added of the Mercedes -Benz Vans segment \\nincreased significantly from €1.8 billion to €3.0 billion. \\nRONA amounted to 250.4% (2022: 214.4%). This was \\nmainly due to the very positive earnings development. \\nThe average net assets showed an opposing increase to \\n€1.3 billion, which was primarily due to increased aver -\\nage inventories and decreasing average provisions for \\nother risks.\\nAt the Mercedes -Benz Mobility segment, value added \\namounted to minus €0.5 billion (2022: €0.7 billion). The \\nsegment’s return on equity was 9.5% (2022: 16.8%). The \\ndevelopment of the return on equity primarily reflects \\nthe decrease in earnings.

Worldwide financial management is per -\\nformed within the framework of legal requirements con-\\nsistently for the Group entities by the Treasury depart -\\nment of the Mercedes-Benz Group. Financial \\nmanagement operates within a framework of guidelines, \\nlimits and benchmarks, and on the operational level is \\norganizationally separate from other financial functions \\nsuch as settlement, financial controlling, reporting and \\naccounting. \\nCapital structure management designs the capital \\nstructure of the Group and its subsidiaries. Decisions \\nregarding the capitalization of the Mercedes-Benz \\nGroup companies are based on the principles of \\ncost-optimized and risk-optimized liquidity and capital \\nresources. Liquidity management aims to ensure the Group can \\nmeet its payment obligations at any time. For this pur -\\npose, the Group records the cash flows from operating \\nand financial activities in a rolling plan. The resulting \\nfinancial requirements are covered by the use of appro-\\npriate instruments for liquidity management (e.g. bank \\ncredit, commercial paper and notes); liquidity surpluses \\nare invested in the money market or the capital market \\ntaking into account risk and return expectations. Our \\ngoal is to ensure the level of liquidity regarded as nec -\\nessary at optimal costs. Besides operational liquidity, \\nthe Mercedes-Benz Group maintains additional sources \\nof liquidity which are available in the short term. Those \\nadditional financial resources include a pool of receiva-\\nbles from the financial services business which are \\navailable for securitization in the capital market and a \\ncontractually confirmed syndicated credit facility. Since \\nDecember 2021, the Group also has liquidity reserves in \\nthe form of its shareholding in Daimler Truck Hold-\\ning AG, which can only be sold with the consent of \\nDaimler Truck Holding AG until the end of 2024. Con-\\nsent to the sale is not required in the event of a crisis or \\nafter December 2024.Cash management centrally determines the cash \\nrequirements and surpluses. By means of cash-pooling \\nprocedures, liquidity is in general centrally concen-\\ntrated on bank accounts of the Mercedes-Benz Group in \\nvarious currencies. Most of the payments between \\ncompanies of the Group are made through internal \\nclearing accounts so that the number of external cash \\nflows is reduced to a minimum. The Mercedes-Benz \\nGroup has established standardized processes and sys -\\ntems to manage its bank accounts and internal \\ncash-clearing accounts, and to execute automated pay -\\nment transactions. \\nManagement of market-price risks aims to limit the \\nimpact of fluctuations in foreign exchange-rates and \\ninterest rates on the earnings of the divisions and the \\nGroup. The Group’s overall exposure to these mar -\\nket-price risks is initially determined in order to provide \\na basis for hedging decisions. These include the volume \\nto be hedged, the period to be hedged and the choice \\nof hedging instruments. The hedging strategy is speci-\\nfied at Group level and uniformly implemented. The \\ndecision-making body is the Treasury Risk Management \\nCommittee, which meets regularly.'),\n",

The plan assets are legally sepa-\\nrated from the Group’s assets and are invested primarily \\nin funds; they are not available for general business \\npurposes. The plan assets are spread across a broad \\nrange of investment categories such as equities, \\nfixed-interest securities, alternative investments and \\nreal estate, depending on the expected development of \\npension obligations and with the help of risk-return \\noptimization. The performance of the asset manage-\\nment is measured by comparison with defined bench-\\nmark indices. The investment risks are limited via a \\nGroup-wide policy. In addition, there are local regula-\\ntions for risk management for the individual plan assets. \\nAdditional information on pension plans and similar \\nobligations is provided in Note 22 of the Notes to the \\nConsolidated Financial Statements. The risk volume that is subject to credit risk manage-\\nment includes the Mercedes-Benz Group’s worldwide \\ncreditor positions with financial institutions, issuers of \\nsecurities and customers in the financial services busi-\\nness, as well as trade receivables. Credit risks with \\nfinancial institutions and issuers of securities arise pri-\\nmarily from investments executed as part of our liquid-\\nity management and from the application of derivative \\nfinancial instruments. The management of these credit \\nrisks is mainly based on an internal limit system that \\nreflects the creditworthiness of the respective financial \\ninstitution or issuer. The credit risk with customers of \\nthe automotive business results from relationships with \\ncontracted dealerships and general agencies, other cor -\\nporate customers and retail customers. In connection \\nwith the export business, general agencies that accord-\\ning to the creditworthiness analyses are not sufficiently \\ncreditworthy are generally required to provide collater -\\nals such as first-class bank guarantees. The credit risk \\nwith end customers in the financial services business is \\nmanaged by Mercedes-Benz Mobility on the basis of a \\nstandardized risk-management process. In this process, \\nminimum requirements are defined for the sales-financ -\\ning and leasing business and standards are set for \\ncredit processes, as well as for the identification, meas -\\nurement and management of risks. Key elements for the \\nmanagement of credit risks are appropriate creditwor -\\nthiness assessments supported by statistical risk-clas -\\nsification methods, as well as structured portfolio anal -\\nysis and portfolio monitoring. Financial country risk management includes various \\naspects: the risk from investments in subsidiaries and \\njoint ventures, the risk from the cross-border financing \\nof Group companies in high-risk countries and the risk \\nfrom direct sales to customers in those countries. The \\nGroup has an internal rating system that assigns the \\ncountries in which it operates to risk categories. Risks \\nfrom cross-border receivables are partially protected \\nwith the use of letters of credit and bank guarantees in \\nfavour of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and other Group \\ncompanies. In addition, an internal committee sets and \\nrestricts the level of hard-currency credits granted to \\nMercedes-Benz Mobility companies in high-risk coun-\\ntries. \\nFurther information on the management of market-price \\nrisk, credit risk and liquidity risk is provided in Note 33 \\nof the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.'),\n",

On the other hand, effects in con-\\nnection with the recognition and measurement of right-\\nof-use assets, which result from lessee accounting and \\nare largely non-cash items, are included in the free cash \\nflow of the industrial business.

In addition, the calculation of the free cash \\nflow of the industrial business includes the cash flows \\nto be shown under cash flow from financing activities in \\nconnection with the acquisition or disposal of interests \\nin subsidiaries without loss of control.\\nIn 2023, the free cash flow of the industrial business \\namounted to €11.3\\xa0billion and was thus higher than the \\nprevious year’s figure of €8.1\\xa0billion.\\nThe increase in the free cash flow of the industrial busi-\\nness by €3.2\\xa0billion to €11.3\\xa0billion compared to the pre-\\nvious year is characterized by an improvement in profit \\nbefore income taxes of the industrial business. During \\nthe reporting period, a positive effect resulted from the \\ndevelopment of the working capital, mainly due to a \\nlower inventory build-up and a decrease in the trade \\nreceivables compared to the previous year. A smaller \\nincrease in trade payables compared to the previous \\nyear had an opposing effect.In the previous year, the free cash flow was also \\nimpacted by higher payments resulting from the settle-\\nment of civil and environmental claims made by several \\nUS authorities in 2020 in connection with emission \\ncontrol systems used in certain diesel vehicles as well \\nas higher payments in connection with restructuring \\nmeasures. Another positive effect resulted from a lower \\nincrease in the number of leased vehicles compared to \\nthe previous year. Moreover, higher dividend payments \\nwere received during the reporting period from equi-\\nty-method investments, in particular Daimler Truck \\nHolding AG and Beijing Benz Automotive Co., Ltd. \\nInvestments in and disposals of shareholdings and \\nother business operations resulted in slightly higher \\ncash inflows in the reporting period than in the previ-\\nous year.\\nThere was an increase in income taxes paid in compari-\\nson to the prior year, which resulted from the improve-\\nment in earnings before taxes in the industrial business. \\nIn addition to payments to the tax authorities, income \\ntax payments also include intra-Group payments and \\nrefunds based on contractual arrangements within the \\ntax groups.

The decrease in the free cash flow of the \\nMercedes-Benz Group was mainly due to the higher \\nleasing and sales-financing business of Mercedes-Benz \\nMobility compared to the previous year. This was offset \\nby a year-on-year increase in the free cash flow of the \\nindustrial business. \\nIn 2022, a cash inflow in the amount of €1.3 billion \\nwhich related to the payments received from the sale \\nof intercompany loans in connection with the sale of \\nunits of the truck financing business and does not \\nlegally relate to Mercedes-Benz Mobility, was economi-\\ncally allocated to the cash flow from investing activi-\\nties of Mercedes -Benz Mobility. An opposing repay -\\nment of the financing liabilities in the same amount \\nwas recognized in the cash flow from financing activi-\\nties of Mercedes-Benz Mobility.

(Further information w group.mercedes-benz.\\ncom/investors/share/esg) \\nSustainable investment\\nThe implementation of the Mercedes-Benz Group’s sus -\\ntainable business strategy requires massive amounts of \\ninvestment. For this reason, one of the Group’s goals is \\nto ensure that its securities are viewed even more \\nstrongly by the capital market as a sustainable invest -\\nment. To this end, the Mercedes-Benz Group maintains \\na continuous dialogue with players on the capital mar -\\nket as representatives of investors in equity and debt. \\nVarious platforms are used here. For example, the sec -\\nond digital ESG Conference was one of the formats \\nused by the Mercedes-Benz Group in the 2023 report -\\ning year to provide information to investors and analysts on the latest developments relating to its sus -\\ntainable business strategy.\\nWith regard to ESG communication, the Investor Rela-\\ntions & Treasury unit at Mercedes-Benz Group AG \\nworks closely together with the company’s in-house \\nsustainability departments and is also integrated into \\nthe relevant committees (e.g. the GSC). This is how  \\nthe company is responding to the fact that sustainable \\ninvestment has become a central investment strat -\\negy — in particular for institutional investors, who set \\nespecially high standards of transparency for external \\nreporting according to ESG criteria.\\nDuring the year under review, the Group updated its \\nGreen Finance Framework from 2020 in order to posi-\\ntion the Mercedes-Benz Group even more effectively as \\na company worthy of sustainable investment and to \\nenable it to utilize ESG-based capital for its business \\ndevelopment. This framework makes it possible for the \\nGroup to finance investment targeted at the develop-\\nment, production and customer financing of all-electric \\nvehicles through bonds and loans, for example.

ESG  \\ncriteria are also playing an increasingly important role \\nin this area.\\nFor German pension assets, the following objectives \\nhave been defined for the consideration of ESG criteria: \\ncreation of transparency in dealing with sustainability \\naspects, utilization of opportunities from sustainable \\ndevelopments and the appropriate consideration of \\nsustainability risks. For the majority of German pension \\nassets the investments are made by asset managers to \\nwhom the Group issues individual mandates.\\nIn coordination with the Investment Committees, the \\nMercedes-Benz Group pays, as part of its sustainability \\nconcept, increased attention to the consideration and \\ntransparency of sustainability aspects in the investment \\nprocess. When the company makes sustainable invest -\\nments, it also takes the associated risk and return \\naspects into account. For liquid asset classes, the Mercedes-Benz Group only works with investment man-\\nagers who have signed the UN Principles for Responsi-\\nble Investment (PRI). The use of a negative list is \\nintended to exclude investing in companies and coun-\\ntries that do not fulfil the Group’s core requirements. By \\nimplementing ESG-themed investments, the Mercedes-\\nBenz Group utilizes the opportunities offered by sus -\\ntainable developments. Furthermore, the Mercedes-\\nBenz Group focuses on gradually integrating \\nsustainability aspects — via benchmarks or sustainabil -\\nity performance indicators, for example — into its man-\\ndates. To this end, the Group included sustainability \\ntargets in some of its mandates with external asset \\nmanagers in 2023 and also firmly incorporated these \\ngoals and targets into its investment guidelines. Taking \\ninto account the available data coverage, the Group \\nwas thus able to achieve a lower carbon footprint for its \\nasset classes equities and corporate bonds of the  \\nGerman pension assets compared to the aggregated \\nbenchmark. Whereas the aggregated benchmark is \\ndetermined by the indices awarded to the asset manag -\\ners, the carbon footprint is calculated based on exter -\\nnally bought ESG data. In addition, the Mercedes-Benz \\nGroup also established an internal reporting system for \\nvarious sustainability metrics for its German pension \\nassets.\\nThe measures we have implemented as part of our sus -\\ntainability concept are regularly assessed and adapted \\nto current developments. Mercedes-Benz Pensions -\\nfonds AG takes into account adverse effects on sustain-\\nability factors within the framework of the Sustainable \\nFinance Disclosure Regulation. For investing foreign pension assets, country-specific requirements regard-\\ning consideration of ESG criteria apply.\\nTax obligation \\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group views itself as a responsible \\ncompany that endeavours to meet all of its global tax \\nobligations and use public funding responsibly. In this \\nway, the Group can also fulfil its social and ethical \\nresponsibilities.\\nThe Group’s tax strategy operates according to the  \\nfollowing principles in particular:\\n–  By qualified and experienced experts and, if possible, \\nefficient and reliable processes, systems, methods \\nand controls the Mercedes-Benz Group wants to \\nensure that the tax obligations by the Group compa-\\nnies are met and integrity standards are maintained.\\n–  In line with the principle of being a good corporate \\ntax citizen (i.e. fulfilling its responsibility as a tax -\\npayer), the Mercedes-Benz Group conducts legal, \\nproactive and non-aggressive tax planning activities \\non the basis of operational considerations (“tax  \\nfollows business”).

The Mercedes-Benz Group expects that \\nincreased unit sales of all-electric vehicles will lead to  \\na further reduction of CO 2 emissions in 2024.\\nDevelopment of CO 2 emissions in the United States\\nIn the United States, fleet values are regulated by two \\nseparate federal standards for limiting greenhouse \\ngases and fuel consumption in vehicle fleets: the \\nGreenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG) and the Corporate \\nAverage Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard. For the 2023 \\nmodel year, the GHG fleet figure is 170 g CO 2/mi for the \\ncar fleet and 259 g CO 2/mi for the light duty truck (LDT) \\nfleet (vans and SUVs - based on latest forecast). Due to \\nan increase in the share of the total fleet in the United \\nStates accounted for by electrified vehicles (xEV), the \\nMercedes-Benz Group came in below its average fleet \\ntarget of 179 g CO 2/mi for the car fleet. The target  \\nvalue of 233 g CO 2/mi for the light duty truck (LDT) fleet \\n(vans and SUVs) could not be reached.

The CO 2 targets in these classes depend on the \\npayload, the towing capacity and the drive type of the \\nvehicles. In the reporting year, the CO 2 emissions of \\nMercedes-Benz medium duty vehicles (MDV) were \\n436 g CO 2/mi, which is lower than the target value of \\n476 g CO 2/mi.

As a milestone, for example, contracts \\nwere signed with two steel suppliers from Europe and \\nAmerica in the year under review, which provide for \\ndeliveries of CO 2-reduced steel for current and future \\nmodel series. Progress on climate protection in the sup-\\nply chain is reported at regular intervals in the Group \\nSustainability Committee (GSC).\\nResource conservation  \\nin the supply chain\\nThe supply chain also plays an important role in efforts to \\nconserve resources. The Mercedes-Benz Group wants to \\ndecouple resource consumption from economic growth. \\nTo achieve this goal, it is relying on the support of its sup -\\npliers. With their help, the Group wants to continuously \\nincrease the proportion of secondary and renewable \\nmaterials in its vehicles. \\nPlastics, steel and aluminium have been identified as par -\\nticularly important such materials in Mercedes-Benz vehi -\\ncles. We need large volumes of these materials for the \\nproduction of our vehicles, and their extraction and pro -\\ncessing also consume large amounts of energy and \\nresources. \\nPlastics and recyclates: throughout their entire life \\ncycles, vehicles from the Mercedes-Benz brand are in \\nfuture to be more environmentally friendly and less \\nresource-intensive than before. The cornerstones of this \\napproach involve the use of recyclates and lightweight materials, as well as recyclability. Mercedes-Benz Group \\nrequirement specifications already define a minimum pro -\\nportion of recycled material for each component in new \\nMercedes-Benz cars. This proportion varies depending on \\nthe vehicle model and series in question. As part of its \\nsustainable business strategy, the Mercedes-Benz Group \\nalso relies on the use of natural fibres and textiles as a \\nmeans of replacing conventional plastics with renewable \\nraw materials.\\nSteel: The use of secondary materials such as steel scrap \\ncan reduce primary resource requirements in line with a \\ncircular economy. For example, Mercedes-Benz AG and its \\npartner therefore ensure the recycling of scrap steel from \\nthe Mercedes-Benz Cars plant in Sindelfingen, Germany.\\nAluminium: Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz \\nVans already use recycled materials, including recycled \\naluminium, in numerous series-production vehicles. Alu -\\nminium is a light metal that can be recycled without any \\nloss of quality, and the recycling process for aluminium \\nuses less energy than would be required to produce new \\naluminium. In order to continue increasing its use of recy -\\ncled materials, Mercedes-Benz AG is working with its sup -\\npliers to develop aluminium alloys with high end-of-life \\nscrap potential — from old vehicles or packaging, for \\nexample. In addition, by amending existing supply agree -\\nments, Mercedes-Benz AG and its suppliers continued to \\nwork on the decarbonization of the aluminium supply \\nchain for all of their production operations in Europe. At \\nleast one third of the primary aluminium that will be used \\nfor new electric models in Europe is to be produced using \\nenergy from renewable sources.In 2020, secondary material targets were defined for \\nMercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans, and these \\nwere then firmly incorporated into the requirements for \\ncontract awards. In the reporting year, the Company car -\\nried out a model series-specific analysis at component \\nlevel in order to realize further potential for increasing \\nsecondary materials. Project milestones and the status of \\nprojects with regard to the use of secondary materials are \\npresented on a quarterly basis in the executive bodies for \\nthe various model series. The responsible member of the \\nBoard of Management of Mercedes-Benz Cars and the \\nresponsible executive management team member of \\nMercedes-Benz Vans are also provided with information \\non a regular basis within the framework of the activities of \\na committee that manages strategic sustainability matters. \\nWith its Responsible Sourcing Standards, the Mercedes-\\nBenz Group has also defined other environmental require -\\nments in its supplier agreements. Further information can \\nbe found in the “Sustainability in the supply chain” section.\\nSuppliers of production materials to Mercedes-Benz Cars \\nand Mercedes-Benz Vans are expected to operate with an \\nenvironmental management system that is certified \\naccording to ISO 14001 or EMAS. Depending on the spe -\\ncific risks, this also applies to suppliers of non-production \\nmaterials and services.\\nMercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans are also \\ncooperating with organizations such as CDP (formerly Car -\\nbon Disclosure Project) so that they can depict the envi -\\nronmental impact of their supply chains even more trans -\\nparently.

That’s why \\nthe goal of the Mercedes-Benz Group is to increasingly \\ndecouple its consumption of resources from the growth \\nof its production volume. \\nThe consumption of resources in production plays an \\nimportant role in the environmental compatibility of \\nvehicles. For this reason, the Mercedes-Benz Group is \\nworking continuously to make production more efficient \\nand more environmentally compatible. In order to \\nimprove its environmental footprint in production operations, the Group has set reduction targets for \\nenergy, water and waste at all of its production sites \\nworldwide.\\nIn order to achieve its goals, the Group uses Group-\\nwide resource management with its environmental and \\nenergy management systems to ensure that appropriate \\nmeasures are developed, adapted to challenges where \\nnecessary, and monitored.\\nIn order to ensure efficient, high-quality, and environ-\\nmentally friendly manufacturing operations, the Group \\nhas established an environmental management system \\ncertified in accordance with ISO 14001 at its production \\nsites around the world. All German manufacturing loca-\\ntions and the two European production sites in \\nKecskemét, Hungary, and Vitoria, Spain, have also been \\nvalidated in accordance with EMAS. In addition, the \\nGerman production sites have had energy management \\nsystems conforming to DIN EN ISO 50001 in place since \\n2012, and the Group has these systems certified every \\nthree years. The Mercedes-Benz Group is currently also \\nimplementing ISO 50001 systems at a number of indi-\\nvidual sites outside Germany, for example in Kecskemét \\nin Hungary, Jawor in Poland and Vitoria in Spain. In \\naddition, during the year under review the Mercedes-\\nBenz Group also moved ahead with the introduction on \\nan international scale of energy management systems \\ncertified in accordance with ISO 50001. New manage-\\nment systems were implemented in Pune, India, and \\nSebes, Romania, for example. The effectiveness of the management systems is moni-\\ntored by external auditors as part of the certification \\nprocess (ISO 14001, EMAS, ISO 50001), as well as in the \\nenvironmental sector by internal environmental risk \\nassessments (environmental due diligence process). \\nThe Group also has a standardized process in place for \\nreviewing and assessing its consolidated production \\nsites every five years.

The focus here is \\nmainly on preventative measures that the Group contin-\\nuously reviews and develops further.\\nRequirements, policies, organization and \\nresponsibilities\\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group’s occupational safety strat -\\negy includes standards for the design of workplaces \\nand work processes in order to systematically reduce \\noccupational and health-related risks. There are inter -\\nnational Group policies on occupational health and \\nsafety as well as uniform principles that must be \\nadhered to. The internal guidelines are based on inter -\\nnational standards and require compliance with \\nnational laws. They emphasize the responsibility of \\nmanagers and the personal responsibility of employees. \\nThe international Group Occupational Health and Safety \\nPolicy specifies binding tasks, duties, necessary bodies \\nand communication requirements for all controlled and \\nconsolidated companies. This policy is based on the \\nISO 45001 standard. The policy is valid for all employ -\\nees as well as temporary workers whose work and/or \\nworkplace is controlled by the organization.Occupational health and safety issues throughout the \\nGroup are managed by the Health & Safety unit, which \\nis part of Human Relations. The topics are regularly dis -\\ncussed and decided on in various committees.\\nRisk management\\nRisk management follows the Group policy on occupa-\\ntional health and safety and defines instruments and \\nrisk assessment processes that are to be implemented \\nlocally. The Mercedes-Benz Group’s Health & Safety unit \\ntakes a preventative approach so that employees do \\nnot have accidents or suffer from impaired health. In \\norder to identify significant risks at an early stage, an \\nevaluation (safety due diligence) is carried out every \\nfive years at all consolidated and controlled production \\nsites with more than 500 employees. Risk assessment \\nis an important tool for evaluating potential risks and \\ndefining measures. At the Mercedes-Benz Group, this is \\ndone with the help of standardized and globally availa-\\nble software, for example. The Mercedes-Benz Group \\nalso assesses the mental and ergonomic stress caused \\nby workplaces and the working environment.\\nCompany health management and mental health\\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group offers its employees in Ger -\\nmany occupational health advice and screening as well \\nas measures and services from the company’s own \\nhealth programme and social counselling service.

For decades, the Mercedes-Benz \\nGroup’s own systematic accident research, which is \\nintegrated into vehicle development, has formed the \\nbasis for new safety systems. This research also analy -\\nses real accidents and uses the knowledge gained from \\nsuch analyses to assess new technologies from a vehi-\\ncle safety perspective. \\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group utilizes its holistic Integral \\nSafety concept in its vehicle development activities. \\nThis concept describes how Mercedes-Benz divides the \\nutilization of safety systems into four phases: assis -\\ntance during driving, preparation for a possible acci-\\ndent, protection during an accident and help after an \\naccident. The Group’s safety measures establish a \\nbridge between active and passive safety within these \\nfour phases\\xa0— i.e. between accident prevention (phases \\n1 and 2) and protection when an accident occurs \\n(phases 3 and 4). The objectives and decisions in the \\narea of road safety are assured by the Steering Commit -\\ntee Integral Safety (LK IS) and implemented in conjunc -\\ntion with the participants of the product projects. The \\nLK IS reports directly to the Research & Development \\nExecutive Committee of Mercedes-Benz AG.Cooperation to further improve vehicle safety\\nThe goal of increasing safety on the road can only be \\nachieved though collaboration, and that is why the \\nMercedes-Benz Group establishes partnerships and \\nparticipates in research projects.

The Mercedes-Benz Group’s specialists are \\ncontinuously working on increasing road safety and \\nequipping vehicles — across several SAE levels right up \\nto automated driving — with ever more powerful assistance systems that can help to prevent accidents \\nor reduce their severity. For example, Mercedes-Benz \\nvehicles equipped with driving assistance systems can \\nsupport drivers when they steer, brake and accelerate \\n(SAE Level 2). \\nDriving assistance systems can react differently to the \\ndanger of a collision, depending on the situation. The \\nActive Brake Assist system, which comes as standard \\nequipment in Mercedes-Benz cars, is a good example of \\nthis. Active Brake Assist can help reduce the severity \\nof\\xa0— or entirely prevent\\xa0— accidents involving vehicles \\nahead or pedestrians crossing the carriageway. Speed \\nLimit Assist, for example, notifies the driver of the cur -\\nrent speed limit. It has been standard equipment in the \\nMercedes-Benz A-Class since 2018.

The Group is \\nstrongly committed to responsible conduct. It expects \\nits employees to comply with laws, regulations and vol -\\nuntary self-commitments, and helps them do so. The \\nMercedes-Benz Group has laid down these expecta-\\ntions in a binding form in its Integrity Code. Through its \\nCompliance Management System (CMS), the Mercedes-\\nBenz Group aims to promote compliance with laws and \\npolicies. The necessary measures are defined by the \\ncompliance organization in a process that also takes \\nthe company’s business requirements into account in \\nan appropriate manner. The CMS consists of basic prin-\\nciples and measures that promote compliant behaviour. \\nIt is applied worldwide. The CMS encompasses seven elements that build on one another: Compliance Val -\\nues; Compliance Targets; Compliance Organization; \\nCompliance Risks; Compliance Programme; Training; \\nand Monitoring and Improvement.\\nEach year, the Mercedes-Benz Group checks the pro-\\ncesses and measures of the CMS and conducts analy -\\nses to find out whether the measures are appropriate \\nand effective. For these activities, it relies on informa-\\ntion from the Group companies as well as additional \\nlocally gathered information. The Group also monitors \\ntheir processes on the basis of key performance indica-\\ntors. To determine these indicators, the Mercedes-Benz \\nGroup checks, among other things, whether formal \\nrequirements are being met and whether the content is \\ncomplete. It also takes into account the knowledge \\ngained through both internal and independent external \\nassessments.\\nWhenever new legal requirements or findings from risk \\nanalyses call for adjustments, the Mercedes-Benz \\nGroup adapts the CMS accordingly. The Group compa-\\nnies are required to implement the improvement meas -\\nures derived from this process. In addition, the respon-\\nsible management committees are informed about the \\nresults of their monitoring process.\\nCompliance organization\\nThe compliance organization at the Mercedes-Benz \\nGroup is structured functionally, regionally and along \\nthe value chain. As a result, it can provide effective \\nsupport\\xa0— for example, by means of guidelines and advice. Contact persons are available to each function \\nand region. In addition, a global network of local \\nofficers makes sure that the Group’s compliance stand-\\nards are met. The contact persons help the manage-\\nment at the Group companies implement the compli-\\nance programme at their respective sites.\\nThe Compliance Board provides guidance regarding \\noverarching compliance topics and monitors whether \\nthe associated Group measures are effective. The \\nBoard’s mission is to react promptly to changes in busi-\\nness models and the business environment, deal with \\nregulatory developments and continuously enhance the \\nCMS. The Compliance Board consists of representatives \\nof the compliance, integrity and legal affairs area. It \\nmeets regularly and as needed, and is chaired by the \\nChief Compliance Officer (CCO). \\nThe CCO reports directly to the member of the Board of \\nManagement responsible for Integrity, Governance & \\nSustainability as well as to the Audit Committee of the \\nSupervisory Board. He or she also reports regularly to \\nthe Board of Management at regular intervals and as \\nneeded on matters such as the status of the CMS and \\nits further development, as well as the Business & Peo-\\nple Protection Office (BPO) whistleblower system.

The programme establishes a bind-\\ning, globally valid Group standard that defines how \\nmatters of antitrust law are to be assessed. In addition \\nto Mercedes-Benz Group AG’s central Legal and Com-\\npliance department, the Group’s global divisions can \\nturn to local legal and compliance advisers. Employees \\nreceive further support through advice hotlines, guide-\\nlines and practical support. Ensuring compliance with product requirements \\nFor the Mercedes-Benz Group, technical Compliance \\nmeans adhering to technical and regulatory require-\\nments, laws and standards. The objective here is to \\nidentify risks within the product creation process (prod-\\nuct development and certification) at an early stage and \\nto implement preventive measures. For this purpose, \\nthe Group established a technical Compliance Manage-\\nment System (tCMS) in its automotive divisions. Its \\nobjective is to ensure that Mercedes-Benz Cars and \\nMercedes-Benz Vans comply with all legal and regula-\\ntory requirements throughout the entire product devel -\\nopment and certification process. The tCMS defines \\nvalues, principles, structures and processes in order to \\nprovide employees with guidance and orientation, \\nespecially with regard to challenging questions on how \\nto interpret technical regulations.\\nThe “Speak up” and “Judgement calls” commitment \\nstatements provide all employees in the development \\nand certification units with a basis for a common \\nunderstanding of responsible behaviour in the product \\ncreation process. They were drawn up jointly by Integ -\\nrity Management and R&D departments and are further \\nembedded by internal departmental measures. \\nResponsible handling of data \\nEnsuring the protection of personal data (data privacy) \\nand information security is a top priority at the \\nMercedes-Benz Group. The Mercedes-Benz Group \\nregards the protection of personal data and the security \\nof IT systems as essential components of comprehen-\\nsive data governance. The key aims are the sustainable design of data-based business models and the respon-\\nsible, ethical and legally compliant use of data in the \\ninterests of customers, employees and other stakehold-\\ners. To achieve these strategic goals, the Mercedes-\\nBenz Group is pursuing a systematic approach. Key ele-\\nments are the data governance structure, the data \\nvision, the data culture and the aforementioned Data \\nCMS. \\nThe implementation of data governance in the divisions \\nof the Mercedes-Benz Group is the responsibility of  \\nthe various bodies for data and data analytics. Within \\nthe Mercedes-Benz Group there is also a Digital Gov -\\nernance Board that includes members of the Board of \\nManagement.

The Privacy \\nCenter already covers various such processing activi-\\nties, and more are planned. The portal can be accessed \\non the web and via the new version of the Mercedes me \\nApp launched in the year under review. \\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group is also working on the further \\ndevelopment and implementation of data sharing solu-\\ntions.

In addition, \\nthe Mercedes-Benz Group is continuously working on \\ntechnologies to promote privacy, and it made new \\ndevelopments available internally in the reporting year. \\nThe aim is to include privacy-enhancing technologies, among others, in the product design process right from \\nthe start.\\nPrevention of money laundering and terrorist \\nfinancing \\nMoney laundering and the financing of terrorism cause \\ntremendous damage\\xa0to the economy and society.

The latter was the second such audit, \\nthe first having been conducted in 2016. \\nThe whistleblower system BPO\\nThe Business & People Protection Office (BPO) whistle-\\nblower system enables all employees worldwide, as \\nwell as external informants, to report violations of the \\nrules. The BPO is available around the clock to receive \\ninformation, which can be sent by e-mail or normal mail \\nor by filling out a special online form. External toll-free \\nhotlines are also available in Brazil, Japan, South Africa \\nand the United States. Reports can also be submitted \\nanonymously if local laws permit this. In Germany, \\nwhistleblowers have access to additional contact points \\nsuch as an external neutral intermediary and other \\nexternal reporting channels (e.g. the federal govern-\\nment’s external reporting office at the Federal Office of \\nJustice, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority’s \\n(BaFin’s) whistleblower office, and the whistleblower \\nsystem of the Bundeskartellamt (federal competition \\nauthority).The information provided to the BPO whistleblower sys -\\ntem enables the Mercedes-Benz Group to learn about \\npotential risks and thus to prevent damage to the Group \\nand its employees or to third parties, as well as to pro-\\ntect individuals who might be harmed by misconduct. A \\nglobally valid Group policy defines BPO procedures and \\nthe corresponding responsibilities. It aims to ensure a \\nfair and transparent procedure that takes into account \\nboth the protection of the whistleblower and the princi-\\nple of proportionality for the persons affected by the \\nallegation. The policy also defines the standard by \\nwhich the Mercedes-Benz Group assesses breaches of \\nthe rules and decides on the consequences. \\nIf, following a risk-based initial assessment, the BPO \\nclassifies an incident as a breach of regulations with a \\nhigh risk for the Mercedes-Benz Group, its employees or \\nother persons, it refers the case to an investigation unit. \\nThe BPO accompanies the subsequent investigation \\nuntil the case is closed. Examples of high-risk rule vio-\\nlations include offences related to corruption, breaches \\nof antitrust law and violations of anti-money laundering \\nregulations, as well as infringements of binding techni-\\ncal provisions or environmental protection regulations. \\nPersonal matters, such as incidents of sexual harass -\\nment or human rights violations, are also considered \\nhigh-risk rule violations. \\nThe BPO refers information on all other breaches involv -\\ning risk to the responsible department — such as HR, \\nCorporate Security or Data Privacy. The relevant depart -\\nments follow up the information and clarify the cases \\non their own responsibility. Examples include theft, breach of trust, and undue enrichment valued at less \\nthan €100,000\\xa0— if the violation does not fall into the \\ncategory of corruption.\\nIn an effort to constantly increase trust in the BPO \\nwhistleblower system and make it even better known to \\nemployees, the Mercedes-Benz Group uses various \\ncommunication measures to provide extensive informa-\\ntion materials in a variety of languages. In addition, the \\ncompany regularly informs employees about the type \\nand number of reported violations and makes case \\nstudies available in an anonymous form on a quarterly \\nbasis.\\nReported violations \\nIn the reporting year, 55 new cases were opened with \\n75 persons affected by the allegation (previous year:  \\n58 cases/72 persons). In total, 54 persons were proven \\nto have committed violations with a high risk for the \\ncompany, its employees or other persons.

During the ongoing \\ncooperation with the sales partners, the existing due \\ndiligence processes are reviewed on an ad hoc or cycli-\\ncal basis depending on the risks identified. Another \\ncomponent of the due diligence process is permanent \\nmonitoring, in which the Group continuously checks \\nexisting sales partners in relevant databases and valid \\nsanctions lists in order to identify potential breaches of \\nintegrity. If a partner fails to comply with the Group \\nstandards or if there are breaches of integrity that can-\\nnot be resolved, the Mercedes-Benz Group reserves the \\nright to terminate the selection process or the coopera-\\ntion.

This applies to \\nnearly all of our investments.\\nTaxonomy-alignment of capital expenditure \\nTo calculate the Taxonomy-aligned proportion of eco-\\nnomic activities (under A.1 in the table Capital expendi-\\nture), capital expenditure was examined to determine \\nthe extent to which it was associated with low-carbon \\nvehicles (economic activities 3.3 and 6.5) and with \\nhigh-power charging stations (economic activity 6.15) in \\norder to assess whether a substantial contribution had \\nbeen made to climate change mitigation. Table Capital \\nexpenditure (p. 121) shows the Taxonomy-aligned capi-\\ntal expenditure, aggregated across all economic activi-ties. Compliance with the DNSH criteria was  \\nalso monitored. \\nThe size of the share of Taxonomy-aligned expenditure \\nof total capital expenditure is mainly due to the dispro-\\nportionately low share of Taxonomy-aligned vehicles  \\nin the additions to the equipment on operating leases. \\nAs a result, this share only partially reflects our invest -\\nments in sustainable products for the future.\\nWhen looking at Taxonomy-aligned investments in \\nintangible assets (mainly in capitalized development \\ncosts) and property, plant and equipment of the \\nMercedes-Benz Group shows much higher shares of \\nTaxonomy-aligned capital expenditure (table Capital \\nexpenditure). \\nAll of the capital expenditure of the Mercedes-Benz \\nGroup during the reporting year included in the numer -\\nator of the economic activities 3.3 and 6.5 relates to \\nassets or processes in the context of already existing \\ntechnologies which are connected to already existing \\nTaxonomy-aligned economic activities 3.3 and 6.5. For \\nmost of the capital expenditure relating to the industrial \\nbusiness, a direct attribution was made to all-electric \\nvehicle projects. In the case of capital expenditure in \\nlow-carbon plug-in hybrids and assets that are used to \\nproduce both vehicles with combustion engines and \\nlow-carbon vehicles, suitable allocations based on \\nplanned vehicle sales figures for the respective model \\nseries or vehicle platforms were used.

As a result, revenue was slightly above \\nthe prior-year figure. This was primarily due to improved \\npricing at the automotive segments.\\nIn the past year, the Group achieved EBIT on a par with \\nthe previous year. At the beginning of the year, it had \\nexpected EBIT to be slightly below the prior-year figure. \\nThe Group’s EBIT forecast was already raised during the \\nyear, primarily due to the positive results performance \\nin the Mercedes-Benz Vans segment.\\nThe free cash flow of the industrial business even sig -\\nnificantly exceeded the previous year’s figure as a result \\nof lower working capital than expected. At the begin-\\nning of the reporting year, the figure had been expected \\nto remain at the previous year’s level. The forecast was \\nalready raised during the year to a figure slightly above \\nthe previous year’s level. \\n1   The Mercedes-Benz CO 2 pool not only includes newly registered Mercedes-Benz cars,  \\nbut also vans that were registered as passenger cars and, since 2023, vehicles from  \\nthe joint venture smart Automobile Co., Ltd. (smart vehicles). The average CO 2 emissions  \\nare determined using the WLTP type test procedure.According to internal calculations, the average CO 2 \\nemissions of the Mercedes-Benz CO 2 pool1 in Europe \\n(European Union, Norway and Iceland) amounted to \\n109 g/km in the reporting year. The emissions were thus \\nsignificantly below the prior-year value of 115 g/km.  \\nIt should be noted that the internal calculation of the \\nvalue of 109 g/km was the first time that vehicles from \\nthe joint venture smart Automobile Co., Ltd. were \\nincluded in the Mercedes-Benz CO 2 pool. Excluding \\nthese smart vehicles, the value of 111 g/km was only \\nslightly below the previous year’s figure. This is due to  \\na more difficult than expected market environment for \\nelectrified vehicles in Europe.\\nRobust demand for Top-End and all-electric vehicles \\nfrom Mercedes -Benz Cars supported the development \\nin unit sales and revenue, which, as expected, remained \\nat the previous year’s level. \\nThe segment had expected an adjusted return on sales \\nof between 12 and 14%. Improved pricing, particularly in \\nthe first half of the year, combined with continued high \\ncost discipline led to an adjusted return on sales of 12.6%. This confirmed the assessment made at the \\nbeginning of the year.\\nAt 0.9, the adjusted cash conversion rate was also \\nwithin the forecast range. \\nSustained cost discipline enabled investments in prop-\\nerty, plant and equipment, which at the start of the year \\nhad been expected to be significantly above the pri-\\nor-year level, to be held at the same level. Research and \\ndevelopment expenditure was also significantly higher \\nthan in the previous year, because the new, electromo-\\nbility-oriented platform generation and the associated \\ndrive concept, as well as the focus on digitalization and \\nautomated driving, led to a higher-than-expected \\nincrease. The company had expected research and \\ndevelopment expenditure to be slightly above the pri-\\nor-year level.Overall Assessment of the Financial Year'),\n",

A continued very high demand for \\nMercedes-Benz vans resulted in unit sales and revenue \\nsignificantly above those of the previous year. This \\nunderlines the strategy of focussing on profitable \\ngrowth in the premium segment. At the beginning of the \\nyear, unit sales were expected to be at the previous \\nyear’s level; revenue was expected to be slightly above \\nthe previous year’s level. \\nThanks to a compelling level of product quality and util -\\nity, a significant improvement in pricing, a very favoura-\\nble product mix, comprehensive initiatives to reduce \\ncosts on the product, production and company levels \\nand an increase in productivity, an adjusted return on \\nsales of 15.1% was achieved. This figure was thus \\nslightly above the range of between 13% and 15%, \\nwhich had already been raised significantly during the \\nyear. \\nThe adjusted cash conversion rate also increased to 1.0 \\nas a result of the business performance being signifi-\\ncantly better than expected at the beginning of the year. \\nAs expected, investments in property, plant and equip-\\nment and research and development expenditure were \\nsignificantly higher than in the previous year.Mercedes -Benz Mobility closed 2023 within the \\nexpected range despite a declining interest margin due \\nto higher interest rates and increased competition in \\nthe financial services sector. Furthermore, the business \\nactivities in Russia were sold as planned, but nonethe-\\nless negatively impacted results. The opening of the \\nfirst Mercedes-Benz Charging Hubs in the fourth quarter \\nlaid the foundation for the Group’s own global high-\\npower charging network.\\nContract volume was slightly above the prior-year level. \\nAt the beginning of the reporting year, Mercedes-Benz \\nMobility had expected contract volume to decline \\nslightly. The main reasons for the deviation from the \\nforecast were the growth in the area of dealer financing \\nand higher average financing and leasing volumes for \\nnew contracts.\\nRevenue at Mercedes-Benz Mobility was on a par with \\nthe previous year. The original forecast of a level signifi-\\ncantly below the previous year was exceeded due to \\nhigher customer income as a result of passing on \\nincreased interest rates and a higher average financing \\nand leasing volume for new contracts.\\nWith an adjusted return on equity of 12.3%, the forecast \\nrange was achieved.'),\n",

These plans are based \\non the premises the company sets regarding the eco-\\nnomic situation and the development of automotive \\nmarkets. It involves assessments made by the Group, \\nwhich are based on analyses by various renowned eco-\\nnomic research institutes, international organizations \\nand industry associations, as well as on the internal \\nmarket analyses of the Group sales companies. \\nThe premises regarding the economic situation and the \\ndevelopment of automotive markets continue to be \\ncharacterized by an exceptional degree of uncertainty. \\nIn addition to unexpected macroeconomic develop-\\nments, uncertainties for the global economy and the \\nbusiness development of the Mercedes-Benz Group \\nmay arise in particular from geopolitical events and \\ntrade policy. Among them are the current Middle East \\nconflict, the Russia-Ukraine war and other potential \\nregional crises. Other uncertainties that are particularly \\nworth mentioning include an exacerbation of tensions \\nbetween the United States and China and a further \\ndeterioration of political relations between the Euro-\\npean Union and China. Further supply chain disruptions and, in particular, \\navailability bottlenecks for critical components remain \\nsignificant risk factors. Sharp rises in energy and com-\\nmodity prices, higher-than-expected inflation rates and \\ninterest rates, potential disruptions of the financial \\nmarket and an even more pronounced slowdown in \\neconomic growth in individual regions or worldwide \\nmay also have an impact on the development of the \\nworld economy and the automotive markets.\\nThe risks and opportunities that can arise as a result of \\ndeviations from the forecasts of the development of the \\nworld economy and automotive markets that are pre-\\nsented below are described in the Risk and Opportunity \\nReport. \\nThe continuous planning process makes it possible for \\nthe Group to ensure that available opportunities can be \\nexploited and that the organization can respond appro-\\npriately to unexpected risks. This in turn means that \\nexpectations regarding anticipated business develop-\\nment can be adjusted in line with the latest forecasts of \\nthe development of automotive markets.The world economy  \\nand  automotive markets\\nThe world economy\\nThe Group expects the world economy to continue to \\ngrow at a slower pace in 2024. This slowdown will mainly \\nbe driven by the major industrial countries, whose eco-\\nnomic development, at least in the first half of the \\nyear, will likely be affected by persistently high inter -\\nest rates. In contrast, the monetary easing cycle that \\nstarted in numerous emerging markets in 2023, should \\nserve to support economic growth in those countries. \\nWith regard to the euro zone, the absence of monetary \\nand fiscal policy stimuli can be expected to lead to  \\ncontinued economic weakness in the first half of the \\nyear at least. Given the insufficient order situation and \\npersistently high interest rates, no real recovery to \\nspeak of can be expected for industrial sectors in par -\\nticular.

Unit sales for \\nthe US light vehicle market are also likely to slightly \\nexceed the level recorded in the previous year. A slight \\nincrease in market volume is also expected for China. \\nGrowth in key van markets is expected to slow notice-\\nably in 2024.

The \\nassessment of market risks and opportunities is linked \\nto forecasts about the overall economic conditions and \\nthe development of the automotive markets in which \\nthe Mercedes-Benz Group is active. These assumptions \\nare described in detail in the “Outlook” section. The \\npossibility of markets developing better or worse than \\nin the internal forecasts and assumptions, or of chang -\\ning market conditions, generally exists for all segments \\nof the Group.\\nPossible declines in vehicle sales may be caused in \\nparticular by an unfavourable macroeconomic environ-\\nment for the Mercedes-Benz Group and in the context \\nof political or economic uncertainties. In addition to \\nweaker economic growth overall, factors such as high \\nenergy prices, high inflation and interest rates, and vol -\\natile exchange rates may lead to market uncertainty or \\na loss of purchasing power and have a negative impact \\non demand in the automotive sector. A lower-than-ex -\\npected market acceptance of electric vehicles can also \\nlead to risks in the development of unit sales and have \\na negative impact on earnings. This could also endanger \\nthe achievement of specific CO 2 targets. Industrial pol -\\nicy measures to strengthen local value creation in vari-\\nous countries, as well as government purchase incentives for locally produced electric vehicles, can \\nresult in competitive disadvantages and declining vehi-\\ncle sales in the respective markets. The development of \\nmarkets, unit sales and inventories is continually ana-\\nlysed and monitored by the automotive segments; if \\nnecessary, specific marketing and sales programmes \\nare implemented.\\nVolatilities with regard to market developments can \\nalso lead to the overall market or regional conditions for \\nthe automotive industry developing better than \\nassumed in the internal forecasts and premises, result -\\ning in business opportunities in the market. Opportuni-\\nties may also arise from an improvement in the compet -\\nitive situation or a more positive development of \\ndemand. The utilization of opportunities is supported \\nby sales and marketing campaigns.\\nThe launch of new products by competitors, more \\naggressive pricing policies and less effective pricing for \\nproducts such as electric vehicles can lead to increas -\\ning competitive and price pressure in the automotive \\nsegments and have a negative impact on profitability. \\nThe discontinuation or reduction of government subsi-\\ndies for electric vehicles can also negatively affect their \\npricing and cut profit margins. There is also a risk of \\ndelayed market introduction of new technologies in \\nvehicles. Continuous monitoring is carried out in order \\nto recognize risks at an early stage. Depending on the \\nsituation, product-specific and possibly regionally dif -\\nferent measures are taken to support weaker markets. \\nOpportunities exist in particular in the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment due to better-than-planned effective \\npricing of vehicles. \\nIn connection with the sale of vehicles, the Mercedes-\\nBenz Group offers customers a wide range of financ -\\ning and leasing options. The resulting risks for the \\nMercedes-Benz Mobility segment are mainly due to \\nborrowers’ worsening creditworthiness, so receivables \\nmight not be recoverable in whole or in part because  \\nof customers’ insolvency (default or credit risk).  \\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group counteracts credit risks by \\nmeans of creditworthiness checks on the basis of \\nstandardized scoring and rating methods, the collater -\\nalization of receivables, and effective risk manage-\\nment with a firm focus on monitoring both internal \\nand macroeconomic leading indicators.\\nIn connection with leasing agreements, risks and \\nopportunities also arise due to the development of the \\nused vehicle markets. These result when the market \\nvalue of a leased vehicle at the end of the agreement \\nterm differs from the residual value that was originally \\ncalculated and forecast on the basis of specific \\nassumptions at the time the agreement was concluded \\nand used as a basis for the leasing instalments. Residu-\\nal-value management processes have been defined to \\ncounteract these risks relating to vehicles’ residual \\nvalues. Depending on the region and the current mar -\\nket situation, the measures taken generally include con-\\ntinuous market monitoring as well as, if required, \\nprice-setting strategies or sales promotion measures \\ndesigned to regulate vehicle inventories.

Regu-\\nlations concerning vehicles’ emissions, fuel consump-\\ntion, safety and certification, as well as tariff aspects \\nand taxes in connection with the sale or purchase of \\nvehicles or vehicle parts, play an important role. Geo-\\npolitical tensions can also have a significant impact on \\nthe business activities of an international company \\nsuch as the Mercedes-Benz Group. \\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group constantly monitors the \\ndevelopment of the legal and political framework and \\nattempts to anticipate foreseeable requirements and \\nlong-term objectives at an early stage in the product \\ndevelopment process. In particular, changes in the legal \\nand political framework at short notice can be associ-\\nated with additional costs or higher investments. Legal limits on the fuel consumption and/or CO 2 emis -\\nsions of car fleets exist in many markets, although the \\ntarget values differ from market to market. Non-compli-\\nance with regulations applicable in the various markets \\nmight result in significant penalties and reputational \\nharm, and might even mean that vehicles with conven-\\ntional drive systems could not or could no longer be \\nregistered in the relevant markets. The Mercedes-Benz \\nGroup counteracts this risk through the transformation \\ntowards electric mobility and the associated realign-\\nment of its product portfolio. Mercedes-Benz Cars and \\nMercedes-Benz Vans face the described risks with \\nrespect to regulations concerning mandatory targets for \\nthe average fleet fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions \\nof new vehicles especially in the markets of China, \\nEurope and the United States. The Mercedes-Benz \\nGroup gives these targets due consideration in its prod-\\nuct and sales planning. The market success of alterna-\\ntive drive systems is greatly influenced not only by cus -\\ntomer acceptance but also by regional market \\nconditions such as the battery-charging infrastructure, \\nstate support and tax conditions.Political tensions and the associated danger of geopo-\\nlitical conflicts continue to be high and are associ-\\nated with far-reaching risks for the business develop-\\nment of the Mercedes-Benz Group. A further \\nescalation of tensions between China and the United \\nStates and between China and the EU, the possible \\nfurther escalation of the war between Russia and \\nUkraine and, above all, the conflict in the Middle East, \\nthe flare-up of further regional conflicts and a possible \\nmilitary or non-military escalation in the entire South \\nChina Sea could lead to renewed tensions in supply \\nchains, even higher energy prices, renewed pressure \\non inflation rates and a further deterioration in the \\ngrowth outlook. A further escalation and possible geo-\\ngraphical expansion of the Russia-Ukraine war could \\nespecially have a negative impact on purchasing and \\nlogistics processes and on the production and sales \\nprogramme. A possible bottleneck in energy supply in \\nthe EU could also lead to potential production losses \\nat the Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans \\nplants. The above-mentioned risks are monitored on \\nan ongoing basis and mitigation measures, such as \\nsubstituting other energy sources for gas or imple-\\nmenting energy-saving measures, are initiated accord-\\ningly; possible scenarios are continuously adjusted to \\nthe current geopolitical situation and analysed.'),\n",

For example, setting up or expanding \\nproduction facilities, increasing local purchasing or \\nintroducing a requirement to carry out local research \\nand development can result in significantly increased \\ninvestment or higher running costs. In addition, barriers \\nto market access such as more difficult or delayed cer -\\ntification processes or very complicated tariff proce-\\ndures can make it more difficult to import into those \\ncountries. Investing in those countries can limit the \\nimpact of protectionist measures. \\nProcurement market risks and opportunities \\nRisks and opportunities relating to procurement arise \\nfor the automotive segments in particular from fluctua-\\ntions in prices of commodities, raw materials and \\nenergy. Certain raw materials and components are \\nrequired for the manufacture of vehicles and parts and \\nare purchased on the world market. The level of costs \\ndepends on the price development of commodities, \\nraw materials and energy, and can result in both oppor -\\ntunities and risks for the Mercedes-Benz Group.\\nFor 2024, there are still risks from inflation-related \\nincreases in raw material and energy prices, which \\ncould lead to higher procurement costs. Furthermore, \\nintense competition for specific raw materials in the \\ncourse of the introduction of new technologies can lead \\nto increasing costs or possible shortages in the supply \\nchain. Raw-material markets can always be impacted  \\nby uncertainties and political crises — combined with possible supply bottlenecks — as well as by volatile \\ndemand for specific raw materials. The ability to pass \\non the higher costs of commodities and other materials \\nin the form of higher prices for manufactured vehicles is \\nlimited because of strong competitive pressure in the \\ninternational automotive markets. Rising raw-material \\nprices may therefore have a negative impact on the \\nprofit margins of the vehicles sold and thus lead to \\nlower earnings in the respective segment. In order to \\ncounteract possible loss of revenue, the Mercedes-\\nBenz Group continuously monitors the development of \\nraw-material and energy prices and is in close touch \\nwith suppliers.\\nCompany-specific  \\nrisks and opportunities \\nRisks and opportunities from research  \\nand development \\nTechnical developments and innovations are of key \\nimportance for the safe and sustainable mobility of the \\nfuture. The transformation towards electric mobility and \\nthe comprehensive digitalization of vehicles has \\nresulted in ambitious development targets and the mar -\\nket launch of new technologies. In addition to the \\nresulting opportunities, decisions in favour of certain \\ntechnologies and the continuously growing scope of \\nemission, consumption and safety requirements to be \\nmet are associated with risks. There are risks that vehicles cannot be developed \\nwithin the planned time frame, in the appropriate qual -\\nity or at the specified costs. This is particularly the case \\nwith regard to electric mobility and increasing digitali-\\nzation as well as software in the vehicle architecture. \\nThere is also a risk that certain digital functions could \\nbe launched on the market later than planned. Supply \\nchain disruptions can also lead to delays in vehicle \\ndevelopment processes and postpone the launch of \\nindividual model series. The Mercedes-Benz Group \\ncounters these risks by continuously and systematically \\nmonitoring all vehicle projects.\\nIn 2020, Mercedes-Benz Group\\xa0AG and Mercedes-Benz \\nUSA, LLC (MBUSA) reached agreements with various  \\nUS authorities to settle civil and environmental claims \\nregarding emission control systems of certain diesel \\nvehicles, which have taken legal effect. If the obliga-\\ntions from the settlements are not complied with, there \\nwill be the risk that cost-intensive measures will have \\nto be taken and/or significant stipulated penalties will \\nbecome due.\\nThe risks from research and development have risen \\nfrom “low” to “medium” due to the increasing electrifi-\\ncation and digitalization of the vehicle portfolio.'),\n",

The Mercedes-Benz Group recognizes \\nappropriate provisions for warranty and goodwill cases. \\nNevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that recalls and \\nfield measures will lead to expenses. Possible claims in \\nconnection with such risks are examined and, if neces -\\nsary, the appropriate measures are initiated for the \\naffected products.Possible production interruptions that were still associ-\\nated with the Covid-19 pandemic and the related uncer -\\ntainties have become less likely in the meantime. As a \\nresult, the production risks are reduced from “medium” \\nto “low”.\\nRisks and opportunities from purchasing and \\nlogistics\\nInterruptions in global supply chains, bottlenecks in the \\nsupply of intermediate goods, and production stop-\\npages or underutilization of suppliers' production \\ncapacities can have a negative impact on business \\nactivities in the automotive divisions. Opportunities \\nmay arise, for example, through the implementation of \\nefficiency-enhancing measures in internal logistics pro-\\ncesses.\\nPossible interruptions in global supply chains, espe-\\ncially those caused by bottlenecks for electronic com-\\nponents and other important intermediate goods, can \\ncause bottlenecks at Mercedes-Benz Cars and \\nMercedes-Benz Vans. To avoid such bottleneck situa-\\ntions for intermediate goods, scarce capacities are \\ncountered by planning ahead. Lack of availability and \\nquality problems with certain vehicle parts can lead to \\nproduction downtimes and cause costs that result in \\nnegative effects on profitability. As a globally operating \\ncompany with an international production and sales \\nnetwork, the Mercedes-Benz Group is dependent on \\nfunctioning and efficient logistics processes. In particu-\\nlar, capacity restrictions or surcharges for the transpor -\\ntation of vehicles can disrupt logistics processes, \\nincrease their costs and have a negative impact on the company’s results. Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-\\nBenz Vans analyse these risks on an ongoing basis. \\nSupplier management is undertaken for the prevention \\nof risks with the aim of ensuring the quantity and qual -\\nity of the components required to produce the vehicles. \\nThe financial situation of some suppliers remains diffi-\\ncult. The reasons for this are continuing uncertainties in \\nconnection with high commodity, raw-material and \\nenergy prices, as well as the lack of availability of com-\\nponents. As a result, production stoppages are possi-\\nble along the entire supply chain and could prevent \\nvehicles from being completed and delivered to cus -\\ntomers on time. Supplier risk management aims to \\nidentify potential financial bottlenecks at suppliers at \\nan early stage and to initiate suitable countermeasures. \\nSpecifically, depending on the warning signals recorded \\nand the internal classification, regular reporting dates \\non which key performance indicators are reported to \\nthe Mercedes-Benz Group and any support measures \\ncan be determined if necessary, are agreed upon with \\nsuppliers.\"),\n",

One focus of human resources man-\\nagement is the targeted personnel development and \\nfurther training of the workforce. Among other things, \\nemployees benefit from a wide range of training oppor -\\ntunities and the transparency created within the frame-\\nwork of performance management. In order to remain \\nsuccessful as a company, the way we work together and \\nour leadership culture undergo continuous develop-\\nment.\\nRisks exist in particular due to upcoming negotiations \\non collective bargaining conditions and the associated \\npotential loss of production. Besides the demographic \\ndevelopment, the digital transformation also requires \\nthat the company continues to adapt to changes and \\nderives measures such as securing a qualified next \\ngeneration of specialists and managers, especially with \\nregard to technical developments. This requirement is \\naddressed through various measures, including tar -\\ngeted qualification. The Mercedes-Benz Group counters \\neconomic, market and competitive fluctuations by \\nmeans of established time and flexibility instruments in \\norder to react appropriately to the situation. Risks and opportunities related to equity \\ninvestments and cooperations with partnerships \\nCooperation with partners in shareholdings and part -\\nnerships is of key importance to the Mercedes-Benz \\nGroup — among other things, in the transformation \\ntowards electric mobility, the associated charging infra-\\nstructure and comprehensive digitalization. Coopera-\\ntion and investments also make up an important pillar \\nin connection with the provision of mobility solutions. \\nEspecially with new technologies, these shareholdings \\nhelp us utilize synergies and improve cost structures in \\norder to respond successfully to the competitive situa-\\ntion in the automotive industry. \\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group generally participates in the \\nrisks and opportunities of shareholdings in line with its \\nequity interest, and is also subject to share-price risks \\nand opportunities if such companies are listed on a \\nstock exchange. After the spin-off and hive-down of the \\nDaimler commercial vehicle business, this also applies \\nto the Group’s remaining minority shareholding in \\nDaimler Truck Holding\\xa0AG.\\nThe remeasurement of a holding can lead to risks and \\nopportunities for the segment to which it is allocated. \\nFurthermore, ongoing business activities, especially the \\nintegration of employees, technologies and products, \\ncan result in risks.

The Mercedes-Benz Group employs a vari-\\nety of interest rate-sensitive financial instruments to \\nmanage the cash requirements of its business opera-\\ntions on a day-to-day basis. Most of these financial \\ninstruments are held in connection with the financial \\nservices business of Mercedes-Benz Mobility. Inter -\\nest-rate risks and opportunities arise when fixed-inter -\\nest periods are not congruent between the asset and \\nliability sides of the balance sheet. By means of refi-\\nnancing coordinated with the terms of the financing \\nagreements, the risk of maturity mismatch is minimized \\nfrom both an interest-rate and a liquidity perspective. \\nRemaining interest-rate risks are managed with the use \\nof derivative financial instruments. The funding activi-\\nties of the industrial business and the financial services \\nbusiness are coordinated at the Group level. Derivative \\ninterest-rate instruments such as interest-rate swaps \\nare used to achieve the desired interest-rate maturities \\nand asset/liability structures (asset and liability man-\\nagement). Credit risks\\nCredit risk describes the risk of financial loss resulting \\nfrom a counterparty failing to meet its contractual pay -\\nment obligations. Credit risk encompasses both the \\ndirect risk of default and the risk of a deterioration of \\ncreditworthiness as well as concentration risks.\\nThe Group is exposed to credit risks which result primar -\\nily from its financial services activities and from the \\noperations of its vehicle business. The risks from leasing \\nand sales financing are dealt with in the General market \\nrisks and opportunities section.\\nCredit risks also arise from the Group’s liquid assets. \\nShould defaults occur, this would adversely affect the \\nGroup’s profitability, liquidity and capital resources,  \\nand financial position. The limit methodology for liquid \\nfunds deposited with financial institutions has been \\ncontinuously further developed in recent years. In con-\\nnection with investment decisions, priority is placed on \\nthe borrower’s very high creditworthiness and on bal -\\nanced risk diversification. Most liquid assets are held in \\ninvestments with an external rating of A or better.'),\n",

The Mercedes-Benz Group is \\nexposed to country risks that primarily result from \\ncross-border financing or collateralization for subsidiar -\\nies or customers, from investments in subsidiaries and \\njoint ventures, and from cross-border trade receivables. \\nCountry risks also arise from cross-border cash depos -\\nits at financial institutions. The Group addresses these \\nrisks by setting country limits (e.g. for hard-currency \\nportfolios of Mercedes-Benz Mobility companies). The \\nMercedes-Benz Group also has an internal rating sys -\\ntem that divides all countries in which it operates into \\nrisk categories. Compared to the previous year, the \\ncountry risk has fallen from “high” to “medium” due to \\nthe discontinuation of business activities in Russia. \\nRisks of restricted access to capital markets \\nLiquidity risks arise when a company is unable to fully \\nmeet its financial obligations. In the normal course of \\nbusiness, the Mercedes-Benz Group uses bonds, com-\\nmercial paper and securitized transactions, as well as \\nbank loans in various currencies, primarily with the aim \\nof refinancing its leasing and sales-financing business. \\nAn increase in the cost of refinancing would have a neg -\\native impact on the competitiveness and profitability of \\nthe financial services business to the extent that the \\nhigher refinancing costs cannot be passed on to cus -\\ntomers; a limitation of the financial services business \\nwould also have negative consequences for the vehicle business. Access to capital markets in individual coun-\\ntries may be limited by government regulations or by a \\ntemporary lack of absorption capacity. In addition, \\npending legal proceedings as well as the Group’s own \\nbusiness policy considerations and developments may \\ntemporarily prevent the Group from covering any liquid-\\nity requirements by means of borrowing in the capital \\nmarkets. Contractually agreed credit lines are available \\nas refinancing instruments.  \\nRisks and opportunities from changes in  \\ncredit ratings \\nRisks and opportunities exist in connection with poten-\\ntial downgrades or upgrades to credit ratings by the rat -\\ning agencies, and thus to the Mercedes-Benz Group’s \\ncreditworthiness. Downgrades could have a negative \\nimpact on the Group’s financing if such a downgrade \\nleads to an increase in the costs for external financing \\nor restricts the Group’s ability to obtain financing. A \\ncredit rating downgrade could also discourage inves -\\ntors from investing in Mercedes-Benz Group\\xa0AG or from \\npurchasing bonds issued by Mercedes-Benz Group AG \\nor another company of the Group.\\nRisks and opportunities relating to pension plans \\nThe companies of the Mercedes-Benz Group grant \\ndefined-benefit pension commitments, which are \\nlargely covered by plan assets, as well as healthcare \\ncommitments to a small extent. The balance of pension \\nobligations less plan assets constitutes the carrying \\namount or funded status of those employee benefit \\nplans. The measurement of pension obligations and the \\ncalculation of net pension expense are based on certain assumptions. Even small changes in those \\nassumptions such as a change in the discount rates or \\nchanged inflation assumptions have a negative or posi-\\ntive effect on funded status and Group equity in the \\ncurrent year, and lead to a change in the periodic net \\npension expense in the following year. The fair value of \\nplan assets is determined to a large degree by develop-\\nments in the capital markets. Unfavourable or favoura-\\nble developments, especially relating to share prices \\nand fixed-interest securities, reduce or increase the \\ncarrying value of plan assets. Risk management for the \\nplan assets takes place through broad diversification of \\ninvestments, the selection of various asset managers \\non the basis of quantitative and qualitative analyses, \\nand the ongoing monitoring of returns and risks. The \\nstructure of pension obligations is taken into considera-\\ntion during the determination of the investment strat -\\negy for the plan assets in order to reduce fluctuations of \\nthe funded status. Risks and opportunities relating to \\npension plans have declined, due mainly to lower vola-\\ntility levels on the capital market.'),\n",

Provisions are recognized for those risks if and \\ninsofar as they are likely to be utilized and the amounts \\nof the obligations can be reasonably estimated.\\nLegal risks \\nRegulatory risks\\nThe automotive industry is subject to extensive govern-\\nmental regulations worldwide. Laws in various jurisdic -\\ntions govern occupant safety and the environmental \\nimpact of vehicles, including emissions levels, fuel \\neconomy and noise, as well as the emissions of the \\nplants where vehicles or parts thereof are produced. \\nFurthermore, regulation, particularly in the European \\nUnion, governs the external reporting on ESG topics \\n(environmental, social or governance topics), whereby \\nthe complexity of such regulation is continuously \\nincreasing. The introduction of certain new regulations \\nmay initially be associated with uncertainties relating to \\ntheir interpretation. In case regulations applicable in \\nthe different regions are not complied with, this could \\nresult in significant penalties, damages claims and rep-\\nutational harm or, in case of regulations applicable to \\nvehicles, the inability to certify vehicles in the relevant \\nmarkets. The cost of compliance with these regulations \\nis considerable, and in this context, Mercedes-Benz \\ncontinues to expect a significant level of costs.Risks from legal proceedings in general\\nMercedes-Benz Group AG and its subsidiaries are con-\\nfronted with various legal proceedings and claims as \\nwell as governmental investigations and orders (legal \\nproceedings) on a large number of topics, including \\nvehicle safety, emissions, fuel economy, financial ser -\\nvices, dealer, supplier and other contractual relation-\\nships, intellectual property rights (especially patent \\ninfringement lawsuits), warranty claims, environmental \\nmatters, antitrust matters (including actions for dam-\\nages) as well as investor litigation. Product-related liti-\\ngation involves among other things claims alleging \\nfaults in vehicles. Some of these claims are asserted by \\nway of class actions. If the outcome of such legal pro-\\nceedings is detrimental to the Mercedes-Benz Group or \\nsuch proceedings are settled, the Group may encounter \\nsubstantial financial burdens, e.g. from damages pay -\\nments or service actions, recall campaigns, monetary \\npenalties or other costly actions. Some of these pro-\\nceedings and related settlements may also have an \\nimpact on the company’s reputation. Risks from legal proceedings in connection with \\ndiesel exhaust-gas emissions — governmental \\nproceedings \\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group is continuously subject to \\ngovernmental information requests, inquiries, investiga-\\ntions, administrative orders and proceedings relating to \\nvarious laws and regulations in connection with diesel \\nexhaust emissions.\\nThe corresponding activities of various authorities \\nworld-wide, which were already reported in the past, \\nare partly ongoing, as described below. These activities \\nparticularly relate to test results, the emission control \\nsystems used in Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles and/or \\nthe interactions of the Mercedes-Benz Group with the \\nrelevant authorities as well as related legal issues and \\nimplications, including, but not limited to, under appli-\\ncable environmental, criminal, consumer protection and \\nantitrust laws.\\nIn the United States, Mercedes-Benz Group AG and \\nMercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA) reached agreements \\nin the third quarter of 2020 with various authorities to \\nsettle civil environmental claims regarding the emission \\ncontrol systems of certain diesel vehicles. These agree-\\nments have become final and effective.

The failure to meet certain of \\nthose obligations may trigger additional stipulated pen-\\nalties. In the first quarter of 2021, the Mercedes-Benz \\nGroup paid the civil penalties.\\nAs already reported, in April 2016, the U.S. Department \\nof Justice (DOJ) requested that the Mercedes-Benz \\nGroup conduct an internal investigation. The Mercedes-\\nBenz Group conducted such an internal investigation in \\ncooperation with the DOJ’s investigation; the DOJ’s \\ninvestigation remains open. In addition, further US state \\nauthorities have opened investigations pursuant to \\nboth local environmental and consumer protection laws \\nand have requested documents and information. \\nIn Canada, the environmental regulator Environment \\nand Climate Change Canada (ECCC) is conducting an \\ninvestigation in connection with Diesel exhaust emis -\\nsions based on the suspicion of potential violations of, \\namongst others, the Canadian Environmental Protection \\nAct as well as potential undisclosed AECDs and defeat \\ndevices. The Mercedes-Benz Group continues to coop-\\nerate with the investigating authorities.\\nIn Germany, the Stuttgart public prosecutor’s office \\nissued a fine notice against Mercedes-Benz in Septem-\\nber 2019 based on a negligent violation of supervisory \\nduties, thereby concluding the related administrative offense proceedings against Mercedes-Benz. In July \\n2021, the local court of Böblingen issued penal orders \\nagainst three Mercedes-Benz employees based on, \\namongst others, fraud, which have become final. The \\ncriminal investigation proceedings of the Stuttgart pub-\\nlic prosecutor’s office against further Mercedes-Benz \\nemployees on the suspicion of, amongst others, fraud \\nhave meanwhile been discontinued. \\nBetween 2018 and 2020, the German Federal Motor \\nTransport Authority (KBA) issued subsequent auxiliary \\nprovisions for the EC type approvals of certain \\nMercedes-Benz diesel vehicles, and ordered mandatory \\nrecalls as well as, in some cases, stops of the first regis -\\ntration. In autumn 2022 and in December 2023, the KBA \\nissued further decisions regarding vehicles equipped \\nwith various EU6 or EU5 diesel engines. In each of \\nthose cases, it held that certain calibrations of speci-\\nfied functionalities are to be qualified as impermissible \\ndefeat devices. Mercedes-Benz has a contrary legal \\nopinion on this question and has filed timely objections \\nagainst the KBA’s administrative orders and determina-\\ntions mentioned above. Insofar as the KBA has not rem-\\nedied the objections, Mercedes-Benz has filed lawsuits \\nwith the competent administrative court to have the \\ncontroversial questions at issue clarified in a court of \\nlaw. Irrespective of such objections and the lawsuits \\nthat are now pending, the Mercedes-Benz Group con-\\ntinues to cooperate fully with the KBA. To a large extent, \\nthe remidial actions requested by the KBA were devel -\\noped by the Mercedes-Benz Group and assessed and \\napproved by the KBA; the necessary recalls were initi-\\nated. For some of the vehicles affected by the KBA’s decision from December 2023, developments, exami-\\nnations and approvals of the remidial measures are still \\npending. It cannot be ruled out that under certain cir -\\ncumstances, software updates may have to be \\nreworked, or further delivery and registration stops may \\nbe ordered or resolved by the company as a precau-\\ntionary measure, also with regard to the used-car, leas -\\ning and financing businesses. In the course of its regular \\nmarket supervision, the KBA routinely conducts further \\nreviews of Mercedes-Benz vehicles and asks questions \\nabout technical elements of the vehicles. In addition, \\nthe Group continues to be in a dialogue with the Ger -\\nman Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV) \\nto conclude the analysis of the diesel-related emissions \\nmatter and to further the update of affected customer \\nvehicles. In light of the aforementioned administrative \\norders issued by the KBA, and continued discussions \\nwith the KBA and the BMDV, it cannot be ruled out \\ncompletely that additional administrative orders may be \\nissued in the course of the ongoing and/or further \\ninvestigations. Since 1 September 2020, this also \\napplies to responsible authorities of other member \\nstates and the European Commission, which conduct \\nmarket surveillance under the new European Type \\nApproval Regulation and can take measures upon \\nassumed non-compliance, irrespective of the place of \\nthe original type approval, and also to the British mar -\\nket surveillance authority DVSA (Driver and Vehicle \\nStandards Agency).\\nIn addition to the aforementioned authorities, authori-\\nties of various foreign states, particularly the South \\nKorean Ministry of Environment and the South Korean'),\n",

In \\nthe same context, national antitrust authorities of vari-\\nous countries are also conducting investigations, \\nincluding the South Korean antitrust authority, which \\nhas made certain findings and imposed fines on some \\ncar manufacturers. In February 2024, the criminal pro-\\nceeding in South Korea was concluded.\\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group continues to fully cooperate \\nwith the authorities and institutions. Irrespective of \\nsuch cooperation and in light of the past developments, \\nit is possible that further regulatory, criminal and \\nadministrative investigative and enforcement actions \\nand measures relating to the Mercedes-Benz Group \\nand/or its employees will be taken or administrative \\norders will be issued. Additionally, further delays in \\nobtaining regulatory approvals necessary to introduce \\nnew or recertify existing vehicle models could occur.Regarding the proceedings and processes still in pro-\\ngress, the Mercedes-Benz Group cannot at this time \\nmake any statement to their outcome. In light of the \\nlegal positions taken by U.S. regulatory authorities and \\nthe KBA as well as the South Korean Ministry of Envi-\\nronment, amongst others, it cannot be ruled out that, \\nbesides these authorities, one or more authorities \\nworldwide will reach the conclusion that other passen-\\nger cars and/or vans with the brand name Mercedes-\\nBenz or other brand names of the Mercedes-Benz \\nGroup are equipped with impermissible defeat devices. \\nLikewise, such authorities could take the view that cer -\\ntain functionalities and/or calibrations are not proper \\nand/or were not properly disclosed. It cannot be ruled \\nout that the Mercedes-Benz Group will become subject \\nto, as the case may be, significant additional fines and \\nother sanctions, measures and actions. The occurrence \\nof the aforementioned events in whole or in part could \\ncause significant collateral damage including reputa-\\ntional harm. Further, due to negative allegations or find-\\nings with respect to technical or legal issues by one of \\nthe various governmental agencies, other agencies — or \\nalso plaintiffs — could also adopt such allegations or \\nfindings. Thus, a negative allegation or finding in one \\nproceeding carries the risk of being able to have an \\nadverse effect on other proceedings, also potentially \\nleading to new or expanded investigations or proceed-\\nings, including lawsuits.In addition, the ability of the Mercedes-Benz Group to \\ndefend itself in proceedings could be impaired by con-\\ncluded proceedings and their underlying allegations as \\nwell as by unfavourable results or developments in any \\nof the information requests, inquiries, investigations, \\nadministrative or criminal orders, legal actions and/or \\nproceedings discussed above.'),\n",

The decision is final, and the \\nproceedings are concluded.\\nConsumer class actions were filed against Mercedes-\\nBenz Group AG in Israel in February 2019 as well as \\nagainst Mercedes-Benz Group AG and further Group \\ncompanies in the United Kingdom since May 2020, in \\nthe Netherlands, in Portugal as well as since November \\n2022 in Australia. The plaintiffs inter alia assert that the \\nMercedes-Benz Group had used devices that impermis -\\nsibly impair the effectiveness of emission control sys -\\ntems in reducing nitrogen oxide (NO X) emissions and \\nwhich cause excessive emissions from vehicles with \\ndiesel engines. Furthermore, they claim that Mercedes-\\nBenz Group AG deceived consumers in connection with \\nadvertising in relation of Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles. \\nThe proceedings in England and Wales consist of sev -\\neral individual lawsuits that have been consolidated \\ninto one class action. A class action lawsuit is also \\npending in Scotland. In these proceedings, allegedly \\ninjured parties must actively register for the enforcement of claims (opt-in). The plaintiffs in the con-\\nsumer class action in England and Wales also allege, \\namongst others, anti-competitive behaviour relating to \\ntechnology for the treatment of diesel exhaust emis -\\nsions.\\nIn Germany, a large number of customers of diesel vehi-\\ncles have filed lawsuits for damages or rescission of \\nsales contracts based on similar allegations. They refer \\nin particular to the KBA’s recall orders mentioned above. \\nAlthough the number of pending lawsuits is declining, a \\nfuture increase cannot be ruled out. Based on similar \\nallegations, the Federation of German Consumer Organ-\\nizations (Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband e.  V.) filed \\na model declaratory action (Musterfeststellungsklage) \\nagainst Mercedes-Benz Group AG with the Stuttgart \\nHigher Regional Court in July 2021. Such an action seeks \\na ruling that certain preconditions of alleged consumer \\nclaims are met. Following a decision of the European \\nCourt of Justice in the first quarter of 2023, the German \\nFederal Court of Justice ruled in the second quarter of \\n2023 that vehicle purchasers are entitled to claim dam-\\nages against the manufacturer if it intentionally or negli-\\ngently used an inadmissible defeat device.’ \\nFurthermore, class actions have been filed in Canada \\nalleging anticompetitive behaviour relating to vehicle \\ntechnology, costs, suppliers, markets and other com-\\npetitive attributes, including diesel emissions control \\ntechnology. In 2022, the proceedings in the United \\nStates were concluded in favour of Mercedes-Benz \\nGroup AG and MBUSA. In addition, in 2023, several \\nclass actions in Canada were finally dismissed as the plaintiffs discontinued their claims. The Mercedes-Benz \\nGroup also expects the last lawsuit pending in Canada \\nto be discontinued and it will continue to defend itself \\nagainst it until the discontinuance is final. This develop-\\nment leads to a material reduction of the risk associ-\\nated with the class actions. They therefore no longer \\nqualify for separate reporting, which is why the \\nMercedes-Benz Group will no longer report on them in \\nthe future.\\nMercedes-Benz Group AG and the respective other \\naffected companies of the Group regard the pending \\nlawsuits set out above as being without merit and con-\\ntinue to defend themselves against them.\\nIn addition, investors from Germany and abroad have \\nfiled lawsuits for damages with the Stuttgart Regional \\nCourt alleging the violation of disclosure requirements \\n(main proceedings) and also raised out-of-court claims \\nfor damages. Mercedes-Benz Group AG regards these \\nlawsuits and out-of-court claims as being without merit \\nand will defend itself against them. In December 2021, \\nthe Stuttgart Higher Regional Court initiated model case \\nproceedings under the German Act on Model Case Pro-\\nceedings in Disputes under Capital Markets Law (Kap-\\nMuG) (model case proceedings).

The following information \\ntherefore relates to the Board of Management of \\nMercedes-Benz Group\\xa0AG, two management levels of \\nMercedes-Benz Group\\xa0AG below its Board of Manage-\\nment, and the Supervisory Board of Mercedes-Benz \\nGroup\\xa0AG.\\nBy resolution of 3 December 2020, the Supervisory \\nBoard of Mercedes-Benz Group\\xa0AG set a target for the \\nproportion of women on the Board of Management of at \\nleast 25% by 31 December 2025. Since August 2022, a \\nlegally mandated minimum participation requirement \\nmust be complied with when appointing members of \\nthe board of management. This requirement stipulates \\nthat at least one woman and at least one man must be \\na member of the board of management in a listed com-\\npany with co-determination and equal representation \\nand more than three members on the board of manage-\\nment. Companies that are subject to the minimum pro-\\nportion requirement are no longer obliged to set a tar -\\nget quota for the proportion of women on the board of \\nmanagement. Nevertheless, within the framework of the overall requirements profile for appointments to the \\nBoard of Management, the Supervisory Board has \\ndecided to go beyond the stipulations of the minimum \\nproportion requirement and maintain the target quota \\nfor the proportion of women on the Board of Manage-\\nment that was set in 2020. As at 31 December 2023, \\nthree of the eight members of the Board of Manage-\\nment are women: Renata Jungo Brüngger, Sabine \\nKohleisen and Britta Seeger. The proportion of women \\non the Board of Management is now 37.5%, which \\nmeans it exceeds the target that was set.\\nBy a resolution dated 25 November 2020, the Board of \\nManagement set a 11.8% share of women at the first \\n(two women of a total of 17 executives) and 22.5% at \\nthe second level of management of Mercedes-Benz \\nGroup\\xa0AG (16 women of a total of 71 executives) below \\nthe Board of Management at the time of the resolution \\nand a target for the proportion of women of at least \\n20% for the first and of at least 25% for the second \\nlevel of the Mercedes-Benz Group AG below the Board \\nof Management by 31 December 2025. As of \\n31 December 2023, the first level of management of \\nMercedes-Benz Group AG below the Board of Manage-\\nment consists of 13 executives, of whom 3 are women, \\ncorresponding to a percentage of women of 23%. At the \\nsecond level of management of Mercedes-Benz \\nGroup\\xa0AG below the Board of Management, as of \\n31 December 2023, 17 out of a total of 50 executives are \\nwomen, corresponding to 34%.\\nThe change in the total number of executives at the var -\\nious management levels of Mercedes-Benz Group\\xa0AG between 25 November 2020 and 31 December 2023 is \\nmainly due to the spin-off and hive-down of the Daimler \\ncommercial vehicles business that has meanwhile been \\ncarried out and the associated transfers to Daimler \\nTruck. \\nBased on the assumption of a total of 13 executives at \\nmanagement level 1 of Mercedes-Benz Group\\xa0AG as of \\n31 December 2025, the set target quota of at least 20% \\nresults in a target of 3 women for this level. Based on \\nthe assumption of a total of 50 executives at manage-\\nment level 2 of Mercedes-Benz Group\\xa0AG as of \\n31 December 2025, the set target quota of 25% results \\nin a target of 13 women for this level.\\nThe supervisory boards of listed companies subject to \\nco-determination and equal representation of share-\\nholders and employees on the supervisory board must \\nbe composed of at least 30% women and at least 30% \\nmen. The quota is to be met by the Supervisory Board \\nas a whole. If the representatives of the shareholders or \\nthe representatives of the employees object to the \\nChairman of the Supervisory Board prior to the election, \\nthen the minimum share for this election shall be ful -\\nfilled separately by the shareholders and the employ -\\nees. At the Supervisory Board meeting on 27 April 2022, \\nthe shareholder representatives objected to the overall \\nfulfilment with regard to the election to the Supervisory \\nBoard of employee representatives whose term of \\noffice began at the end of the Annual General Meeting \\non 3 May 2023.

The Supervisory Board has combined these profiles \\nand concepts in the overall profiles of requirements for \\nthe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board \\ndescribed below. The profiles of requirements are \\nreviewed annually and also serve as a basis for long-\\nterm succession planning.\\nBoard of Management\\nThe objective of the profile of requirements for the \\nBoard of Management is to ensure that the Board of \\nManagement has excellent leadership skills and that its \\ncomposition is as diverse and complementary as possi-\\nble. The Board of Management as a whole shall possess \\nthe knowledge, skills and experience necessary for the \\nproper performance of its duties and at the same time \\nembody the company’s management philosophy on the \\nbasis of the various personal backgrounds and skills of \\nits members. The key factor for the decision on filling a \\nspecific board position is always the interest of the \\ncompany, taking any and all circumstances of the indi-\\nvidual case into account.The profile of requirements for the Board of Manage-\\nment remained the same in the reporting period as in \\nthe previous year and included the following aspects:\\n–  The members of the Board of Management shall have \\ndiverse educational and professional backgrounds, \\npreferably with at least two members with a technical \\nbackground. As of 31 December 2023, the Board of \\nManagement includes two graduate engineers, \\nMarkus Schäfer and Dr Jörg Burzer. Ola Källenius has \\ndemonstrated his technical expertise on a sustained \\nbasis since taking over the Group Research & \\nMercedes-Benz Cars Development department on \\n1 January 2017.\\n–  On 3 December 2020, the Supervisory Board set a \\ntarget for the proportion of women on the Board  \\nof Management of at least 25% by 31 December 2025. \\nIn August 2022, the previous statutory obligation to \\nset a target quota for the proportion of women was \\nreplaced by a statutory minimum participation \\nrequirement of one woman (and one man) for boards \\nof management consisting of more than three per -\\nsons at listed companies with co-determination and \\nequal representation. Nevertheless, within the frame-\\nwork of the overall requirements profile for appoint -\\nments to the Board of Management, the Supervisory \\nBoard has decided to go beyond the stipulations of \\nthe minimum proportion requirement and maintain \\nthe target quota for the proportion of women on the \\nBoard of Management that was set in 2020. As of \\n31 December 2023, three of the eight members of the \\nBoard of Management are women: Renata Jungo'),\n",

The \\nproportion of women on the Board of Management is \\nnow 37.5%, which means it exceeds the target that \\nwas set.\\n–  For the last possible age-related appointment or \\nreappointment of a member of the Board of Manage-\\nment, the completion of the 62nd year of life at the \\ntime of the beginning of a (new) term of office gener -\\nally serves as a guideline. When determining this age \\nlimit, the Supervisory Board deliberately opted for a \\nflexible benchmark in order to preserve the necessary \\nleeway for appropriate decisions in individual cases. \\nWith the exception of Renata Jungo Brüngger, all \\nmembers of the Board of Management fall below this \\nstandard age limit as of 31 December 2023. \\n–  In addition, attention shall be paid to a sufficient \\ngenerational mix among the members of the Board \\nof Management; if possible, at least three members of \\nthe Board of Management shall be 57 years of age or \\nyounger at the beginning of the relevant term of \\noffice. As of 31 December 2023, this applies to, \\namong others, Ola Källenius, Britta Seeger and Dr Jörg \\nBurzer. \\n–  In the composition of the Board of Management, \\nattention shall also be paid to internationality in the \\nsense of different cultural backgrounds or interna-\\ntional experience through several years of stays \\nabroad; if possible, at least one member of the Board \\nof Management shall be of international origin. Not -\\nwithstanding the many years of international experience of the vast majority of the members of the \\nBoard of Management, this goal had already been \\nachieved by 31 December 2023, simply because of \\nthe international origins of Ola Källenius and Renata \\nJungo Brüngger and the focus of Hubertus Troska’s \\nactivities in China.\\n–  As a rule, and subject to disclosure of a deviation in \\nthe annual Declaration of Compliance with the Ger -\\nman Corporate Governance Code, members of the \\nBoard of Management shall not hold more than two \\nmandates on supervisory boards in non-Group \\nlisted companies or comparable functions and \\nshall not chair a supervisory board of a non-Group \\nlisted company. For the purpose of the profile of \\nrequirements, mandates on supervisory boards in \\njoint ventures, the performance of which is part of the \\ndepartmental responsibility of a member of the Board \\nof Management, are not considered to be comparable \\nfunctions.\\n  Of the non-Group memberships of Supervisory \\nBoards and other supervisory bodies held by Huber -\\ntus Troska, only BAIC Motor Corporation Ltd. is listed \\non the stock exchange. With the exception of the \\nmandate at Beijing Foton Daimler Automo-\\ntive Co., Ltd., his other mandates outside the Group \\nare mandates in non-listed joint ventures within his \\ndepartmental responsibility. In the opinion of the \\nSupervisory Board, these mandates, as well as the \\nmandate at Beijing Foton Daimler Automo-\\ntive Co., Ltd., which is part of the Daimler Truck Group, \\ndo not pose any requirements comparable to mandates on supervisory boards of listed companies \\noutside the Group in terms of the requirements pro-\\nfile. The same applies to the non-Group mandates of \\nMarkus Schäfer.\\n  Of the non-Group memberships of supervisory \\nboards and other supervisory bodies held by Britta \\nSeeger, only Deutsche Lufthansa\\xa0AG is listed on the \\nstock exchange. In the opinion of the Supervisory \\nBoard, the other mandates outside the Group are \\nmandates within the scope of her departmental \\nresponsibilities that, in terms of the profile of require-\\nments, do not pose any demands comparable to a \\nmandate on the supervisory board of a listed com-\\npany outside the Group. \\n  Renata Jungo Brüngger is a member of the Supervi-\\nsory Board of the listed company Münchener \\nRückversicherungs-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft \\nand Harald Wilhelm is a member of the Supervisory \\nBoard of BAIC Motor Corporation Ltd, which is also \\nlisted on the stock exchange. In addition, both are \\nrepresented on the Supervisory Board of the non-\\ngroup listed Daimler Truck Holding AG as well as on \\nthe Supervisory Board of the non-listed Daimler \\nTruck AG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Daimler Truck \\nHolding AG. The shareholder representatives on the \\nSupervisory Boards of Daimler Truck Holding\\xa0AG and \\nDaimler Truck\\xa0AG are identical. Against this back -\\nground, in the opinion of the Supervisory Board, \\nmembership of the Supervisory Board of Daimler \\nTruck\\xa0AG does not impose any additional require-\\nments comparable to the mandate at Daimler Truck'),\n",

The Presidential Committee draws up a \\nshort-list of available candidates on the basis of a tar -\\nget profile, taking into account the specific qualification \\nrequirements and the requirements profile. It conducts \\ninterviews with these candidates, and it then submits a \\ncandidate proposal to the Supervisory Board together \\nwith the reasons for its recommendation for the deci-\\nsion-making. The decisive factor is always the interest \\nof the company, in consideration of any and all circum-\\nstances of the individual case. \\nIn the view of the Supervisory Board, fundamental indi-\\nvidual suitability criteria for a position on the Board of \\nManagement are, in particular, personality, integrity, \\nconvincing leadership qualities, professional qualifica-\\ntions for the division to be taken over, past perfor -\\nmance, knowledge of the company, and the ability to \\nadapt business models and processes in a changing \\nworld.Together with the Board of Management, the Supervi-\\nsory Board also ensures long-term succession planning \\nfor the Board of Management, with due consideration of \\nthe profile of requirements and the circumstances of \\nthe individual case. The Presidential Committee of the \\nSupervisory Board regularly discusses talents and \\nexceptional leaders of the company. The contract terms \\nand renewal options of current members of the Board \\nof Management are discussed, as well as possible suc -\\ncessors. On the basis of a potential analysis and in con-\\nsideration of the criteria of the profile of requirements, \\nexecutives from the management level below the Board \\nof Management as well as special high potentials are \\nassessed and the next development steps are dis -\\ncussed and determined together with the Board of \\nManagement. The process of succession planning also \\nincludes regular reporting by the Board of Management \\non the proportion and development of female manag -\\ners, especially at the first and second management lev -\\nels below the Board of Management. The Board of Man-\\nagement is responsible for proposing a sufficient \\nnumber of suitable candidates to the Supervisory Board. \\nMercedes-Benz Group\\xa0AG aims to predominantly fill \\npositions on the Board of Management with managers \\ndeveloped within the company. Nevertheless, potential \\nexternal candidates are also evaluated and included in \\nthe selection process on a case-by-case basis, with the \\nsupport of external recruitment consultancy firms. \\nSupervisory Board\\nThe Supervisory Board as a whole must be familiar with \\nthe industry in which the company operates.The aim of the profile of requirements for the Supervi-\\nsory Board in its entirety is also to ensure that the com-\\nposition of the Supervisory Board is as diverse and \\ncomplementary as possible. The Supervisory Board \\nshall, as a whole, understand the business model of the \\ncompany and possess the knowledge, skills and experi-\\nence — including expertise on the sustainability issues \\nthat are important for the company — necessary to \\nproperly provide qualified supervision and advice to the \\nBoard of Management. \\nOverall, the members of the Supervisory Board shall \\ncomplement one another in terms of their expertise and \\nprofessional experience in such a way that the Board as \\na whole can draw on the broadest possible pool of \\nexperience and diverse specialist knowledge. Further -\\nmore, the Supervisory Board considers the diversity of \\nits members in terms of age, gender, internationality \\nand other personal characteristics as an important pre-\\nrequisite for an effective working relationship. The deci-\\nsion of the Supervisory Board on an election proposal \\nto the General Meeting shall always be based on the \\ninterests of the company, taking any and all circum-\\nstances of the individual case into account.\\nThe profile of requirements for the Supervisory Board \\nincludes the following aspects:\\n–  Standard limit of membership duration \\nAs a rule, only candidates who have not already been \\nmembers of the Supervisory Board for 12 years at the \\ntime of their (re-)election shall be proposed for elec -\\ntion to the Supervisory Board for a full term of office.'),\n",

The quota is to be met by \\nthe Supervisory Board as a whole, unless the repre-\\nsentatives of the shareholders or the representa-\\ntives of the employees object to the overall fulfil -\\nment. If such an objection is made, then the \\nminimum proportion for the next election in the \\ngiven case is to be fulfilled separately by the share-\\nholder side and the employee side. As of \\n31 December 2023, there are three women on both \\nthe side of the shareholders and the side of the \\nemployees.

Dr Bernd Pis -\\nchetsrieder, Ben van Beurden, Dr Martin Bruder -\\nmüller, Liz Centoni, Stefan Pierer, Prof. Dr Helene \\nSvahn, Dr Frank Weber and Roman Zitzelsberger \\nhave university degrees in mechanical engineering, \\nchemistry, business and energy management, bio-\\ntechnology and/or electrical engineering.

The assessment of independence is incum-\\nbent on the shareholder representatives on the \\nSupervisory Board themselves. In this respect, four \\nindicators must be taken into account that may \\npoint to a lack of independence: membership of the \\nBoard of Management within the last two years \\nprior to the appointment as a member of the Super -\\nvisory Board; a significant business relationship \\nwith the company or a company dependent on it, \\ne.g. as a customer, supplier, lender or consultant; a \\nclose family relationship to a member of the Board \\nof Management; membership of the Supervisory \\nBoard for more than twelve years (all criteria relate \\nto both the members of the Supervisory Board and \\ntheir close family members). However, the share-\\nholder side is expressly at liberty to regard the \\nmember of the Supervisory Board in question as \\nindependent if one or even several negative indica-\\ntors are fulfilled — however, this assessment \\nshould then be substantiated in the Declaration on \\nCorporate Governance.\\n   On the basis of the information known to the \\nSupervisory Board, the shareholder representatives \\nare of the opinion that there are no specific indica-\\ntions of relevant personal or business relationships \\nor circumstances, in particular with regard to the company, members of the Board of Management or \\nother members of the Supervisory Board, that could \\nconstitute a material and not merely temporary \\nconflict of interests and therefore argue against the \\nindependence of any member of the Supervisory \\nBoard on the shareholder side. During the reporting \\nperiod, the shareholder representatives Dr Martin \\nBrudermüller, Liz Centoni, and Timotheus Höttges \\nin particular did not have any such material busi-\\nness relationship with Mercedes-Benz Group\\xa0AG or \\nany company dependent on Mercedes-Benz \\nGroup\\xa0AG (e.g. as a supplier, customer, lender or \\nconsultant) in a responsible function of a company \\noutside the Group. The same applies - also in view \\nof the information provided in the chapter Consoli-\\ndated Financial Statements in the note Related \\nparty disclosures - to Stefan Pierer in his role as a \\nshareholder and board member of companies in the \\nPierer and Leoni Groups. No former member of the \\nBoard of Management was a member of the Super -\\nvisory Board during the reporting period. No mem-\\nber of the Supervisory Board holds board functions \\nor performs advisory tasks for significant competi-\\ntors. \\n   No other mandates formerly held by Dr Bernd Pis -\\nchetsrieder could be seen during the reporting \\nperiod as constituting a material and not merely \\ntemporary conflict of interest.\\n   As a result, according to the assessment of the \\nshareholders’ side, at 31 December 2023, all share-\\nholder representatives on the Supervisory Board were to be deemed independent, namely Dr Bernd \\nPischetsrieder, Ben van Beurden, Dr Martin Bruder -\\nmüller, Liz Centoni, Dame Polly Courtice, Marco \\nGobbetti, Timotheus Höttges, Olaf Koch, Stefan \\nPierer and Professor Dr Helene Svahn.\\n –  Standard age limit: As a rule, only candidates who \\nare not older than 72 years at the time of their (re-)\\nelection shall be proposed for election to the \\nSupervisory Board for a full term of office. Upon the \\nestablishment of this age limit, the Supervisory \\nBoard deliberately decided against a rigid maximum \\nage limit and in favour of a flexible standard limit \\nthat preserves the necessary leeway for an appro-\\npriate assessment of the circumstances of the indi-\\nvidual case, that defines the group of potential can-\\ndidates in a sufficiently broad manner, and that also \\nallows for re-election. None of the members of the \\nSupervisory Board in office on 31 December 2023 \\nexceeded the standard age limit at the time of their \\nelection. \\n–  Expertise and experience\\n –  Two finance experts: At least one member of the \\nAudit Committee must have expertise in the field of \\naccounting and at least one other member must \\nhave expertise in the audit of financial statements. \\nExpertise in the field of accounting should involve \\nspecialized knowledge of and experience with the \\nuse of accounting principles and internal control \\nand risk management systems, while expertise in \\nrelation to the audit of financial statements must \\nalso involve specialized knowledge of and'),\n",

Its \\nproduct portfolio is rounded off by a range of financial \\nservices, product -related mobility services and the \\ninstallation of a charging infrastructure. The Group \\ncomprises the segments Mercedes -Benz Cars, Mer-\\ncedes- Benz Vans and Mercedes -Benz Mobility.  \\nMercedes- Benz Group AG is the parent company of the \\nMercedes- Benz Group.  \\nMercedes- Benz Group AG is a stock corporation orga-\\nnized under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germa-\\nny. The Company is entered in the Commercial Register \\nof the Stuttgart District Court under No. HRB 19360 and \\nits registered office is located at Mercedesstraße 120, \\n70372 Stuttgart, Germany.  The Consolidated Financial Statements of Mercedes-\\nBenz Group AG are presented in euros ( €). Unless oth-\\nerwise stated, all amounts are stated in millions of eu-\\nros. All figures shown are rounded.   \\nThe Board of Management of Mercedes -Benz Group AG \\nauthorized the Consolidated Financial Statements for \\npublication on 1 5 March 2024.  \\nBasis of preparation  \\nApplied IFRS  \\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of Mercedes-\\nBenz Group AG and its subsidiaries (“Mercedes -Benz \\nGroup” or “the Group”) as of 31 December 2023 have \\nbeen prepared in accordance with Section 315e of the \\nGerman Commercial Code (HGB) (Consolidated Finan-\\ncial Statements in accordance with International Finan-\\ncial Reporting Standards) and comply with the Interna-\\ntional Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the form \\nin which they must be applied in the European Union \\n(EU) as of 31 December 2023.  IFRS issued, EU endorsed and adopted in the  \\nreporting period  \\nIn May 2021, the IASB published  Deferred taxes relat-\\ning to assets and liabilities arising from a single \\ntransaction (amendments to IAS 12) . When assets and \\nliabilities are recorded for the first time, under certain \\nconditions deferred taxes previously did not have to be \\nrecognized due to an exception. The amendment to IAS \\n12 has the effect of cancelling this exception, which was \\nimportant for the lessee's accounting of finance  leases \\namong other things. The Mercedes -Benz Group applied \\nthe changes for the first time in the financial year that \\ncommenced on 1 January 2023. There were no effects \\non the profitability, liquidity and capital resources, and \\nfinancial position.  \\nIn December 2021, the OECD published  guidelines for \\na new global minimum tax framework  aimed at curb-\\ning base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) by multina-\\ntional corporations. EU member states unanimously \\nagreed in December 2022 to implement these rules in \\nthe form of a directive (BEPS Pillar 2 regulations). As at \\nthe balance sheet date, this directive was transposed \\ninto German law with the Act to Ensure Global Minimum Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\"),\n",

As part of an analysis of possible \\neffects on the Group, no countries were identified as at \\nthe reporting date from which significant effects are to \\nbe expected with regard to the possible payment of a \\nminimum tax.  \\nTo introduce a mandatory temporary exemption from \\nthe requirements in IAS 12 Income Taxes for the record-\\ning and disclosure of information about deferred tax \\nassets and liabilities, the IASB published  International \\nTax Reform - Pillar 2 Model Rules (Amendments to \\nIAS 12 ) in May 2023. The Mercedes -Benz Group applies \\nthe exception rule according to IAS 12, which stipulates \\nthat no deferred tax assets and liabilities are accounted \\nfor in connection with the income taxes of the second \\npillar (“Pillar 2”) of the OECD .  \\nIn May 2017, the IASB published the standard  IFRS 17 \\nInsurance Contracts . IFRS 17 establishes more trans-\\nparency and comparability with regard to the recogni-\\ntion, measurement, presentation and disclosure  of in-\\nsurance contracts with the insurer. The application of \\nIFRS 17 is mandatory for reporting periods beginning on \\nor after 1 January 2023. The first -time application of \\nIFRS 17 had no impact on the profitability, liquidity and \\ncapital resources and financial position of the Mer-\\ncedes- Benz Group.  In addition, other standards and interpretations were \\npublished which are not expected to have any signifi-\\ncant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\nPresentation  \\nPresentation in the Consolidated Statement of Financial \\nPosition differentiates between current and non -current \\nassets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities are generally \\nclassified as current if they are expected to be realized \\nor settled within one year. Deferred tax assets and lia-\\nbilities as well as assets and provisions for pensions \\nand similar obligations are presented as non -current \\nitems.  \\nThe Consolidated Statement of Income is presented \\nusing the cost -of-sales method.  \\nPrinciples of consolidation  \\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the fi-\\nnancial statements of Mercedes- Benz Group AG and the \\nfinancial statements of all subsidiaries, including struc-\\ntured entities, which are directly or indirectly controlled \\nby Mercedes- Benz Group AG. Control exists if the par-\\nent company has the power of decision over a subsidi-\\nary based on voting rights or other rights, if it partici-\\npates in positive and negative variable returns from a \\nsubsidiary, and if it can affect these returns by its power \\nof decision.  Structured entities are entities which have been de-\\nsigned so that voting or similar rights are not relevant in \\ndeciding who controls the entity. This is the case for \\nexample if voting rights relate to administrative tasks \\nonly and the relevant activities are directed by means of \\ncontractual arrangements.  \\nThe financial statements of consolidated subsidiaries \\nwhich are included in the Consolidated Financial State-\\nments are generally prepared as of the reporting date  \\nof the Consolidated Financial Statements. The financial \\nstatements of Mercedes- Benz Group AG and its compa-\\nnies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements \\nare prepared using uniform recognition and measure-\\nment principles. Intra -Group assets and liabilities, equi-\\nty, income and expenses as well as cash flows from \\ntransactions between consolidated entities are elimi-\\nnated in the course of the consolidation process.  \\nBusiness combinations and changes in equity  \\ninterests \\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the \\npurchase method. In connection with obtaining control, \\nnon- controlling interest in the acquiree is in principle \\nrecognized at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s \\nidentifiable assets, which are measured at fair value.  \\nChanges in equity interests in subsidiaries that reduce \\nor increase the Mercedes- Benz Group’s percentage \\nownership without a change of control are accounted \\nfor as equity transactions between owners.

If realization is not \\npermitted, they are reclassified to retained earnings.  \\nInvestments in associated companies, joint ventures \\nor joint operations   \\nAn associated company is an entity over which the \\nGroup has significant influence. Significant influence is \\nthe power to participate in the financial and operating \\npolicy decisions of the investee. Associated companies \\nare generally accounted for using the equity method.  \\nFor entities over which the Mercedes -Benz Group has \\njoint control together with a partner (joint arrange-\\nments), it is necessary to differentiate between whether \\na joint operation or a joint venture exists. In a joint ven-\\nture, the parties that have joint control of the arrange-\\nment have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. \\nFor joint ventures, the equity method has to be applied. \\nA joint operation exists when the jointly controlling \\nparties have direct rights to the assets and obligations \\nfor the liabilities. In this case, the prorated assets and  \\nliabilities and the prorated income and expenses are \\ngenerally to be recogn ized (proportionate consolida-\\ntion).  If the financial statements of associated companies, \\njoint ventures or joint operations should not be availa-\\nble in good time, the Group’s proportionate share of the \\nresults of operations is included in the Mercedes -Benz \\nGroup’s Consolidated Financial Statements with up to \\nthree -month time lag taking into account significant \\nevents or transactions.   \\nEntities measured at amortized cost  \\nSubsidiaries, associated companies, joint ventures  and \\njoint operations whose business is non -active or of low \\nvolume and that individually and in sum are not material \\nfor the Group and the fair presentation of profitability, \\nliquidity and capital resources, and financial position \\nare generally measured at amortized cost in the Consol-\\nidated Financial Statements.  Foreign currency translation  \\nTransactions in foreign currency are translated at the \\nrelevant foreign exchange- rates prevailing at the trans-\\naction date. In subsequent periods, assets and liabilities \\ndenominated in foreign currency are translated using \\nperiod -end exchange- rates; gains and losses from this \\nmeasurement are recognized in profit and loss (except \\nfor gains and losses resulting from the translation of \\nequity instruments measured at fair value through other \\ncomprehensive income, which are recognized in other \\ncomprehensive income/loss).  \\nAssets and liabilities of foreign companies for which the \\nfunctional currency is not the euro are translated into \\neuros using period- end exchange- rates. The translation \\nadjustments are presented in other comprehensive \\nincome/loss. The components of equity are translated \\nusing historical rates. The statements of income and \\ncash flows are translated into euros using the quarterly \\naverage exchange -rates during the respective periods.  \\nThe exchange- rates providing the basis for the currency \\ntranslation of the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi – \\nthe most significant foreign currencies for the Mer-\\ncedes- Benz Group – developed as shown in the follow-\\ning table.'),\n",

This generally \\noccurs at the time the customer takes possession of \\nthe products.  \\nIf a dealer is not classified as a principal but as an \\nagent and therefore control of vehicles is not trans-\\nferred to him, sales revenue is only recorded when  \\nthe end customer obtains control. The brokerage com-\\nmissions payable to the dealer are shown in selling \\nexpenses.  \\nRevenue recognition from the sale of vehicles for which \\nthe Group enters into a repurchase obligation is de-\\npendent on the form of the repurchase agreement. \\n- Sales of vehicles by which the Mercedes -Benz Group \\nis obliged to repurchase the vehicles in the future  are \\naccounted for as operating  leases. Thi s also applies \\nto a call option  that grants the Mercedes -Benz Group \\nthe right to repurchase.  \\n- Sales of vehicles including a put option (an entity’s \\nobligation to repurchase the asset at the customer’s \\nrequest) are reported as operating leases if the cus-\\ntomer has a significant economic incentive to exer-\\ncise that right at contract inception. Otherwise, a sale with a right of return is reported. The Mercedes -Benz \\nGroup considers several factors when assessing \\nwhether the customer has a significant economic in-\\ncentive to exercise his or her right. Among others, \\nthese are the relation between the agreed repur-\\nchase price and the expected future market value  \\n(at the time of repurchase) of the asset, or historical \\nreturn rates.  \\nArrangements such as when the Mercedes -Benz Group \\nprovides customers with a guaranteed minimum resale \\nvalue that they receive on resale (residual -value guar-\\nantee) do not constrain the customers in their ability to \\ndirect the use of and obtain substantially all of the \\nbenefits from the asset. At contract inception of a sale \\nwith a residual- value guarantee, revenue therefore has \\nto be recognized, reduced by a potential compensation \\npayment to the customer (revenue deferral).  \\nUnder a contract manufacturing agreement, the Mer-\\ncedes- Benz Group sells assets to a third -party manu-\\nfacturer from which the Mercedes -Benz Group buys \\nback the manufactured products after completion of \\nthe commissioned work. If the provision of material is \\nnot associated with the transfer of control to the ser-\\nvice provider, no revenue is recognized. \\nFor certain products sold by the Group, it offers ex-\\ntended, separately priced warranties that go beyond \\nthe statutory period, as well as service and mainte-\\nnance contracts. Usual for such contracts is an advance \\npayment or the payment of constant instalments over  the term of the contract. If the customer has made an \\nadvance payment, the revenue from these contracts is \\ndeferred as a contract liability and recognized as reve-\\nnue over the term of the contract in proportion to the \\ncosts expected to be incurred based on historical in-\\nformation. A future loss on these contracts is recog-\\nnized in the current reporting year if the expected \\ncosts for outstanding services under the contract ex-\\nceed unearned revenue.   \\nFor multiple- element arrangements, such as when ve-\\nhicles are sold with free or reduced -in-price mainte-\\nnance contracts or with free online services, the Group \\ngenerally allocates revenue to the various elements \\nbased on their estimated relative stand -alone selling \\nprices. To determine stand -alone selling prices, the \\nMercedes- Benz Group primarily uses price lists with \\nconsideration of average price reductions granted to its \\ncustomers.  \\nDepending on the sales model, vehicles may be initially \\nsold to non- Group dealers. When control of the vehicle \\nis transferred to the non -Group dealer, the Mercedes -\\nBenz Group recognizes revenue from the sale of the \\nvehicle. Irrespective of this, an end customer can de-\\ncide to enter into a leasing contract with Mercedes -\\nBenz Mobility regarding such a vehicle. The vehicle is \\nthen sold by the non -Group dealer to Mercedes- Benz \\nMobility.'),\n",

All leasing incentives already received from the \\nlessor are deducted.  \\nLease liabilities, which are assigned to financing liabili-\\nties, are measured initially at the present value of the \\nlease payments still to be made. The lease liabilities \\ninclude the following lease payments : \\n- fixed  payments including de facto fixed payments \\nless lease incentives receivables from the lessor;  \\n- variable lease payments linked to an index or interest \\nrate;  \\n- amounts expected to be payable under residual -\\nvalue guarantees; \\n- the exercise price of purchase options, when exer-\\ncise is estimated to be reasonably certain , and \\n- contractual penalties for the termination of a lease if \\nthe lease term reflects the exercise of a termination \\noption.  The Mercedes -Benz Group generally also applies the \\noption for contracts comprising lease components as \\nwell as non -lease components not to split these com-\\nponents.  \\nLease payments are discounted at the rate implicit in \\nthe lease if that rate can readily be determined. Other-\\nwise, discounting is at the incremental borrowing rate. \\nThis incremental borrowing rate as a risk -adjusted in-\\nterest rate is derived on a maturity - and currency spe-\\ncific basis. As the cash flow pattern of the reference \\ninterest rates (bullet bonds) does not correspond to \\nthe cash  flow pattern of a lease contract (annuity), a \\nduration adjustment in order to  account for that differ-\\nence is used . \\nA right -of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost \\nless any accumulated depreciation and, if necessary, \\nany accumulated impairment. If the lease transfers \\nownership of the underlying asset to the lessee at the \\nend of the lease term or if the cost of the right -of-use \\nasset reflects that the lessee will exercise a purchase \\noption, the right -of-use asset is depreciated to the end \\nof the useful life of the underlying asset. Otherwise, the \\nright -of-use asset is depreciated to the end of the \\nlease term. In the subsequent measurement of a lease liability, the \\ncarrying amount is increased to reflect interest on the \\nlease liability and reduced to reflect the lease pay-\\nments made. According to IFRS 16, the depreciation of \\nright -of-use assets is recognized within functional \\ncosts. The interest due on the lease liability is a com-\\nponent of interest expense. Extension and  termination \\noptions are part of a number of leases particularly of \\nreal estate. In determining the lease term, those op-\\ntions are only considered if their exercise is reasonably \\ncertain . During the term, these options are regularly \\nchecked with regard to their probability of being exer-\\ncised.'),\n",

Depending on the region and \\nthe current market situation, the risk -mitigation \\nmeasures taken generally include continuous market \\nmonitoring as well as, if required, price- setting strate-\\ngies or sales- promotion measures designed to regulate \\nvehicle inventories. Market forecasts are verified by \\nregular comparisons of internal and external sources, \\nand, if required, the determination of residual values is \\nadjusted and further developed with regard to meth-\\nods, processes and systems.  \\nIn the case of accounting as an operating  lease, these \\nvehicles are capitalized at the (amortized) cost of pro-\\nduction under equipment  on operating leases  and are \\ndepreciated over the contract term on a straight -line \\nbasis with consideration of the expected residual val-\\nues. Changes in the expected residual values lead ei-\\nther to prospective adjustments of the scheduled de-\\npreciation or, if necessary, to an impairment loss. The \\nvehicles are allocated to the segment which bears sub-\\nstantially all of the residual -value risk.  Operating  leases also relate to vehicles, primarily \\nGroup products that Mercedes- Benz Mobility acquires \\nfrom non -Group dealers or other third parties and \\nleases to end customers. These vehicles are presented \\nat (amortized) cost of acquisition under equipment on \\noperating leases  in the Mercedes- Benz Mobility seg-\\nment. If these vehicles are Group products and are \\nsubsidized and these subsidies are passed on in the \\nlease agreement with the external customer, the subsi-\\ndies are deducted from the acquisition cost. After rev-\\nenue is received from the sale to independent dealers, \\nthese Group products generate revenue from lease \\npayments and subsequent resale on the basis of the \\nseparate leasing contracts.  \\nIn the case of finance  leases , the Group presents the \\nreceivables under receivables from financial services in \\nan amount corresponding to the net investment of the \\nlease agreements. The net investment of a lease \\nagreement is the gross investment (future lease pay-\\nments and non- guaranteed residual value) discounted \\nat the rate upon which the lease agreement is based. \\nMercedes- Benz Mobility continues the leasing and \\nsales -financing business for Daimler Truck’s commer-\\ncial vehicles in some markets. To this end, Mercedes-\\nBenz Mobility acquires these vehicles from Daimler \\nTruck and leases them to the end customers.

The leases that were \\nconcluded before the legal spin- off and hive -down are \\ncontinued as operating  leases. The head lease is pre-\\nsented under equipment  on operating leases  as a right \\nof use, which was recognized at fair value at the spin-\\noff date and subsequently depreciated on a straight -\\nline basis. In addition, a residual -value receivable from \\nthe companies of the Daimler Truck Group is recog-\\nnized. However, the leasing contracts concluded after \\nthe legal spin -off and hive -down are classified and \\naccounted for as finance  leases. The net investment in \\nthe lease corresponds to the right- of-use asset from \\nthe head lease. In addition to the finance  lease, Mer-\\ncedes- Benz Mobility recognizes a residual- value re-\\nceivable from the Daimler Truck Group in the amount \\nof the guaranteed residual value. The head lease is not \\nrecorded separately.  Impairment of non -current non -financial assets  \\nThe Mercedes -Benz Group assesses at each reporting \\ndate whether there is an indication that an asset may \\nbe impaired or whether there is an indication that a \\npreviously recognized impairment loss may be re-\\nversed. If such indication exists, the Mercedes- Benz \\nGroup estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. \\nThe recoverable amount is determined for each indi-\\nvidual asset unless the asset generates cash inflows \\nthat are not largely independent of those from other \\nassets or other groups of assets (cash -generating \\nunits).  \\nAn assessment is made at each reporting date as to \\nwhether there is any indication that previously recog-\\nnized impairment losses may no longer exist or may be \\nreversed. If this is the case, the Mercedes- Benz Group  \\nrecords a partial or entire reversal of the impairment; \\nthe carrying amount is thereby increased to the recov-\\nerable amount. However, the increased carrying \\namount may not exceed the carrying amount that \\nwould have been determined (net of scheduled depre-\\nciation) if no impairment loss had been recognized in \\nprior years.  \\nGoodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite \\nuseful lives are tested at least annually for impairment. \\nThis takes place at the level of the cash- generating \\nunits. The cash -generating units Mercedes -Benz Cars \\nand Mercedes- Benz Vans basically correspond to the \\nsegments. At Mercedes -Benz Mobility, impairment testing is carried out below segment level. A distinction \\nis made between the two cash- generating units Mer-\\ncedes- Benz Mobility Classic (traditional financial ser-\\nvices business) and Charging Solutions (development \\nof a high -power charging network). As the Charging \\nSolutions cash -generating unit had neither goodwill nor \\nother intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in \\n2023 and there was no indication of impairment in \\n2023, it was not necessary to calculate the recoverable \\namount.  \\nIf it is determined that the carrying amount of an asset \\nor of a cash -generating unit exceeds the recoverable \\namount, an impairment loss is recognized for the dif-\\nference.  \\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less \\ncosts of disposal and value in use. For cash -generating \\nunits, the Mercedes- Benz Group in a first step deter-\\nmines the respective recoverable amount as value in \\nuse and compares it with the respective carrying \\namount (including goodwill). If value in use is lower \\nthan the carrying amount, fair value less costs of dis-\\nposal is additionally calculated to determine the recov-\\nerable amount.\"),\n",

This planning, which covers the period up \\nto and including 2028, is based on assumptions, in-\\ncluding those regarding future sales volumes, the gen-\\neral development of the respective markets and the \\nprofitability of the products, taking into account the \\neffects of the transformation of the automotive indus-\\ntry and the expected macroeconomic developments.  \\nIn the detailed planning period, an overall moderate \\nincrease in unit sales and revenue is assumed for the \\ncash- generating units Mercedes -Benz Cars and Mer-\\ncedes- Benz Vans, with a significant increase in the \\nproportion of electric vehicles. Based on the sales \\nplanning of the cash -generating units Mercedes -Benz \\nCars and Mercedes- Benz Vans, the planning of the \\ncash- generating unit Mercedes -Benz Mobility Classic \\nassumes an increase in the portfolio in the detailed \\nplanning period. The assumptions used for planning are \\nchecked for plausibility both against historical devel-\\nopments and against external sources of information \\n(e.g. market studies). The rounded, risk -adjusted inter-\\nest rates determined specifically for the respective \\ncash- generating unit and used to discount the cash \\nflows are 9.5% (2022: 9%) after taxes for the Mer-\\ncedes- Benz Cars and Mercedes -Benz Vans cash -\\ngenerating units. A risk -adjusted interest rate of 10% \\n(2022: 10%) after taxes is used for the Mercedes -Benz Mobility Classic cash -generating unit. While the dis-\\ncount rate for the Mercedes -Benz Mobility Classic \\ncash- generating unit represents the cost of equity, the \\nrisk- adjusted interest rate for the Mercedes -Benz Cars \\nand Mercedes- Benz Vans cash -generating units is \\nbased on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). \\nThis is calculated based on the capital asset pricing \\nmodel (CAPM), taking into account current market ex-\\npectations. In calculating the risk -adjusted interest rate \\nfor impairment -test purposes, specific peer group in-\\nformation is used for beta factors, capital -structure \\ndata and cost of debt. Periods not covered by the fore-\\ncast are taken into account by recognizing a residual \\nvalue (terminal value), which does not include any \\ngrowth rates. When deriving the terminal value, as-\\nsumptions regarding the effects of the transformation \\nof the automotive industry are also taken into account, \\nanalogous to the detailed planning period. When deriv-\\ning the value in use, a risk assessment is also carried \\nout for both the detailed planning period and the ter-\\nminal value, which includes, for example, market risks \\nas well as risks resulting from legal and political \\nframework conditions (e.g. in connection with sustaina-\\nbility aspects). This risk assessment shows for the rele-\\nvant cash- generating units that even in the case of \\nreasonably possible changes in operational key as-\\nsumptions (e.g. profitability of the products, unit sales \\nand portfolio) compared to the original planning, no \\nneed for impairment exists. While the recoverable \\namount of the Mercedes -Benz Cars and Mercedes -\\nBenz Vans cash -generating units significantly exceeds \\nthe carrying amount, the recoverable amount of the Mercedes- Benz Mobility Classic cash -generating unit is \\nclose to the carrying amount. In addition, sensitivity \\nanalyses are carried out (e.g. with regard to the dis-\\ncount rate). The carrying amount of the Mercedes -Benz \\nMobility Classic cash -generating unit would exceed the \\nrecoverable amount if, in addition to a change in opera-\\ntional key assumptions, the cost of equity were to in-\\ncrease slightly.'),\n",

The goodwill is included in the carrying \\namount of the equity -method investment. If an equity \\ninterest in an existing associated company is increased \\nwithout change in significant influence, goodwill is \\ndetermined only for the additionally acquired interest; \\nthe previous investment is not remeasured at fair val-\\nue.  \\nThe Mercedes -Benz Group  reviews on each reporting \\ndate whether there is any objective indication of im-\\npairments or impairment reversals of equity -method \\ninvestments. If such indications exist, the Group de-\\ntermines the impairment loss or reversal to be recog-\\nnized. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable \\namount of an investment, the carrying amount is writ-\\nten down to the recoverable amount. The recoverable \\namount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and \\nvalue in use. An impairment reversal is carried out if there is objective evidence for an impairment reversal. \\nIf such an assessment is made, the recoverable amount \\nis remeasured. An impairment reversal is recognized to \\nthe extent that the recoverable amount has increased \\nsubsequent to the impairment and is limited to the \\namount by which an asset has been impaired. \\nGains or losses to be eliminated from transactions with \\ncompanies accounted for using the equity method are \\nrecognized through profit and loss with corresponding \\nadjustments of the investments’ carrying amounts. \\nGains or losses from the contribution of interests in \\nsubsidiaries to investments which are measured using \\nthe equity method are also subject to elimination ad-\\njustments to the carrying amount of the investment.

In this \\ncase, the assets or disposal groups are no longer de-\\npreciated as planned, but are measured at the lower of \\ncarrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Imme-\\ndiately before classification as held for sale, it is as-\\nsessed if the assets are impaired based on the applica-\\nble individual regulations. If fair value less costs to sell \\nsubsequently increases, any impairment loss previously \\nrecognized is reversed. This reversal is restricted to the \\nimpairment loss previously recognized for the assets or \\ndisposal group concerned.  \\nInventories  \\nInventories are measured at the lower of acquisition or \\nmanufacturing cost and net realizable value. The net \\nrealizable value is the expected sales price less esti-\\nmated costs of completion and estimated costs to sell. \\nThe acquisition or manufacturing costs of inventories \\nare generally based on the specific identification meth-\\nod and include costs incurred in acquiring the invento-\\nries and bringing them to their present location and \\ncondition.

Financial instru-\\nments in the form of financial assets and financial lia-\\nbilities are generally presented separately. Financial \\ninstruments are recognized as soon as the Mercedes -\\nBenz Group becomes a party to the contractual provi-\\nsions of the financial instrument. In the case of pur-\\nchases or sales of financial assets through the regular \\nmarket, the Mercedes- Benz Group uses the transaction \\ndate as the date of initial recognition or derecognition.  \\nUpon initial recognition, financial instruments are \\nmeasured at fair value. For the purpose of subsequent \\nmeasurement, financial instruments are allocated to \\none of the categories mentioned in IFRS 9 Financial \\nInstruments (financial assets measured at amortized \\ncost, financial assets measured at fair value through \\nother comprehensive income and financial assets \\nmeasured at fair value through profit or loss). Transac-\\ntion costs directly attributable to acquisition or issu-\\nance are considered when determining the carrying \\namount if the financial instruments are not measured at \\nfair value through profit or loss.  Financial assets  \\nFinancial assets primarily comprise receivables from \\nfinancial services, trade receivables, receivables from \\nbanks, cash on hand, derivative financial assets, mar-\\nketable securities and similar investments and financial \\ninvestments.  \\nThe classification of financial instruments is based on \\nthe business model in which these instruments are \\nheld and on their contractual cash flows.  \\nThe determination of the business model is carried out \\nat the portfolio level and is based on management’s \\nintention and past transaction patterns.

Upon the \\ndisposal of debt instruments, the accumulated gains \\nand losses recognized in other comprehensive in-\\ncome/loss resulting from measurement at fair value are \\nrecognized in profit or loss. Interest earned on financial \\nassets at fair value through other comprehensive in-\\ncome is generally reported as interest income using the \\neffective -interest method. Changes in the fair value of \\nequity instruments measured at fair value through oth-\\ner comprehensive income are not recycled to profit or \\nloss, but reclassified to retained earnings upon dispos-\\nal. Dividends are recognized in profit or loss when the \\nright to payment has been established.  Financial assets at amortized cost  \\nFinancial assets at amortiz ed cost are non- derivative \\nfinancial assets with contractual cash flows that consist \\nsolely of payments of principal and interest on the \\nnominal amount outstanding and which are held with \\nthe aim of collecting the contractual cash flows, such \\nas receivables from financial services, trade receiva-\\nbles or cash and cash equivalents (business model \\n“hold to collect”). After initial recognition, these finan-\\ncial assets at amortized cost are subseq uently carried \\nat amortized cost using the effective -interest method \\nless any loss allowances. Gains and losses are recog-\\nnized in the Consolidated Statement of Income  when  \\nthe financial assets at amortiz ed cost are impaired or \\nderecognized. Interest effect s from the application of \\nthe effective -interest method are also recognized in \\nprofit or loss as well as effects from foreign currency \\ntranslation.  \\nCash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on \\nhand, cheques and demand deposits at banks, as well \\nas debt instruments and certificates of deposits with a \\nremaining term when acquired of up to three months, \\nwhich are not subject to any material value fluctua-\\ntions.

The expected credit \\nloss is recognized as an impairment measured over the \\nexpected lifetime of the financial asset. Objective evi-\\ndence for a credit -impaired financial asset includes 91 \\ndays past due date and other information about signifi-\\ncant financial difficulties of the debtor.  \\nThe determination of whether a financial asset has \\nexperienced a significant increase in credit risk is \\nbased on an assessment of the probability of default, \\nwhich is made at least quarterly, incorporating external \\ncredit rating information as well as internal information \\non the credit quality of the financial asset. For debt \\ninstruments that are not receivables from financial \\nservices, a significant increase in credit risk is assessed \\nmainly based on past -due information or the probabil-\\nity of default.   \\nA financial asset is migrated to stage 2 if the asset’s \\ncredit risk has increased significantly compared to its \\ncredit risk at initial recognition. The credit risk is as-\\nsessed based on the probability of default. For trade \\nreceivables, the simplified approach is applied whereby \\nall trade receivables are allocated to stage 2 initially. \\nHence, no determination of significant increases in \\ncredit risk is necessary.  The Mercedes -Benz Group applies the low -credit -risk \\nexception to the stage allocation to quoted debt in-\\nstruments with investment -grade ratings. These debt \\ninstruments are always allocated to stage 1.  \\nIn stages  1 and 2, the effective interest revenue is cal-\\nculated based on gross carrying amounts. If a financial \\nasset becomes credit impaired in stage 3, the effective \\ninterest revenue is calculated based on its net carrying \\namount (gross carrying amount adjusted for any loss \\nallowance).  Measurement of expected credit losses  \\nExpected credit losses are measured in a way that \\nreflects:  \\na) the unbiased and probability -weighted amount;  \\nb) the time value of money;  \\nc) reasonable and supportable information (if availa-\\nble without undue cost or effort) at the reporting \\ndate about past events, current conditions and \\nforecasts of future economic conditions. \\nExpected credit losses are measured as the probabil-\\nity-weighted present value of all cash shortfalls over \\nthe expected life of each financial asset. For receiva-\\nbles from financial services, expected credit losses are \\ncalculated using a statistical model with three major \\nrisk parameters: probability of default, loss given de-\\nfault and exposure at default.  \\nThe estimation of these risk parameters incorporates \\nall available relevant information, not only historical \\nand current loss data, but also reasonable and sup-\\nportable forward -looking information reflected by fu-\\nture expectations. This information includes macroeco-\\nnomic factors (e.g. gross domestic product growth, \\nunemployment rate, cost performance index) and fore-\\ncasts of future economic conditions. For receivables \\nfrom financial services, these forecasts are performed \\nusing a scenario analysis (basic scenario, optimistic'),\n",

However, \\nembedded derivatives are not separated from the host \\ncontract if that host contract is a financial asset, if the \\nMercedes- Benz Group chooses to measure a hybrid \\ncontract at fair value through profit or loss, or if the \\nembedded derivative is closely related to the host \\ncontract.  \\nDerivative financial instruments are measured at fair \\nvalue upon initial recognition and at each subsequent \\nreporting date. The fair value of listed derivatives is \\nequal to their positive or negative market value. If a \\nmarket value is not available, fair value is calculated \\nusing standard financial valuation models such as dis-\\ncounted cash flow or option -pricing models. Deriva-\\ntives are recognized as assets if their fair value is posi-\\ntive and as liabilities if their fair value is negative.  \\nIf the requirements for hedge accounting set out in \\nIFRS 9 are met, the Mercedes -Benz Group designates and documents the hedge relationship from the date a \\nderivative contract is entered into as a fair -value \\nhedge, a cash  flow hedge or a hedge of a net invest-\\nment in a foreign business operation. In a fair -value \\nhedge, the changes in the fair value of a recognized \\nasset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment \\nare hedged. In a cash  flow hedge, highly probable fu-\\nture cash flows from expected transactions or variable \\ncash flows to be paid or received related to a recog-\\nnized asset or liability are hedged. The documentation \\nof the hedging relationship includes the objectives and \\nstrategy of risk management, the type of hedging rela-\\ntionship, the nature of the risk being hedged, the iden-\\ntification of the eligible hedging instrument and the \\neligible hedged item, as well as an assessment of the \\neffectiveness requirements comprising the risk mitigat-\\ning economic relationship, the absence of deteriorating \\neffects from credit risk and the appropriate hedge ra-\\ntio. The effectiveness of the hedge is assessed at the \\nstart of and during the hedging relationship.  \\nChanges in fair value of non -designated derivatives are \\nrecognized in profit or loss. For fair -value hedges, \\nchanges in the fair value of derivative financial instru-\\nments and the hedged item are recognized in profit or \\nloss. For cash  flow hedges, fair -value changes in the \\neffective portion of derivative financial instruments are \\nrecognized after tax in other comprehensive income.  \\nEffects from hedging are presented in the item of the \\nStatement of Income in which the underlying transac-\\ntion is effective. Under IFRS 9, for cash  flow hedges in procurement \\ntransactions expected with a high degree of probabil-\\nity, designation can be made for separable risk compo-\\nnents of these non -financial hedged items.  \\nUnder IFRS 9, with cash  flow hedges, amounts recog-\\nnized in other comprehensive income as effective \\nhedging gains or losses from hedging instruments are \\nremoved from the reserves for derivative financial in-\\nstruments and directly included in the initial cost or \\ncarrying amount of the hedged item at initial recogni-\\ntion if the hedged item, e.g. the forecast transaction, \\nresults in the recognition of a non -financial asset or \\nnon- financial liability.  \\nFor other cash  flow hedges, the accumulated hedging \\ngains or losses from hedging instruments are reclassi-\\nfied from the reserves for derivative financial instru-\\nments to the Consolidated Statement of Income when \\nthe hedged item affects profit or loss. Insofar as cur-\\nrency translation effects recognized in profit or loss \\ndue to trade receivables and payables are connected \\nwith the underlying hedged transactions, simultaneous-\\nly occurring hedging gains/losses are reclassified in the \\nConsolidated Statement of Income.  \\nThe ineffective portions of fair -value changes are rec-\\nognized directly in profit or loss.  \\nFor derivative instruments designated in a hedge rela-\\ntionship, certain components can be excluded from \\ndesignation and the changes in these components’ fair'),\n",

The other expenses resulting from pension \\ncommitments and other post -employment benefit obli-\\ngations, which mainly result from entitlements acquired \\nduring the year under review, are taken into considera-\\ntion in functional costs in the Consolidated Statement \\nof Income. Differences between the assumptions made \\nand actual developments as well as changes in actuari-\\nal assumptions for the measurement of defined benefit \\nplans and similar obligations result in actuarial gains \\nand losses, which are recognized in equity through \\nother comprehensive income. The discount factors used to calculate the present \\nvalues of defined benefit pension obligations are to be \\ndetermined  – with maturities and currencies matching \\nthe pension payments  – by reference to market yields \\nat the end of the reporting period on high -quality fixed -\\nrate corporate bonds in the respective markets. For \\nvery long maturities, there are no high -quality corpo-\\nrate bonds available as a benchmark.

When determining \\nrecoverability, the expected residual value of the \\nleased vehicles is particularly relevant. Due to the \\ntransformation to all -electric vehicles, residual values \\ncan be influenced by changing customer behavior, new \\nregulatory requirements and further technological de-\\nvelopments. Although the currently expected residual \\nvalues of all -electric vehicles were lower than originally \\nexpected, no significant impairment losses were re-\\nquired for conventionally powered or all -electric vehi-\\ncles in the reporting year.  \\nThe expected proceeds from the disposal of vehicles \\npledged as collateral were taken into account in the \\ndetermination of expected credit losses for receivables \\nfrom financial services. The expected proceeds from \\nthe disposal were based on an estimate of the market \\nvalue at the expected time of a possible default. There \\nwere no indications of a reduction of these estimated \\nmarket values that could be traced to effects of climate \\nchange or of changing customer behaviour as of the \\nreporting date.   \\nIn addition to traditional energy supply contracts, \\nwhich are usually only recorded as pending transac-\\ntions upon delivery, the Group has concluded contracts \\nto secure purchase quantities and prices for renewable \\nenergies (in particular electricity from wind and solar \\nenergy). These are contracts that provide for a fixed \\nremuneration per unit of energy and are mainly recog-\\nnized either as derivatives or leases.  The impairment test on the level of the cash -generating \\nunits is based on the corporate planning and strategy \\nof the Mercedes- Benz Group. This provides for a step \\nby step substitution of vehicles with combustion en-\\ngines by electric vehicles.  \\nFor the purposes of the impairment test, further risks \\n(e.g. sales risks, price risks and risks regarding the fu-\\nture price of raw materials) were also taken into ac-\\ncount. Additional corporate planning parameters in \\nconnection with the transformation affect the invest-\\nment requirements and the currently higher variable \\ncosts of all -electric vehicles in comparison with vehi-\\ncles with conventional powertrains. The simultaneous \\ndevelopment, model refinement and production of \\nelectric and conventionally powered vehicles results in \\na high investment requirement, particularly in the detail \\nplanning period until 2028. No growth was assumed in \\nthe derivation of the terminal value, due in part to the \\nnot yet completely predictable effects of the competi-\\ntive situation and customer behaviour in the course of \\nthe transition to electric mobility. The impairment test \\ncarried out taking into account the transformation ef-\\nfects described did not result in any impairment re-\\nquirement for the cash -generating units .'),\n",

Accounting estimates and  \\nmanagement judge ments  \\nIn the Consolidated Financial Statements, it is to a \\ncertain degree necessary to make estimates and man-\\nagement judgements which can affect the amounts and \\nreporting of assets and liabilities, the reporting of con-\\ntingent assets and liabilities on the balance sheet date, \\nand the income and expense reported for the period. \\nThe major items affected by such estimates and man-\\nagement judgements are described as follows. Actual \\namounts may differ from the estimates. Changes in the \\nestimates and management judgements can have a \\nmaterial impact on the Consolidated Financial State-\\nments.  \\nRecoverable amounts of cash -generating units and \\nequity -method investments  \\nIn the context of impairment tests for non -financial \\nassets, estimates have to be made to determine the \\nrecoverable amounts of cash -generating units. As-\\nsumptions have to be made in particular with regard to \\nfuture cash inflows and outflows for the planning peri-\\nod and the following periods. The estimates mainly \\nrefer to future unit sales, growth in the respective mar-\\nkets and the profitability of the products, which are \\nalso highly dynamic and thus uncertain as a result of \\nthe transition to electric mobility. Therefore, a risk as-\\nsessment and sensitivity analyses are performed when  deriving the value in use. On the basis of the impair-\\nment tests carried out in 2023, the recoverable \\namounts are larger than the net assets of the Group’s \\ncash- generating units.   \\nWhen objective evidence of impairment or impairment \\nreversal is present, estimates and assessments also \\nhave to be made to determine the recoverable amount \\nof an equity -method investment. The determination of \\nthe recoverable amount is based on assumptions re-\\ngarding future business developments for the determi-\\nnation of the expected future cash flows of that in-\\nvestment. On the balance sheet date, the carrying \\namount of equity -method investments was €13,104 \\nmillion (31 December 2022: €13,530 million).   Recoverable amount of equipment on  \\noperating  leases  \\nThe Mercedes -Benz Group  regularly reviews the factors \\ndetermining the values of its leased vehicles (carrying \\namount as of 31 December 2023: €41,712 milllion;  \\n31 December 2022: €41,552 million). In particular, it is \\nnecessary to estimate the residual values of vehicles, \\nwhich constitute a substantial part of the expected \\nfuture cash flows from equipment on operating  leases. \\nIn this context, assumptions are made regarding major \\ninfluencing factors, such as the expected number of \\nreturned vehicles, the latest remarketing results and \\nfuture vehicle model changes. Those assumptions are \\ndetermined either by qualified  estimates or by publica-\\ntions p rovided by expert third parties. Q ualified esti-\\nmates are based, as far as publicly available, on exter-\\nnal data with consideration of internally available addi-\\ntional information such as historical experience of price \\ndevelopments and sale prices. The residual values thus \\ndetermined serve as a basis for depreciation; changes \\nin residual values lead either to prospective adjust-\\nments of the depreciation or, in the case of a signifi-\\ncant decline in expected residual values, to an impair-\\nment. If depreciation is prospectively adjusted, chang-\\nes in estimates of residual values do not have a direct \\neffect but are equally distr ibuted over the remaining \\nterm of the lease contract .'),\n",

Many factors are taken into \\nconsideration in this context including historical loss \\nexperience, the size and composition of certain portfo-\\nlios, current economic events and conditions and the \\ncurrent fair values and adequacy of collaterals. In addi-\\ntion to historical and current information on losses, \\nappropriate and reliable forward- looking information \\non factors is also included. This information includes \\nmacroeconomic factors (e.g. gross domestic product \\ngrowth, unemployment rate, cost performance index) \\nand forecasts of future economic conditions. For re-\\nceivables from financial services, these forecasts are \\nperformed using a scenario analysis (basic scenario, \\noptimistic scenario and pessimistic scenario). Further \\nexternal information which cannot be depicted in the \\nscenarios, is -  as far as necessary - included in the \\nassessment through subsequent adjustments. Changes \\nto the estimation and assessment of these factors in-\\nfluence the allowance for credit losses with a resulting \\nimpact on the Group’s net profit.   Product warranties  \\nThe Group provides various types of product warran-\\nties, depending on the type of product and market \\nconditions. Provisions for product warranties (carrying \\namount as of 31 December 2023: €6,399 million;  \\n31 December 2022: €6,576 million) are generally recog-\\nnized at the time of vehicle sale. In order to determine \\nthe extent of these provisions, assumptions have to be \\nmade concerning the type and extent of future warran-\\nty claims and goodwill cases, as well as on possible \\nrecall campaigns for each model series. These assess-\\nments are based on experience of the frequency and \\nextent of vehicle faults and defects in the past. In addi-\\ntion, the estimates also include assumptions on the \\namounts of potential repair costs per vehicle and the \\neffects of possible time or mileage limits. The provi-\\nsions are regularly adjusted to reflect new information.  Liability and litigation risks and governmental   \\nproceedings  \\nVarious legal proceedings, claims and governmental \\ninvestigations are pending against Mercedes -Benz \\nGroup AG and its subsidiaries on a wide range of top-\\nics. If the outcome of such legal proceedings is detri-\\nmental to the Mercedes -Benz Group, the Group may be \\nrequired to pay substantial compensatory and punitive \\ndamages, to undertake service actions or recall cam-\\npaigns, to pay fines or to carry out other costly actions. \\nLitigation and governmental investigations often in-\\nvolve complex legal issues and are connected with a \\nhigh degree of uncertainty. Accordingly, the assess-\\nment of whether an obligation exists on the balance \\nsheet date as a result of an event in the past, and \\nwhether a future cash outflow is likely and the obliga-\\ntion can be reliably estimated, largely depends on es-\\ntimations by the management. The Mercedes -Benz \\nGroup regularly evaluates the current stage of legal \\nproceedings, also with the involvement of external \\nlegal counsel. It is therefore possible that the amounts \\nof provisions for pending or threatened proceedings \\nwill have to be regularly restated due to new expected \\ndevelopments. As of 31 December 2023, the carrying \\namounts of provisions for liability and litigation risks \\nare €2,104 million (31 December 2022: €2,755 million). \\nChanges in estimates and assumptions can have a ma-\\nterial effect on the Group’s future profitability, liquidity \\nand capial resources and financial position . It is also \\npossible that provisions recognized for some legal \\nproceedings may turn out to be insufficient once such'),\n",

At the \\nend of October 2022, the Mercedes -Benz Group signed \\ncontracts with the Russian car dealer Avtodom AO for \\nthe sale of the shares in the Russian subsidiaries.  \\nA degree of discretion has been exercised in the con-\\nsideration and subsequent derivation of the effects of \\nthe sanctions and counter -sanctions on the business \\nactivities.  \\nThe recognition and valuation of the assets and liabili-\\nties due to the discontinuation of the business activi-\\nties in Russia, in particular the processing of existing \\ntransactions, resulted in expenses of around €0.7 bil-\\nlion in the automotive segments in 2022. Total expens-\\nes of around €0.2 billion resulted from the measure-\\nment of credit default risks and increased refinancing \\nexpenses in the segment Mercedes -Benz Mobility. The \\nbulk of the expenses were included in cost of sales.  \\nAs of 31 December 2022, completion of the transaction \\nwas still subject to authorities’ approval and the im-\\nplementation of the contractually agreed conditions.  \\nWith the closing of the transaction on 19 April 2023, the \\nshares of Russian subsidiaries were deconsolidated.  The sale of the Russian subsidiaries resulted in no  \\nsignificant cash inflow. This led to a cash outflow in the \\namount of the disposed cash and cash equivalents of \\n€91 million, which is mainly attributable to the Mer-\\ncedes- Benz Mobility segment.  \\nThe assets of €976 million disposed of with the decon-\\nsolidation essentially include property, plant and \\nequipment of €290 million and receivables from finan-\\ncial services of €280 million. In addition, cash and cash \\nequivalents of €91 million are included. The disposed \\nliabilities of € 1,065 million include in particular provi-\\nsions of €636 million and financing liabilities of € 347 \\nmillion. The Group had issued a global guarantee for \\nthe financing liabilities to financial institutions, which \\nended when the transaction was completed. The con-\\ntingent liabilities reported as of 31 December 2022 in \\nconnection with the cessation of business activities in \\nRussia were also derecognized upon completion of the \\ntransaction.  \\nThe transaction costs amounted to €3 million. After \\nrealizing the currency reserve of €291 million, a loss on \\ndisposal of €205 million resulted. This was reported in \\nother operating expenses. Expenses of €276 million \\nwere attributable to the Mercedes -Benz Mobility seg-\\nment; the Mercedes- Benz Cars and Mercedes -Benz \\nVans segments generated income of €66 million and \\n€5 million, respectively.  Sale of Daimler’s commercial vehicle business  \\nWith the completion of the spin -off and hive -down of \\nthe Daimler commercial vehicle business substantial \\nparts of the former Daimler commercial vehicle busi-\\nness including the associated financial services busi-\\nness were deconsolidated on 9 December 2021.  \\nThe initially remaining financial services of the Daimler \\ncommercial vehicle business were sold to Daimler \\nTruck Holding AG or its subsidiaries in 2022. At the \\nMercedes- Benz Mobility segment, assets of €3,191 mil-\\nlion and liabilities of € 746 million were disposed of on \\nor before 31  December 2022.  \\nIn addition, in individual countries, investments in op-\\nerating entities or business operations of the former \\ncommercial vehicle business were sold to external third \\nparties in 2022. Assets of €149 million and liabilities of \\n€106 million, mainly allocated to the Mercedes -Benz \\nCars segment, were disposed of on or before 31 De-\\ncember 2022.  \\nThe Group received €2,355 million from the (in the \\nprior year partially still preliminary) purchase prices in \\n2022, including the repayment of the existing intra -\\nGroup financing liabilities of the companies and busi-\\nness activities within the Mercedes -Benz Group.  \\nThe valuation and sale and the transfer of the Mer-\\ncedes- Benz Mobility companies resulted in net ex-\\npenses of €184 million in 2022 (excluding transaction'),\n",

When the other agreements became effective \\nin January 2022, the Group lost control over Mercedes -\\nBenz Grand Prix Ltd. and included the remaining 33.3% \\ninterest in the company in the Consolidated Financial \\nStatements using the equity method. The sale of the \\nshares resulted in other operating income of \\n€385 million in the Mercedes- Benz Cars segment in the \\nfirst quarter of 2022. The purchase price payment \\nagreed for 2023 resulted in a cash inflow of \\n€144 million.   4. Revenue \\nRevenue in 2023 was slightly above the previous year’s \\nlevel. The increase in revenue was primarily due to \\nhigher unit sales and improved pricing at the Mer-\\ncedes- Benz Vans segment. Revenue in the Mercedes-\\nBenz Cars segment was also higher, primarily due to a \\nfurther improvement in pricing . However, negative \\nexchange- rate effects had an opposing effect, causing \\na reduction in revenue.  \\nRevenue disclosed in the Cons olidated Statement of \\nIncome includes revenue from contracts with custom-\\ners, which are in the scope of IFRS 15 (revenue accord-\\ning to IFRS 15),  and other revenue not in the scope of \\nIFRS 15.  The composition of the re venue in the Consol-\\nidated Statement of Income is shown by region in Note \\n34. Revenue according to IFRS 15  is disaggregated by the \\ntwo categories - type of products and services and \\ngeographical region s. The category type of products \\nand services corresponds to the reporte d segments.  \\nRevenue a ccording to IFRS 15 includes revenue that \\nwas i ncluded in contract liabilities at 31 December \\n2022 in an amount of €2,903 million (20 22: € 2,965 \\nmillion) and revenue from performance obligations fully \\n(or partially) satisfied in previous periods  in an amount \\nof €467 million (2022: €442 million). Revenue related \\nto performance obligations that were unsatisfied (or \\npartially unsatisfied) by the end of the reporting period \\nthat is expected to be recognized within three years \\namounted to €6,663 million at 31 December 2023 \\n(2022: €6,437 million). This revenue is mainly derived \\nfrom long -term service and maintenance contracts and \\nextended warranties. It does not include performance \\nobligations from customer contracts that have initial \\nexpected durations of one year or less. The number of \\nvehicles , for which the expected original delivery time \\nwill exceed twelve  months,  was immaterial and is \\ntherefore not part of the disclosed amount.

From the current perspective, the retained earnings of \\nnon- German subsidiaries are largely intended to be \\nreinvested in those operations. The Group did not rec-\\nognize deferred tax liabilities on retained earnings \\nwhich are intended to be reinvested at non -German \\nsubsidiaries of €27,529 million (202 2: €27,469 million). \\nIf those earnings were paid out as dividends, an \\namount of 5% would be taxed under German taxation \\nrules and, if applicable, with non -German withholding \\ntax. Additionally, other income  tax consequences might \\narise if the dividends first have to be distributed by a \\nnon- German subsidiary to a non -German holding com-\\npany. Normally, the distribution would lead to an addi-\\ntional income  tax expense. Estimating the amount of \\ntaxable temporary differences for these undistributed \\nforeign earnings would require a disproportionate ef-\\nfort. \\nThe Group has various unresolved issues concerning \\nopen tax years. The Mercedes -Benz Group believes \\nthat it has recognized adequate liabilities for any future \\nincome taxes that may be owed for all open tax years. \\nNevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that tax payments \\nmight exceed the liabilities recognized in the financial \\nstatements.  As a result of future adjudications or changes in the \\nopinions of the fiscal authorities, it cannot be ruled out \\nthat the Mercedes -Benz Group might receive tax re-\\nfunds for previous years. In particular, from 2012 to \\n2021, Mercedes -Benz Group AG incurred currency ex-\\nchange -rate related losses from the financing of Group \\ncompanies based abroad totalling €2.1 billion, which \\nwere compensated by corresponding hedging instru-\\nments. For the years until 2021, the German tax author-\\nities consider that exchange -rate related losses from \\nthe financing of Group companies are generally not to \\nbe recognized, while the compensating profits from the \\nhedging activities remain taxable. In 2021, the German \\nModernization of Corporate Income Tax Act stipulated \\nthat such exchange- rate losses are generally deducti-\\nble. However, this only applies from 2022 onwards. The \\nCompany does not share the legal opinion represented \\nby the tax authorities for the years up to 2021. In the \\nmeantime, a lawsuit has also been filed with the Fi-\\nnance Court.'),\n",

Its product portfo-\\nlio comprises light -, medium - and heavy -duty trucks, \\ncity buses and intercity buses, coaches and bus chas-\\nsis. In addition financial services aligned to the product \\nportfolio are offered. The investment is reported in the \\nreconciliation of the reportable segments of the Group.  \\nThe result in financial year 2023 amounted to \\n€797 million (2022: € 226 million). In 2022, the earnings \\nincluded income of €59 million from the contribution of \\napproximately 5% of the shares in Daimler Truck to the \\nMercedes- Benz Pension Trust.  \\nWith the approval of the Supervisory Board, the Board \\nof Management of Daimler Truck resolved a share buy-\\nback programme on 10 July 2023. The acquisition of the \\ntreasury shares on the stock exchange began on 2 Au-\\ngust 2023. During the share buyback programme, the \\nMercedes- Benz Group did not sell any of its Daimler \\nTruck shares. The shareholding remains unchanged  \\n30.00%, while a shareholding of 30.66% is assumed for \\nthe development of the equity- method carrying \\namount as of 31 December 2023. In June 2023, the \\nAnnual General Meeting of Daimler Truck resolved a \\ndividend of €1.30 per share. The distribution led to a \\ncash inflow of €321 million and reduced the carrying \\namount of the investment accordingly.  Beijing Benz Automotive Co., Ltd.   \\nBeijing Benz Automotive Co., Ltd. (BBAC) produces and \\ndistributes  Mercedes- Benz cars and spare parts in \\nChina. The investment and the proportionate share in \\nthe results of BBAC are allocated to the Mercedes -Benz \\nCars  segment.  \\nIn the second  quarter of 202 3, the shareholders of \\nBBAC resolved the distribution of  a dividend of €903 \\nmillion. A further distribution of € 767 million was re-\\nsolved in the fourth quarter of 2023. The distributions \\nreduced the shareholding’s carrying amount  and \\ncaused a cash inflow of €1,595 million.  \\nThe Mercedes -Benz Group plans to contribute addi-\\ntional equity of approximately €0.2 billion in accord-\\nance with the shareholding ratio at BBAC. There Holding B.V.  \\nThere Holding B.V. (THBV) owns shares of HERE Inter-\\nnational B.V. (HERE). HERE is one of the world’s largest \\nmanufacturers of digital road maps for navigation sys-\\ntems. The high -resolution maps provide one of the \\nfoundations for autonomous driving. THBV is account-\\ned for as an associated company in the Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements of Mercedes -Benz Group AG  \\nusing the equity method and is assigned to the  \\nMercedes- Benz  Cars segment.  \\nAs part of a strategic realignment and refinancing of \\nHERE, the Mercedes- Benz Group, along with other \\nshareholders of the associated company THBV, con-\\ntributed additional equity of €118 million into THBV  \\nthrough Mercedes -Benz AG in the first half of 2023. \\nThe capital increases led to a corresponding increase in \\nthe equity -method carrying amount. The funds from \\nthe capital injection were transferred by THBV to HERE \\nin order to increase HERE’s liquidity .  \\nThe strategic repositioning led to a reassessment of the \\nbusiness development of HERE in the second quarter \\nof 2023. Due to this THBV recognized an impairment on \\nthe carrying amount of HERE.

The bonds can be offered in exchange for cash and/or non -cash contributions, in particular for shares \\nin other companies. The terms and conditions of the \\nbonds can include warranty obligations or conversion \\nobligations. The bonds can be issued once or several \\ntimes, wholly or in instalments, or simultaneously in \\nvarious tranches as well as by subsidiaries of the Com-\\npany within the meaning of Sections 15 et seq. of the \\nGerman Stock Corporation Act (AktG).

Share buyback programmes  \\nOn the basis of the authorization to acquire the Com-\\npany’s own shares given by the Annual General Meeting \\non 8 July 2020, the Board of Management, with the \\napproval of the Supervisory Board, resolved a share \\nbuyback programme on 16 February 2023. The acquisi-\\ntion of treasury shares worth up to €4 billion (not in-\\ncluding incidental costs) on the stock exchange over a \\nperiod of up to two years began on 3 March 2023. The \\nrepurchased shares are to be cancelled at a later date. \\nMercedes- Benz Group AG has separately agreed with \\nBeijing Automotive Group Co., Ltd. and Geely Group \\nthat they will each keep their share in all voting shares \\nof Mercedes- Benz Group AG below 10% by divesting \\ntheir shares on a pro -rata basis concurrently with the \\nshare buyback programme.  \\nFrom March to December  2023, as part of the share \\nbuyback programme, 29 million of the Company’s own \\nshares were repurchased at a purchase price of €1,887 \\nmillion, representing €83 million or 2.70%  of the share \\ncapital. The purchase price was recorded under treas-\\nury shares together with  a liability of € 369 million for \\nbuyback obligations.  \\nOn 21 February 2024, Mercedes- Benz Group AG has \\nresolved to implement a share buyback policy. Based \\non such policy, the future Free Cash Flow from the \\nindustrial business (as available post potential small -\\nscale M&A) generated beyond the approximately 40% \\ndividend payout ratio of Group net profit  shall be used to fund share buybacks with the purpose of redeeming \\nshares.  \\nIn this context, Mercedes -Benz Group AG moreover  \\nhas resolved to conduct a further share buyback pro-\\ngramme, through which it is intended to acquire own \\nshares worth up to €3 billion (not including incidental \\ncosts) on the stock exchange and to then cancel them. \\nThe further share buyback programme will be based on \\nthe authorization by the Annual General Meeting of \\nMercedes- Benz Group AG on 8 July 2020, authorizing \\nthe Board of Management to acquire, with the approval \\nof the Supervisory Board, own shares up to a maximum \\nof 10% of the share capital until 7 July 2025.

The amount of cash paid a fter the \\nend of the holding period is based on the final  number \\nof vested phantom shares (determined after three  \\nyear s according to the degree of target achievement of \\nspecific  performance indicators) multiplied by the \\nquoted price of the Mercedes -Benz Group ’s ordinary \\nshares  (calculated as an average price over a specified \\nperiod a fter the end of the four -year plan period). The \\nvesting period is therefore four years. For the existing \\nplans, the quoted price of the phantom shares to be \\nused for the payout is limited to 2.5 times the phantom \\nshare price at the date of grant. F urthermore , in the \\ncase of the plans PPSP 2020 to 2022, the payout for \\nthe members of the Board of Management is also lim-\\nited to 2.5 times the allotment value used to determine \\nthe preliminary number of phantom shares. The limita-\\ntion of the payout for the members of the Board of \\nManagement also includes the dividend  equivalents .  For the issued PPSP 2020 to 2022, the degree of target \\nachievement is determined on the basis of the relative \\nshare performance, which measures the performance \\ndevelopment of the Mercedes -Benz Group share com-\\npared with the development of a performance index \\nbased on a group of competitors including the Mer-\\ncedes- Benz Group, and the return on sales (RoS) of the \\nMercedes- Benz Group compared with the average \\nrevenue- weighted RoS of a group of competitors. PPSP \\n2023 includes environmental, social and governance \\n(ESG) targets in the achievement of objectives in order \\nto promote the sustainable realignment and long- term, \\nsustainable development of the Group. From PPSP \\n2023, overall target achievement will be determined \\nbased on the weighted achievement of the financial \\ntargets (relative share performance and RoS) and the \\nESG targets over the three -year performance period. \\nThe achievement of the financial targets accounts for \\n80% and the achievement of the ESG targets for 20% \\nof the overall target achievement of the PPSP.  \\nIn the case of plans PPSP 2020 to 2022, special rules \\napply for the members of the Board of Management: \\nthe Mercedes -Benz Group’s RoS must be not only \\nequal to but higher than that of the competitors in \\norder to obtain the  same target achievement as the \\nother plan participants.  Furthermore, an additional limit  \\non target achievement was agreed upon for the refer-\\nence parameter RoS for the members of the Board of \\nManagemen t. In the case of target achievement  be-\\ntween 195% and 200%, an additional comparison is \\nmade on the basis of the RoS achieved in absolute terms.  If the actual RoS  for the automotive business is  \\nbelow the strategic target  in the third year of the  per-\\nformance period, target achievement is limited to 195%.  \\nThe Group recogni zes a provisio n for awarding the \\nPPSP in the Provisions for other risks in the Consoli-\\ndated Statement of Financial P osition. Since payment \\nper vested phantom share depends on the quoted \\nprice of Mercedes- Benz Group ’s share, that quoted \\nprice essentially represents the fair value of each \\nphantom share  at the balance sheet date . The propor-\\ntionate remuneration expenses from the PPSP recog-\\nnized in the individual years are measured based on \\nthe price of Mercedes- Benz Group shares and the es-\\ntimated target achievement.'),\n",

Pensions and similar  \\nobligations  \\nCommitments specific to various countries for defined \\nbenefit pension plans and defined contribution pension \\nplans exist at the Mercedes -Benz  Group.  \\nFurthermore,  certain foreign subsidiaries, mainly in the \\nUnited States, provide their employees with post -\\nemployment healthcare benefits with defined entitle-\\nments, which have to be accounted for as defined ben-\\nefit plans.  \\nThe following table shows the composition of  provi-\\nsions for pensions and similar obligations.  \\n \\nComposition of provisions for pensions and similar obligations  \\n At 31 December  \\n 2023¹  2022  \\nIn millions of euros    \\n   \\nProvisions for pension benefits  760 683 \\nProvisions for post -employment  \\nhealthcare benefits  330 338 \\n 1,090 1,021 \\n1 Including the part of pension obligations that was reclassified to the balance sheet \\nitem liabilities held for sale.  Defined benefit pension plans  \\nProvisions for pension obligations are made for defined \\nbenefit pension commitments to active and former \\nemployees of the Mercedes- Benz  Group and their sur-\\nvivors. The defined benefit pension plans provided by \\nthe Group generally vary according to the economic, \\ntax and legal circumstances of the country concerned. \\nMost of the defined benefit pension commitments also \\nprovide benefits in the case of invalidity and death.  \\nPension plans and pension  \\nplan assets  \\nMost employees in Germany have  defined benefit pen-\\nsion commitments; most of the pension commitments  \\nfor the active workforce are based on individual retire-\\nment benefit accounts, to which the Company makes \\nannual contributions. The amount of the contributions \\nfor non -exempt employees depends on the tariff clas-\\nsification in the respective year or on their respective \\nincome; for executives it depends on their respective \\nincome. For the commitments to retirement benefits \\nmade prior to 2011, the contributions continue to be \\nconverted into capital components and credited to the \\nindividual pension accounts with the application of \\nfixed factors relat ed to each employee’s age.  The con-\\nversion factors in clude a fixed value increase. For the \\ncommitments to retirement benefits made as of 2011, \\nthe Company guar antees at a minimum the value of the \\ncontributions paid into a cash -balance plan. Pension payments are made either as a life annuity, twelve \\nannual instalments, or a single lump sum. \\nIn addition, previously concluded defined benefit plans \\nexist which primarily depend on employees’ wage -tariff \\nclassification upon transition into the benefit phase \\nand which foresee a life annuity.  \\nAs well as the employer -financed pension plans grant-\\ned by German companies, the employees of some \\ncompa nies are also offered various earnings -\\nconversion mod els. \\nMost of the pension obligations in Germany relating to \\ndefined benefit pension commitments are funded by \\ninvestment funds. Contractual trust arrangements \\n(CTA) exist between Mercedes -Benz Group  AG as well \\nas some subsidiaries in Germany and the Mercedes-\\nBenz  Pension Trust e.  V. The Mercedes -Benz Pension \\nTrust e.  V. acts as a collateral trust fund.  \\nIn 2018, Mercedes- Benz Group  AG transferred certain \\npension obligations and plan assets of retired employ-\\nees and their survivors to Mercedes- Benz Pen-\\nsionsfonds  AG (previously  Daimler Pensionsfonds  AG; \\npension fund). These benefits are admin istrated by that \\nnon- insurance -like pension fund, which falls under the \\nscope of the Act on the Supervision of Insurance Un-\\ndertakings and is therefore subject to the oversight of \\nthe Federal Financial Supervisory Agency (BaFin).'),\n",

Accordingly, the committed benefits are \\nintended to contribute to additional financial security \\nduring retirement, and in the case of death or invalidity \\nto be capable of being planned and fulfilled by the \\nrespective company of the Group and to have a low -\\nrisk structure. In addition, a committee exists that ap-\\nproves new pension plans and amendments to existing \\npension plans as well as policies relating to company \\nretirement benefits.  \\nThe obligations from defined benefit pension commit-\\nments and the pension plan assets can be subject to \\nfluctuations over time. This can have a negative or a \\npositive effect on the funded status. Fluctuations in the \\ndefined benefit pension obligations result at the Mer-\\ncedes- Benz Group in particular from changes in finan-\\ncial assumptions such as discount rates and increases \\nin the cost of living, but also from changes in demo-\\ngraphic assumptions such as adjusted life expectan-\\ncies. With most of the German plans, expected long -\\nterm wage and salary increases do not have an impact \\non the amount of the obligation.  The fair value of the plan assets is predominantly  \\ndeter mined by the s ituation on the capital markets. \\nUnfavour able developments, especially of equity prices \\nand fixed- interest securities, could reduce that fair \\nvalue. The diversification of investment funds, the en-\\ngagement of asset managers using quantitative and \\nqualitative anal yses, and the continual monitoring of \\nperformance and risk help to reduce the associated \\ninvestment risk. As long as the commitments of the \\ndefined benefit pension plans remain overfun ded by \\nthe plan assets, the Mer cedes- Benz Group will only \\nmake additional pension contributions when legally and \\neconomically necessary.  \\nAs a general principle, it is the Group’s objective to \\ndesign new pension commitments as defined benefit \\nplans based on capital components or on contribu-\\ntions, or as defined contribution plans.'),\n",

Legal proceedings \\nMercedes- Benz Group AG and its subsidiaries are con-\\nfronted with various legal proceedings, claims as well \\nas governmental investigations and orders (le gal pro-\\nceedings) on a large num ber of topics, including vehicle \\nsafety, emissions, fuel economy, financial services, \\ndealer, supp lier and other contractual rela tionships, \\nintellectual property rights (including but not limited to \\npatent infringement action s), warranty claims, envi-\\nronmen tal matters, antitrust matters (including actions \\nfor damages) as well as investor litigation. Product -\\nrelated litigation involves , among other things, claims \\nalleging faults in vehicles. Some of these claims are \\nasserted by way of class actions. If the outcome of \\nsuch legal proceedings is detrimental to the Mercedes-\\nBenz Group or such legal proceedings are settled, the \\nGroup may encounter substantial financial burdens, \\ne.g. from damages payments or service actions, recall \\ncampaigns, monetary penalties or other costly actions, \\nwhich would adversely affect the earnings of Mer-\\ncedes- Benz Group AG. Legal  proceedings and related \\nsettle ments may also have an impact on the c ompany’s \\nreputation.  Diesel emission behaviour:  \\ngovernmental proceedings  \\nThe Mercedes- Benz Group is continuously sub ject to \\ngovernmental information requests, inquiries, in vesti-\\ngations, administrative or ders and proceedings relating \\nto various laws and regulations in connection with die-\\nsel exhaust emissions.  \\nThe corresponding activities of various authorities \\nworldwide, which were already reported in the past, are \\npartly ongoing, as described below . These activities \\nparticularly relate to test results, the emission control \\nsystems used in Mercedes -Benz diesel vehicles and/or \\nthe interactions of the Mercedes- Benz Group with the \\nrelevant authorities as well as related legal issues and \\nimplications, including, but not limited to, under appli-\\ncable environmental, criminal, consumer protection \\nand antitrust laws.  \\nIn the United States, Mercedes -Benz Group AG and \\nMercedes- Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA) reached agreements \\nin the third quarter of 2020 with various auth orities to \\nsettle civil environ mental claims regarding the emission \\ncontrol systems of cer tain diesel vehicles . These \\nagreements have become final and effective. The au-\\nthorities took  the position that the Mercedes- Benz \\nGroup had failed to disclose Auxiliary Emission Control \\nDevices (AECDs) in certain of its US diesel vehicles and \\nthat several of these AECDs were  illegal defeat devices.'),\n",

The failure to meet certain of \\nthose obligations may trigger additional stipulated \\npenalties. In the first quarter of 2021, the Mercedes-\\nBenz Group paid the civil penal ties; provisions have \\nbeen rec ognized for the emission modifi cation pro-\\ngramme and other measures.  \\nAs already reported, in April 2016, the U.S. Department \\nof Justice (DOJ ) requested that  the Mercedes- Benz \\nGroup conduct an internal investigation. The Mercedes-\\nBenz  Group  conducted such  an internal investigation in \\ncooperation with the DOJ‘s investigation; the DOJ‘s \\ninvestigation remains open. I n addition, further US \\nstate au thorities have opened investigations pursuant \\nto both local environmental and consu mer protection \\nlaws and have re quested documents and information.  In Canada, the environmental regulator Environment \\nand Climate Change Canada (ECCC) is conducting an \\ninvestigation in connection with diesel exhaust emis-\\nsions based on the suspicion of potential violations of, \\namongst others, the Canadian Environmental Protec-\\ntion Act, as well as undisclosed AECDs and defeat de-\\nvices. The Mercedes -Benz Group continues to coop er-\\nate with the investigating authorities. \\nIn Germany, the Stuttgart public prosecutor’s office \\nissued a fine notice against Mercedes -Benz in Septem-\\nber 2019 based on a negligent violation of supervisory \\nduties, thereby concluding the related administrative \\noffen se proceedings against Mercedes -Benz. In July \\n2021, the local court of Böblingen issued penal orders \\nagainst three Mercedes -Benz employees based on, \\namongst others, fraud, which have become final. The \\ncriminal investigation proceedings of the Stuttgart pub-\\nlic prosecutor’s office against further Mercedes -Benz \\nemployees on the suspicion of, amongst others, fraud \\nhave meanwhile been discontinued . \\nBetween 2018 and 2020, the German Fede ral Motor \\nTransport Authority (KBA) issued subsequent auxiliary \\nprovisions for the EC type approvals of ce rtain Mer-\\ncedes- Benz diesel vehicles, and ordered mandatory \\nrecalls as well as, in some cases, stops of the first reg-\\nistration. In autumn 2022  and in December 2023 , the \\nKBA issued further decisions regarding vehicles \\nequipped with various EU6 or EU5 diesel engine s. In \\neach of those cases, it held that certain calibrations of \\nspecified functionalities are to be quali fied as imper-missible defeat devices. Mercedes -Benz has a contrary \\nlegal opinion on this question and has filed timely ob-\\njections against the KBA’s administrative orders and \\ndeter minations mentioned above. Insofar as the KBA \\nhas not remedied the objections, Mercedes -Benz has \\nfiled lawsuits with the competent administrative court \\nto have the controversial questions at issue clarified in \\na court of law. Irrespective of such objections and the \\nlawsuits that are now pending, the Mer cedes- Benz \\nGroup continues to cooperate fully with the KBA. To a \\nlarge extent, the remedial actions requested by the \\nKBA were developed by the Mercedes -Benz Group and \\nassessed and approved by the KBA; the necessary \\nrecalls were initiated. For some of the vehicles affected \\nby the KBA’s decision from December 2023, develop-\\nments, examinations and approvals of the remedial \\nmeasures are still pending. It cannot be ruled out that \\nunder certain circumstances, software updates may \\nhave to be reworked, or further delivery and registra-\\ntion stops may be ordered or resolved by the c ompany \\nas a precautionary measure, also with regard to the \\nused car, leasing and financing businesses. In the \\ncourse of its regular market supervision, the KBA rou-\\ntinely conduct s further reviews of Mercedes -Benz ve-\\nhicles and asks  questions about technical elements of \\nthe vehicles. In addition, the Group continues to be in a \\ndialogue with the German Federal Ministry for Digital \\nand Transport (BMDV) to conclude the analysis of the \\ndiesel -related emissions matter and to further the up-\\ndate of affected customer vehicles. In light of the \\naforementioned administrative orders issued by the \\nKBA, and continued discussions with the KBA and the'),\n",

Since 1 Sep-\\ntember 2020, this also applies to other responsible \\nauthorities of other member states and the European \\nCommission, which conduct market surveillance under \\nthe new European Type Approval Regulation and can \\ntake measures upon assumed non- compliance, irre-\\nspective of the place of the original type approval, and \\nalso to the British market surveillance authority DVSA \\n(Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency).  \\nIn addition to the aforementioned authorities, authori-\\nties of various foreign states, particularly the South \\nKorean Ministry of Environment and the South Korean \\ncompetition authority (Korea Fair Trade Commission) \\nare conducting various investigations and/or proce-\\ndures in connection with diesel exhaust emissions. In \\nthis context, these South Korean authorities have made \\ndeterminations and imposed sanctions against Mer-\\ncedes- Benz which Mercedes- Benz has appealed. In the \\nsame context, national antitrust authorities of various \\ncountries are also conducting investigations, including \\nthe South Korean antitrust authority, which has made \\ncertain findings and imposed fines on some car manu-\\nfacturers. In February 2024, the criminal proceeding in \\nSouth Korea was concluded.  \\nThe Mercedes- Benz Group continues to full y cooperate \\nwith the authori ties and institutions.  Diesel emission behaviour:  \\nconsumer actions and other lawsuits \\nin the United States, Germany and \\nother states  \\nIn a lawsuit filed by the Environmental Protection \\nCommission of Hillsborough County, Florida in Sep-\\ntember 2020, the plaintiff claim ed that, amongst oth-\\ners, Mercedes -Benz Group AG and MBUSA had violated \\nmunicipal regulations prohibiting vehicle tampering and \\nother conduct by using alleged devices claimed to im-\\npair the effectiveness of emission control systems. The \\nlawsuit was dismissed in the third quarter of 2022.  The \\nplaintiff’s appeal to this decision was dismissed in the \\nthird quarter of 2023. The decision is final, and the \\nproceedings are concluded. \\nConsumer class actions were filed against Mercedes -\\nBenz Group AG in Israel in February 2019 as well as \\nagainst Mercedes- Benz Group AG and further Group \\ncompanies in the United Kingdom since May 2020, in \\nthe Netherlands since June 2020, in Portugal as well as \\nsince November 2022 in Australia. The plaintiffs inter \\nalia assert that the Mercedes -Benz Group had used \\ndevices that impermissibly impair the effectiveness of \\nemission control systems in reducing nitrogen -oxide \\n(NOx ) emissions and which cause excessive emissions \\nfrom vehicles with diesel engines. Furthermore, they \\nclaim that Mercedes- Benz Group AG deceived consum-\\ners in connection with advertising Mercedes -Benz die-\\nsel vehicles. The proceedings in England and Wales consist of several individual lawsuits that have been \\nconsolidated into a class action. A class action lawsuit \\nis also pending in Scotland. In these proceedings, al-\\nlegedly injured parties must actively register for the \\nenforcement of claims (opt -in). The plaintiffs in the \\nconsumer class action in England and Wales also al-\\nlege, among other things, anti -competitive behaviour \\nrelating to technology for the treatment of diesel ex-\\nhaust emissions.  \\nIn Germany, a large number of customers of diesel \\nvehicles have filed lawsuits for damages or rescission \\nof sales contracts. They assert that the vehicles con-\\ntained illegal defeat devices and/or showed impermis-\\nsibly high emission or consumption values. They refer \\nin particular to the KBA’s recall orders (see above). \\nAlthough the number of pending cases is declining, a \\nfuture increase cannot be ruled out. Based on similar \\nallegations, the Federation of German Consumer Or-\\nganizations (Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband e. V.) \\nfiled a model declaratory action (Musterfeststellungs -\\nklage) against Mercedes -Benz Group AG with the \\nStuttgart Higher Regional Court in July 2021.

The investors allege that Mercedes -Benz \\nGroup AG did not immediately disclose inside infor-\\nmation in connection with the emission behaviour of its \\ndiesel vehicles and that it had made false and mislead-\\ning public statements. They further claim that the pur-\\nchase price of the financial instruments acquired by \\nthem (in particular Mercedes -Benz  Group  shares, for-\\nmerly Daimler AG shares) would have been lower if \\nMercedes- Benz Group AG had complied with its disclo-\\nsure obligations. Mercedes -Benz Group AG regards \\nthese allegations and claims as being without merit and \\nwill defend itself against them. In this context, the \\nStuttgart Higher Regional Court initiated model case \\nproceedings under the German Act on Model Case \\nProceedings in Disputes under Capital Markets Law \\n(KapMuG) in December 2021 (model case proceedings). \\nThe purpose of the model case proceedings is to reach \\na decision that is binding for the main proceedings \\nregarding common factual and legal questions. The \\nmain proceedings before the Stuttgart Regional Court \\nwill be suspended until a decision is reached on the \\nquestions submitted, insofar as they cannot be dis-\\nmissed independently of the questions to be decided in the model case proceedings. The decision in the \\nmodel case proceedings is binding for the suspended \\nmain proceedings. Multiple investors have used the \\npossibility to register claims in a considerable amount \\nwith the model case proceedings in order to suspend \\nthe period of limitation. Mercedes -Benz Group AG re-\\nmains of the view to have duly fulfilled its disclosure \\nobligations under capital markets law and defends \\nitself against the investors’ allegations also in these \\nmodel case proceedings.  Accounting assessment of the  \\nlegal proceedings in connection with \\ndiesel emission behaviour  \\nWith respect to the legal proceedings described in the \\ntwo preceding chapters, in accordance with IAS 37.92 \\nno further information is disclosed with respect to \\nwhether, or to what extent, provisions have been rec-\\nognized and/or contingent liabilities have been dis-\\nclosed, so as not to prejudice the Mer cedes- Benz  \\nGroup ’s position. For recognized provisions, this does \\nnot apply to the extent that a settl ement has been \\nreached or a proceeding has been concluded.  \\nOther legal proceedings \\nStarting in July 2017, a number of  class action suits \\nwere filed in the United States and Canada against \\nMercedes- Benz Group AG and other manufacturers of \\nautomobiles as well as a number of their North Ameri-\\ncan subsidiaries. Plaintiffs allege to have suffered dam-\\nages because defendants engaged in anticompetitive \\nbehaviour relating to vehicle technology, costs, suppli-\\ners, markets, and other competitive attributes, includ-\\ning diesel emissions control technology, since the \\n1990s. In June 2022, the proceedings in the United \\nStates were dismissed with final effect in favour of the \\nconcerned Mercedes -Benz Group companies. Further-\\nmore, in 2023, several class actions in Canada were \\nfinally dismissed as the plaintiffs discontinued their \\nclaims. The Mercedes- Benz Group also expects the'),\n",

This development leads to a \\nmaterial reduction of the risk associated with the class \\nactions. They therefore no longer qualify for separate \\nreporting, which is why the Mercedes -Benz Group will \\nno longer report on them in the future.  \\nAs already reported, class actions in connection with \\nTakata airbags are pending in the United States, Cana-\\nda and Israel. The lawsuits are based on allegations \\nthat, along with Takata entities and many other compa-\\nnies that sold vehicles equipped with Takata airbag \\ninflators, Mercedes- Benz Group companies and others \\nwere allegedly negligent in selling such vehicles, pur-\\nportedly not recalling them quickly enough, and failing \\nto warn consumers about a potential defect and/or to \\nprovide an adequate replacement airbag inflator. One \\nof the lawsuits in the United States also asserted \\nclaims by automotive recyclers who alleged injury be-\\ncause they were not able to re- sell salvaged airbag \\ninflators that are subject to the Takata recall. This claim \\nhas since then been finally dismissed. Also, the remain-\\ning consumer class action in the United States was \\ndismissed against  Mercedes- Benz Group AG in its en-\\ntirety, and against MBUSA in part. The plaintiffs have \\nappealed the dismissal of Mercedes- Benz Group AG \\nand the proceedings against MBUSA are still pending. \\nSince February 2023, the class actions in Canada were \\ndiscontinued by the plaintiffs; one of the class actions \\nwas finally dismissed and the formal court dismissal for \\nthe other class action is still pending. Mercedes -Benz Group AG continues to regard the pending claims as \\nbeing without merit, and the affected Group companies \\nwill continue to defend themselves against the claims. \\nContingent liabilities were disclosed to a low extent for \\nthis topic.  \\nIn October 2021, a number of Australian Mercedes -\\nBenz dealers lodged a claim against Mercedes -Benz \\nAustralia/Pacific Pty Ltd (MBAuP) with a Federal Court \\nin Australia. They allege that MBAuP forced the dealers \\nto accept a change in their business model from a \\ndealership model to an agency model and thus de-\\nprived them of the goodwill they created through their \\ninvestments in the Australian Mercedes -Benz dealer-\\nship network. They seek reinstatement of the dealer-\\nship model or, alternatively, compensation for the \\ndamage they allegedly incurred. In August 2023, the \\ncourt dismissed the claims in their entirety. In January \\n2024, the plaintiffs appealed the decision. MBAuP con-\\nsiders those claims to be without merit and continues \\nto defend itself against the claims.  Since 2022, a class action has been pending in the \\nUnited States alleging claims based on a voluntary \\nrecall of certain Mercedes -Benz ML -, GL- and R -Class \\nvehicles produced during the 2004 –2015 model years \\nfor potentially corroded brake boosters. Among other \\nthings, the plaintiffs allege that the brake boosters in \\nsuch vehicles can corrode and lead to reduced braking \\nforce. They allege failure to disclose the claimed defect \\nand assert various claims. A similar class action was \\nfiled in Israel. The Mercedes -Benz Group considers the \\nlawsuits to be without merit and defends itself against \\nthem .'),\n",

Such provisions \\nare recognized in the Group’s C onsolidated Financial \\nStatements and are b ased on estimates. If quantifiable, \\ncontingent liabilities in connection with legal proceed-\\nings are disclosed in the Group’s Consolidated Finan-\\ncial Statements. Risks resulting from legal proceedings \\nsometimes cannot be assessed reliably or only to a \\nlimited extent. Consequently, provisions recognized for \\nsome legal proceedings may turn out to be insufficient \\nonce such proceedings have ended. The Mer cedes-\\nBenz Group may also become l iable for payments in \\nlegal proceedings for which no provisions were recog-\\nnized and/or contingent liabilities were disclosed. Un-\\ncertainty exists with regard to the amounts or due \\ndates of possible cash outflows. Although the final \\nresult of any such proceedings could materi ally affect \\nthe Group’s operating results and cash flows for a par-\\nticular reporting period, the Mercedes- Benz Group \\nbelieves that it should not exert a sustained  influence \\non the Group’s finan cial position.  31. Contingent liabilities and  \\nother financial obligations  \\nContingent liabilities  \\nAt 31 December 2023 , the best estimate for obligations \\nfrom   contingent liabilities  was €2,553 million  (2022: \\n€4,122  million). The other contingent liabilities are \\nmainly related to the legal  proceedings and product \\nwarranties described in Note 30. Compared to the pre-\\nvious year, the  decrease in conti ngent liabilities is  a \\nresult of discontinuing the business activities in Russia \\nand the disposal of contingent liabilities with the reali-\\nzation of the transaction.   \\nOther financial obligations  \\nAt 31 December 2023, o ther financial obligations  exist  \\nfrom the acquisition of intangible assets, property, \\nplant and equipment and lease property   of \\n€5,684 million  (2022: €5,729 million ). In addition, the Mercedes- Benz Group  issued irrevo-\\ncable loan commitments  at 31 December 2023 . These \\nloan  commitments had not been utiliz ed as of that \\ndate. Further information with respect to these irrevo-\\ncable loan commitments is provided in Note 33.'),\n",

The fair values of \\nfinancial instruments were calculated on the basis of \\nmarket information available on the balance sheet \\ndate. The following methods and assumptions were \\nused.   \\nReceivables from financial services  \\nThe fair values of receivables from financial services \\nwith variable interest rates are estimated to be equal to \\nthe respective carrying amounts, because the agreed \\nupon interest rates and those available in the market \\ndo not significantly differ. The fair values of receivables \\nfrom financial services with fixed interest rates are \\ndetermined on the basis of discounted expected future \\ncash flows. Discounting is based on the current interest \\nrates at which similar loans with identical terms could \\nhave been obtained at 31 December 2023 and 31 De-\\ncember 2022.  Trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents \\nDue to the short terms and the fundamentally lower \\ncredit risk of these financial instruments, it is assumed \\nthat their fair values are equal to the carrying amounts.  \\nMarketable debt securities and similar investments, \\nother financial assets  \\nMarketable debt securities are recognized at fair value \\nthrough other comprehensive income or at fair value \\nthrough profit or loss. Similar investments are meas-\\nured at amortized cost and are not included in the \\nmeasurement hierarchy, as their carrying amounts are a \\nreasonable approximation of fair value due to the short \\nterms of these financial instruments and the funda-\\nmentally low credit risk.  \\nEquity instruments  are recognized at fair value through \\nother comprehensive  income or at fair value through \\nprofit or loss. Equity instruments recognized at fair \\nvalue through other comprehensive income are includ-\\ned in the table Carrying amounts and fair values of \\nfinancial instruments and primarily  comprise the shares \\nin Sila Nanotechnologies Inc., Momenta Global Limited \\nand Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings Plc.  The \\nremaining investments recognized at fair value through \\nother comprehensive income comprise further invest-\\nments not material on an individual basis .  Marketable debt securities and equity instruments \\nrecognized at fair value were measured using quoted \\nmarket prices at the end of the reporting period. If \\nquoted market prices are not available for these debt \\nand equity instruments, fair value measurement is \\nbased on inputs that are either directly or indirectly \\nobservable in active markets. Fair values are calculated \\nusing recognized financial valuation models such as \\ndiscounted cash  flow models or multiples.  \\nOther financial assets recognized at fair value through \\nprofit or loss  relate to derivative financial instruments \\nnot used in hedge accounting. These financial instru-\\nments as well as derivative financial instruments used \\nin hedge accounting  comprise:  \\n \\n- derivative currency hedging contracts; the fair values \\nof cross -currency interest  rate swaps are determined \\non the basis of the discounted estimated future cash \\nflows (taking account of credit premiums and default \\nrisks) using the market interest rates appropriate to \\nthe remaining terms of the financial instruments. The \\nmeasurement of currency forwards is based on mar-\\nket quotes of forward curves. Currency options are \\nmeasured with option -pricing models using market \\ndata. \\n- derivative interest  rate hedging contracts; the fair \\nvalues of interest rate hedging instruments (e.g. in-\\nterest rate swaps) are calculated on the basis of the \\ndiscounted estimated future cash flows (taking ac-\\ncount of credit premiums and default risks) using the'),\n",

Management of financial risks  \\nGeneral information on  \\nfinancial risks  \\nAs a result of its businesses and the global nature of its \\noperations, the Mercedes- Benz Group is exposed to \\nmarket risks from changes in foreign currency ex-\\nchange -rates and interest rates, while price risks arise \\nfrom the procurement  of raw materials and energy, for \\nexample. An equity price risk results from investments \\nin listed companies . In addition, the Group is exposed \\nto credit risks from its leasing and mainly financing \\nactivities and from its business operations (trade re-\\nceivables). Furthermore, the Group is exposed to coun-\\ntry and liquidity risks relating to its credit and market \\nrisks or a deterioration of its business  operations or \\nfinancial market disturbances. If these financial risks \\nmateriali ze, they could adversely affect the Group ’s \\nprofitability, liquidity and capital resources and finan-\\ncial position.  \\nThe Mercedes- Benz Group  has established internal \\npolicies for risk controlling procedures and for the use \\nof financial instruments, including a clear segregation \\nof duties with regard to financial activities, settlement, \\naccounting and the related controlling. The guidelines \\nupon which the Group’s risk management processes for \\nfinancial risks are based are designed to identify and \\nanalys e these risks throughout the Group, to set ap-propriate risk limits and controls and to monitor the \\nrisks by means of reliable and up- to-date administra-\\ntive and information systems. The guidelines and sys-\\ntems are regularly reviewed and adjusted to changes in \\nmarkets and products.  \\nThe Group manages and monitors these risks primarily \\nthrough its operating and financing activities and, if \\nrequired, through the use of derivative financial in-\\nstruments. The Mercedes- Benz Group  uses derivative \\nfinancial instruments exclusively for hedging financial \\nrisks that arise from its business operations or re fi-\\nnancing activities  or liquidity management . Without \\nthese derivative financial instruments, the Group would \\nbe exposed to higher financial risks. A dditional infor-\\nmation on financial instruments and especially on the \\nvolumes of the derivative financial instruments used is \\nincluded in Note 32. The  Mercedes- Benz Group regu-\\nlarly evaluates its financial risks with due consideration \\nof changes in key economic indicators and up- to-date \\nmarket information.'),\n",

As a consequence of \\nthese activities, the Group is exposed to credit risk, \\nwhich is monitored and managed based on defined \\nstandards, guidelines and procedures. The Mercedes-\\nBenz Group manages its credit risk irrespective of \\nwhether it is related to a financing contract or to an \\noperating lease or a finance lease contract. For this \\nreason, statements concerning the credit risk of Mer-\\ncedes- Benz  Mobility  refer to the entire financing and \\nleasing business, unless  otherwise specified.  \\nExposure to credit risk from financing and lease activi-\\nties is monitored based on the portfolio subject to \\ncredit risk. The portfolio subject to credit risk consists \\nof wholesale and retail receivables from financial ser-\\nvices and the portion of the operating  lease portfolio \\nthat is subject to credit risk. Receivables from financial \\nservices comprise claims arising from finance  lease \\ncontracts and repayment claims from financing loans. \\nThe operating lease portfolio is reported under equip-\\nment on operating leases in the Group’s Consolidated \\nStatement of Financial Position . Lease payments due \\nfrom operating lease contracts are recognized in re-\\nceivables from financial services.  The Mercedes- Benz  Mobility  segment has policies set-\\nting the framework for effective risk mana gement at a \\nglobal as well as a local level. In particular, these  poli-\\ncies deal with minimum requirements for all risk -\\nrelevant credit processes, the definition of financing \\nproducts offered, the evaluation of customer quality, \\nrequests for collateral and the treatment of unsecured \\nloans and non -performing claims. The limitation of \\nconcentration risks is implemented primarily by means \\nof global limits, which refer to customer exposures. To \\ncomply with these limits, Mercedes -Benz Mobility ap-\\nplies approval standards and measures to avoid con-\\ncentration risks. Only one customer was granted a \\ncredit line in the form of a large loan. The Mercedes -\\nBenz Mobility portfolio consists of a large number of \\nsmall and medium -sized enterprises and private cus-\\ntomers from more than 30 countries. At  31 December  \\n2023, this segment accounted for 72% of the portfolio.  With respect to its financing and lease activities, the \\nGroup holds collateral for customer transactions  limit-\\ning actual credit risk through its fair value . The value of \\ncollateral generally depends on the amount of the fi-\\nnanced assets. The financed vehicles usually serve as \\ncollateral. Furthermore, Mercedes- Benz  Mobility  limits  \\ncredit risk from financing and lease activities, for ex-\\nample through deposits from customers.  \\nFor the assessment of the default risk of retail and \\nsmall business customers , scoring systems are applied \\nto evaluate their creditworthiness . Corporate custom-\\ners are evaluated using internal rating instruments. \\nBoth evaluation processes use external credit bureau \\ndata if available. The scoring and rating results as well \\nas the availability of security and other risk mitigation \\ninstruments, such as deposits, guarantees and, to a \\nlesser extent, residual debt insurances, are essential \\nelements for credit decisions.'),\n",

Internal restructuring policies and practices \\nfor loan and leasing contracts are based on the indica-\\ntors or criteria which, in the judgement of local man-\\nagement, indicate that repayment will probably contin-\\nue and that the total proceeds expected to be derived \\nfrom the renegotiated contract exceed the expected \\nproceeds to be derived from immediate repossession \\nand remarketing.  In the case of receivables from finan-\\ncial services , significant modifications of financial as-\\nsets were only made in rare cases and  to an insignifi-\\ncant extent.  \\nThe allowance ratio decreased  compared to the previ-\\nous year due to the sale of the Russian Mercedes -Benz \\nMobility companies for which very high provisions were \\nrecorded in 2022.  The default rate has increased com-\\npared to the very low figures in the previous year, \\nmainly due to a challenging lending environment in the \\nUnited States.  For information on credit risks included in receivables \\nfrom financial services, see Note 14. Information on the \\nmeasurement of expected credit losses is provided in \\nNote 1.  \\nTrade receivables  \\nTrade receivables are mostly receivables from world-\\nwide sales of vehicles and spare parts. The credit risk \\nfrom trade receivables encompasses the default risk of \\ncustomers, e.g. dealers and general distribution com-\\npanies, as well as other corporate and private custom-\\ners. In order to identify credit risks, the Mercedes- Benz \\nGroup assesses the creditworthiness of customers. The \\nMercedes- Benz Group  manages its credit risk from \\ntrade receivables using appropriate IT applications and \\ndatabases on the basis of internal policies which have \\nto be followed Group- wide.  \\nA significant proportion of the trade receivables from \\neach country’s domestic business is secured by various \\ncountry -specific types of collateral. This collateral in-\\ncludes conditional sales, guarantees and sureties, as \\nwell as mortgages and deposits from customers.  \\nFor trade receivables from the export business, the \\nMercedes- Benz Group  also evaluates its customers’  \\ncreditworthiness by means of an internal rating process \\nwith consideration of the respective country risk. In this context, the Annual F inancial Statements and \\nother relevant information on the general distribution \\ncompanies , such as payment history , are used and \\nassessed.  \\nDepending on the creditworthiness of the customers , \\nthe Mercedes- Benz Group  establishes credit limits and \\nlimits credit risks with the following types of collateral:  \\n- credit insurances,  \\n- first- class bank guarantees and \\n- letters of credit.  \\nThese procedures are defined in the export credit \\nguidelines, which have Group -wide validity.  \\nFor impairments of trade receivables , the simplified \\napproach is applied, according to which these receiva-\\nbles are allocated to stage 2. Credit losses  until maturi-\\nty for thes e trade receivables are recogniz ed upon \\ninitial recognition.  \\nFurther information on trade receivables and th e status \\nof loss allowances recogniz ed is provided in Note 19.'),\n",

The Mercedes- Benz Group  manages its \\ncredit risk exposure in connection with derivative fi-\\nnancial instruments through a limit system, which is \\nbased on the review of each counterparty’s financial \\nstrength. This system limits and diversifies the credit \\nrisk. As a result, the Mercedes- Benz Group  is exposed \\nto credit risk only to a small extent with respect to its \\nderivative financial instruments. In accordance with the \\nGroup’s risk policy, most derivatives are contracted \\nwith counterparties which have an external rating of \\n“A” or better.  \\nOther receivables and financial assets  \\nThe Mercedes -Benz Group is exposed to credit risk \\nonly to a small extent with respect to other receivables \\nand financial assets included i n other financial assets in \\n2023 and 2022.  Irrevocable loan commitments  \\nThe Mercedes -Benz Mobility  segment in particular is \\nexposed to credit risk from irrevocable loan commit-\\nments to end customers  and retailers. At 31 December \\n2023, irrevocable loan commitments amounted to  \\n€2,476  million (2022:  €3,234 million). These loan com-\\nmitments  had a maturity of less than one year  and are \\nnot subject to a material credit risk based on the cur-\\nrent state of knowledge.  \\nFinancial guarantees \\nThe maximum potential obligations resulting from fi-\\nnancial guarantees amounted to €284 million at 31 \\nDecember  2023 (2022:  €551 million ) and include d lia-\\nbilities rec ogniz ed at 31 December  2023 in the amount \\nof €4 million (2022:  €7 million) . Financial guarantees \\nrepresent contractual  arrangements. These guarantees \\ngenerally provide that in the event of default or non -\\npayment by the primary debtor, the Group will be re-\\nquired to settle such financial obligations  generally up \\nto a contractually agreed amount.  Country risk \\nCountry risk is the risk of economic loss arising from \\nchanges of political, economic, legal  or social condi-\\ntions in the respective country, e.g. resulting from sov-\\nereign measures such as expropriation or interdiction \\nof foreign currency transfers.  \\nThe Mercedes- Benz Group  is exposed to country risk \\nmainly resulting from cross -border funding or collat-\\neralization  of Group companies and customers,  from \\ninvestments in Group companies, associated compa-\\nnies, joint ventures and joint operations as well as from \\ncross -border trade receivables . Country risks also arise \\nfrom cross -border cash deposits at financial institu-\\ntions.  \\nThe Mercedes- Benz Group  manages these risks via \\ncountry exposure limits (e.g. for hard currency portfoli-\\nos of financial services entities). An internal rating sys-\\ntem serves as a basis for the Mercedes -Benz Group ’s \\nrisk- oriented country exposure management; it assigns \\nall countries to risk classes, with consideration of both \\nexternal ratings and capital market indications of coun-\\ntry risks.'),\n",

Liquid assets com-\\nprise cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt \\nsecurities and similar investments. The Group can dis-\\npose of these liquid assets at short notice.  \\nInsofar as reverse factoring agreements are entered \\ninto, they have no influence on the liquidity risk of the \\nMercedes- Benz Group, as they relate to a large number \\nof investors and have no impact  on the payment terms \\nof the trade payables concerned.  \\nThe funds raised are used to finance working capital \\nand capital expenditure as wel l as the cash needs of \\nthe leasing and sales -financing business and unex-\\npected liquidity needs. In accordance with internal \\npolicies , the refunding of the leas ing and sales -\\nfinancing business is generally carried out with match-\\ning maturities so that financing liabilities have the same \\nmaturity profile as the equipment on operating leases \\nand the receivables from financial services.  At 31 December  2023, the liquidity of the Mercedes-\\nBenz Group  amounted to €22.8  billion  (2022: \\n€24.7 billion ). In 2023, significant cash inflows resulted \\nfrom  the business of the Mercedes -Benz Cars and Mer-\\ncedes- Benz Vans segments. Furthermore, dividends \\nreceived from Daimler Truck Holding AG and Beijing \\nBenz Automotive Co., Ltd. in particular had a positive \\neffect on liquidity. Cash outflows resulted in particular \\nfrom investments in intangible assets and property, \\nplant and equipment,  income taxes paid, the dividend \\npayment to the shareholders of Mercedes -Benz Group \\nAG and payments made as part of the share buyback \\nprogramme. Moreover, there were negative effects \\nfrom the leasing and sales financing business at Mer-\\ncedes- Benz Mobility.  \\nFrom an operating point of view, the management of \\nthe Group’s liquidity exposures  is centralized by a daily \\ncash- pooling process. This process enables the Mer-\\ncedes- Benz Group  to manage its liquidity surplus and \\nliquidity requirements according to the actual needs of \\nthe Group and of the companies of the Group . The \\nGroup’s short -term and mid -term liquidity management \\ntakes into account the maturities of financial assets \\nand financial liabilities and estimates of cash flows \\nfrom business  operations.  In general, the Mercedes- Benz Group  makes use of a \\nbroad spectrum of financial instruments to cover its \\nfunding requirements. Depending on funding require-\\nments and market conditions, the Mercedes- Benz \\nGroup  issues commercial papers, bonds (including \\ngreen bonds), debt obligations and financial instru-\\nments secured by receivables in various currencies. \\nBank credit facilities are also used to cover financing \\nrequirements. Potential downgrades of the Mercedes -\\nBenz Group’s credit ratings could have a negative im-\\npact on the Group’s financing. Since July 2018, the \\nMercedes- Benz Group  has had at its disposal a syndi-\\ncated credit facility  with a volume of € 11 billion from a \\nconsortium of international banks. It grants the Mer-\\ncedes- Benz Group additional financial flexibility until \\n2025. The credit line was unused as of 31 December \\n2023.  In addition, customer deposits at Mercedes -Benz \\nBank are used as a further source of refinancing. \\nInformation on the Group’s financing liabilities is also \\nprovided in Note 24.'),\n",

The Group is also exposed to equity price risk in \\nconnection with its investments in listed com panies.  \\nThe Mercedes -Benz Group manages market risks to \\nminimize the impact of fluctuations in foreign ex-\\nchange -rates and interest rates on the earnings  of the \\nGroup and its segments. The Group calculates its over-\\nall net -exposure to these market risks to provide the \\nbasis for hedging decisions, which include the selection \\nof hedging instruments and the determination of hedg-\\ning volumes and the corresponding periods. The hedg-\\ning strategy is specified at Group level and uniformly \\nimplemented in the segments. Decisions regarding , for \\nexample, currencies and asset -liability management \\n(interest rates) a re made by a committee  that meets \\nregularly.  Net-exposures are the basis for  the hedging \\nstrategies and are updated regular ly. The Mercedes -\\nBenz Group  usually counter acts the risk of  short -term \\nfluctuations in raw -material prices by means of price \\nescalation clauses in the supply contracts. Power pur-\\nchase agreements are also concluded to reduce elec-\\ntricity price risks. Power purchase agreements are pur-\\nchase agreements for energy needs, including fixed \\npurchase prices of the electricity generated by a spe-\\ncific plant for generating wind or solar power.  Certain existing benchmark interest rates including \\nthose of the London Interbank Offered Rate (for USD, \\nGBP, CHF and JPY) were comprehensively and interna-\\ntionally reformed. As a result, those interest rates were \\ngradually abolished and replaced with alternative risk-\\nfree reference rates. Alternative interest rates were \\ndeveloped on a national level in the context of the \\nrespective legal systems and currencies; they can \\ntherefore vary with regard to their structure, method-\\nology and period of publication.  \\nAs the reform for EURIBOR and USD, GBP, CHF and JPY \\nLIBOR has already been implemented, the contractual \\nadjustment of financial instruments has already been \\nmade in line with a corresponding interest rate refer-\\nence.  \\nThe conversion of the outstanding reference rates of \\nhedging instruments and their underlying transactions \\nwas identical and without any material delay. The Mer-\\ncedes- Benz Group considered the economic relation-\\nship and thus the continuation of hedge accounting to \\nbe still existing as of 31 December 2022.  The nominal values of those hedging instruments  that \\nwere affected in the prior year and are included in a \\nhedging relationship can be found in table Nominal \\namounts of derivative financial instruments used in \\nhedge accounting in Note 32.  \\nThe effect of the application of the new interest rates \\non the Consolidated Financial Statements is being re-\\nviewed on an ongoing basis. In order to conduct finan-\\ncial transactions based on the new indices, the Mer-\\ncedes- Benz Group  is preparing its relevant IT- systems \\naccordingly. Uncertainty still exists about future market \\nstandards with interest conventions for individual fi-\\nnancial products (cash products and interest deriva-\\ntives) that reference the new risk -free ra tes. Contracts \\nnot yet converted as part of the IBOR reform in the \\nprevious year (USD LIBOR) amounted to €4,790 million \\nin financial liabilities and € 9,258 million in derivatives \\nas of 31 December 2022.  \\nAs part of its risk management system, the Mercedes-\\nBenz Group  employs value- at-risk analyses. In per-\\nforming these analyses, the Mercedes- Benz Group  \\nquantifies its market risk due to changes in foreign \\ncurrency exchange -rates and interest rates and certain \\ncommodity prices on a regular basis by predicting the \\npotential loss over a target time horizon (holding peri-\\nod) and confidence level.'),\n",

The value -at-risk calculation method for com-\\nmodity hedging instruments is based on a Monte Carlo \\nsimulation.  \\nWhen calculating value at risk using the variance -\\ncovariance approach, the Mercedes- Benz Group  first \\ncomputes the current market value of the Group’s fi-\\nnancial instruments portfolio. Then the sensitivity of \\nthe portfolio value to changes in the relevant market \\nrisk factors, such as particular foreign currency ex-\\nchange -rates or interest rates of specific maturities, is \\nquantified. Based on volatilities and correlations of \\nthese market risk factors, which are obtained from the \\nRiskMetrics ™ dataset, a statistical distribution of po-\\ntential changes in the portfolio value at the end of the \\nholding period is computed. The loss which is reached \\nor exceeded with a probability of only 1% can be de-\\nrived from this calculation and represents the value at \\nrisk.The Monte Carlo simulation uses random numbers to \\ngenerate possible changes in market risk factors con-\\nsistent with current market volatilities . The changes in \\nmarket risk factors allow the calculation of a  possible \\nchange in the portfolio value  over the holding period . \\nRunning multiple iterations of this simulation leads to a \\ndistribution of portfolio value changes. The value at risk \\ncan be determined based on this distribution as the \\nportfolio value loss which is reached or  exceeded with \\na probability of  1%. \\nExchange- rate risk \\nTransaction risk and currency r isk management \\nThe global nature of the Mercedes -Benz Group’s busi-\\nnesses exposes cash flows to risks arising from fluctua-\\ntions in exchange- rates. These risks primarily relate to \\nfluctuations between the euro and the US dollar, the \\nChinese renminbi, the British pound and other curren-\\ncies such as currencies of growth markets. In the oper-\\nating vehicle business, the Group’s exchange -rate risk \\nprimarily arises when revenue is generated in a curren-\\ncy that is different from the currency in which the  costs \\nof revenue are incurred (transaction risk). It may be \\ninadequate to cover the costs if the value of the cur-\\nrency in which the revenue is generated declined in the \\ninterim relative to the value of the currency in which \\nthe costs were  incurred . The risk exposures serve as a \\nbasis for analysing exchange -rate risks at Group level. \\nIn addition, the Group is indirectly exposed to a trans-\\naction risk from its equity- method investments.  The Group’s overall currency exposure is reduced  by \\nnatur al hedging , which consists of the currency expo-\\nsures of the business  operations of different entities \\nand segments partially  offsetting  each other at Group \\nlevel. These natural hedges eliminate the need for \\nhedging to the extent of the matched exposures. To \\nprovide an additional natural hedge against any re-\\nmaining transaction risk exposure, the Mercedes- Benz \\nGroup  generally strives to increase cash outflows in the \\nsame currencies in which the Group has a net excess \\ninflow.  \\nIn order to mitigate the im pact of currency exchange -\\nrate fluctuations for the business  operations (future \\ntransactions), the Mercedes -Benz Group  continually \\nassesses its exposure to exchange -rate risks and hedg-\\nes a portion of those risks by using derivative financial \\ninstruments. A committee manages the Group’s ex-\\nchange -rate risk and its hedging transactions through \\ncurrency derivatives. The committee consists of repre-\\nsentatives of the relevant segments and corporate  \\nfunctions. The Corporate Treasury department aggre-\\ngates  foreign currency exposures from the companies \\nof the Group and the operational  units and implements  \\nthe committee’s  decisions concerning foreign currency \\nhedging through transactions with international finan-\\ncial institutions.  Suitable measures are generally taken \\nwithout delay to eliminate any o ver-hedging regarding \\nhedging transactions caused by changes in exposure. \\nMoreover, designated hedging relationships are re-\\nviewed with respect to any requirements to discon-\\ntinue hedge accounting.'),\n",

Depending on \\nthe nature of the underlying risks, the hedging rates \\ndecrease the further the expected cash flows are in the \\nfuture. On the one hand, the hedging horizon is natural-\\nly limited by uncertainty related to cash flows that lie \\nfar in the future; on the other hand, it may also be lim-\\nited by the fact that appropriate currency contracts are \\nnot available. This step-by-step method aims to limit \\nrisks for the Group  from unfavou rable movements in \\nexchange- rates while preserving sufficient flexibility to \\nparticipate in favo urable developments. Based on this \\nstep-by-step method and depending on the market \\noutlook, the committee  determines the hedging hori-\\nzon, which usually varies from one to five years, as well \\nas the average hedge ratios. At the end of 2023 , the \\ncurrency management for calendar year 2024 showed \\nan unhedged position in the automotive business of \\n35% of the underlying forecasted cash flows in US \\ndollars and an unhedged position of 29% of the under-\\nlying for ecast cash flows in Br itish pounds, while the \\nforecast cash flows in Chinese renminbi were almost \\nfully hedged with an unhedged position of 4%.  \\nTo cover foreign currency exposure risks of the vehicle \\nbusiness  operations forward foreign exchange con-\\ntracts and currency options  are primarily used . The \\nMercedes- Benz Group ’s policies call for a mixture of \\nthese financial  instruments depending on the assess-\\nment of market conditions. Value at risk is used to measure the exchange- rate risk inherent in these de-\\nrivative financial instruments.  \\nThe following t able shows the period- end, high, low \\nand average value -at-risk figures of the exchange -rate \\nrisks  for the 2023 and 2022 portfolios of derivative \\nfinancial instruments, which were entered into primari-\\nly in connection with the vehicle business operations \\nand the trade receivables and payables existing at the \\nend of quarter . Average exposure has been computed \\non an end -of-quarter basis. The other transactions \\nunderlying the derivative financial instruments are not \\nincluded in the following value -at-risk presentation, \\nsince they comprise forecast cash  flows. See also table \\nNominal amounts of derivative financial instruments \\nused in hedge accounting in Note 32.Hedge accounting  \\nWhen designating derivative financial instruments, a \\nhedge ratio of 1 is applied. In addition, the respective \\nvolume and currency of the hedge and the underlying \\ntransaction as well as maturity dates are matched. The \\nGroup ensures an economic relationship between the \\nunderlying transaction and the hedging instrument by \\nensuring consistency of currency, volume and maturity. \\nOption premiums and also forward components are not \\ndesignated into the hedging relationship, but the hedg-\\ning costs are deferred in other comprehensive income \\nand recognized in profit or loss at the due date of the \\nunderlying transaction or recognized as adjustment of \\nacquisition cost of non -financial assets. The effective-\\nness of the hedge is assessed at the start of and during \\nthe hedging relationship. Possible sources of ineffec-\\ntiveness of the hedging relationship are:  \\n- Changes in the credit risk on the measurement of the \\nused hedging instrument which are not reflected in \\nthe change of the hedged currency risk. \\n- Changes in the timing of the hedged transactions.'),\n",

However, the majority of \\ninterest rate sensitive assets and liabilities results from \\nthe financial services business operated by Mercedes-\\nBenz  Mobility . The Mercedes- Benz  Mobility  companies \\nenter into transactions with customers that primarily \\nresult in fixed -rate receivables. The Mercedes -Benz \\nGroup ’s general policy is to match  the refinancing of \\ninterest -bearing assets in terms of maturities and in-\\nterest rates wherever economically feasible. However, \\nfor a  narrowly  limited portion of the receivables portfo-\\nlio in selected and developed markets, Mercedes- Benz \\nMobility  does not match refinancing in terms of maturi-\\nties in order to take advantage of market opportunities. \\nThis r esult s in the Mercedes- Benz Group being e x-\\nposed to  interest  rate risks.  \\nA committee  consisting of representatives of the rele-\\nvant segments and the c orporate functions manages \\nthe interest rate risk by setting targets for the interest \\nrate risk position. The Corporate Treasury department \\nand the local Mercedes- Benz Group companies are \\njointly responsible for achieving these targets. As sepa-\\nrate functions, the Treasury Controlling  and the Mer-\\ncedes- Benz  Mobility  Controlling & Reporting depart-\\nment monitor target achievement on a monthly basis. \\nIn order to achieve the targeted interest rate risk posi-\\ntions in terms of maturities and interest rate fixing \\nperiods, the Mercedes -Benz Group  also uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps. The \\ninterest rate risk position is assessed by comparing \\nassets and liabilities for corresponding maturities, in-\\ncluding the impact of the relevant derivative financial \\ninstruments.  \\nDerivative financial instruments are also used in con-\\njunction with the refinancing related to the automotive \\nsegments and liquidity management.  The Mercedes-\\nBenz Group  steers  the funding activities of the automo-\\ntive segments a nd the financial services business at \\nGroup level.  \\nThe t able Value at risk for exchange risk, interest  rate \\nrisk and commodity price risk shows the period -end, \\nhigh, low and average value -at-risk figures of the inter-\\nest rate risk for  the 2023 and 2022 portfolio s of inter-\\nest rate sensitive primary financial instruments and \\nderivative financial instruments of the Group, including \\nthe financial instruments of the financial services busi-\\nness.

A verage \\nexposure has been computed on an end- of-quarter \\nbasis. \\nIn the course of 2023, changes in the value at risk of \\ninterest rate sensitive financial instruments were pri-\\nmarily determined by the development of interest rate \\nvolatilities.  Hedge accounting   \\nWhen designating derivative hedging instruments, the \\nMercedes- Benz Group generally applies a hedge ratio \\nof 1.

Capital management  \\nNet assets and value added  represent the basis for \\ncapital management at the Mercedes -Benz Group . Alt-\\nhough individual companies in the Mercedes -Benz \\nMobility segment are subject to the capital require-\\nments of the respective banking supervision, Mer-\\ncedes- Benz Group AG is not subject to external mini-\\nmum capital requirements.  \\nThe assets and liabilities of the segments in accord-\\nance with IFRS provide the basis for the determination \\nof net assets at Group level. Mercedes- Benz Cars and \\nMercedes- Benz Vans are accountable for the  net oper-\\nating assets; all assets, liabilities and prov isions for \\nwhich they are  responsible for in day -to-day operations \\nare therefore allocated to them . Performance meas-\\nurement at Mercedes- Benz  Mobility  is on an equity \\nbasis, in line with the usual practice in the banking \\nbusiness. Net assets at Group level additionally include \\nassets and liabilities from income taxes as well as other \\ncorporate items and eliminations.  \\nAverage annual net assets are calculated on the basis \\nof average quarterly net assets. The average quarterly \\nnet assets are calculated as an average of the net as-\\nsets at the beginning and the end of the qua rter. \\n Average net assets  \\n  2023  2022  \\nIn millions of euros    \\n   \\nMercedes -Benz Cars  41,407 38,189 \\nMercedes- Benz Vans  1,253 885 \\nMercedes -Benz Mobility1 13,774 14,466 \\nNet assets of the segments  56,434 53,540 \\nEquity -method investment  \\nin DTHAG  8,221 8,078 \\nOther equity -method  \\ninvestments2 253 303 \\nAssets and liabilities  \\nfrom income taxes3 -5,159 -3,818 \\nOther corporate items  \\nand eliminations3 94 422 \\nNet assets of the Mercedes -Benz Group  59,843 58,525 \\n1 Equity.  \\n2  Unless allocated to the segments.  \\n3 To the extent not allocated  to Mercedes-Benz Mobility. The cost of capital of the Group’s average net assets is \\nreflected in value added. Value added shows the extent \\nto which the Group achieves or exceeds the minimum \\nreturn requirements of the shareholders, thus creating \\nadditional value. The required rate of return on net \\nassets, and thus the cost of capital  rate, is derived from \\nthe minimum rates of return that equity investors and \\nlenders  expect on their invested capital. In the report-\\ning year , the cost of capital rate used for the  internal \\ncapital management amounted to 9% after taxes.  \\nThe objective of capital management is to increase \\nvalue added , among other things , by optimi zing the \\ncost of capital. This is achieved on the one hand by \\noptimizing the net assets, e.g. w orking capital , which is \\nwithin the operational responsibility of the segments. \\nIn addition, taking into account legal regulations, the \\nMercedes- Benz Group strives to optimize the costs and \\nrisks of its capital structure , and consequently, the cost \\nof capital rate. An e xample of this i s an appropriate \\nlevel of liquidity, oriented towards the operational re-\\nquirements.'),\n",

The spin off and \\nhive-down of the Daimler commercial vehicle business  \\nin 2021 resulted in a subsequent liability relationship \\noutside the Group . \\nThe stipulations  existing in this context, in particular  on \\nthe procedure for regulating the internal settlements \\nbetween the participating legal entities, are laid down  \\nin the hive -down agreement of 25 March 2019. The aforementioned period is ten years for pension \\nobligations based on the German Company Pensions \\nAct (BetrAVG) that existed before the hive -down took \\neffect. Mercedes -Benz Group AG and Mercedes- Benz \\nAG do not expect any outflow of liquidity from the re-\\nspective other legal entity due to the plan  assets  being \\navailable in a sufficient volume.  \\nAccording to the current appraisal, an actual claim with \\nrespect to the subsequent liability relationship  be-\\ntween the entities  is considered to be unlikely.'),\n",

We believe that the evidence we \\nhave obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a \\nbasis for our opinions on the consolidated financial \\nstatements and on the combined management report.Note on the emphasis of a particular matter\\nWe refer to the comments of the legal representatives \\nin the section on “EU taxonomy” in the section entitled \\n“non-financial statement” that is included in the com-\\nbined management report in accordance with Sec -\\ntions\\xa0289b paragraph\\xa01, 289c, 315b paragraph\\xa01 and \\n315c HGB.

In this connec -\\ntion, we in particular critically reviewed the main influ-\\nencing factors, such as the expected number of returns \\nfrom leasing, the current marketing results in order to \\nassess the accuracy of the estimates and future vehicle \\nmodel changes.

The loss \\nallowances on these receivables amounted at the \\nreporting date to €\\xa01,055 million.\\nThe calculation of the loss allowances is based on \\nexpected credit losses and therefore also includes \\nexpectations regarding the future. Recognition of the \\nexpected credit losses is carried out by means of a \\nthree-parameter procedure for the determination of \\nloss allowances. At the same time, various factors \\ndetermining the value, such as the determination of \\nstatistical default probabilities and loss rates, the possible amount receivable on default, the parameter \\ntransfer criteria that are related to a significant change \\nin the default risk of borrowers, and the calculation of \\nfuture cash flows. Furthermore, macroeconomic sce-\\nnarios (basis scenarios, optimistic and pessimistic sce-\\nnarios) flow into the calculation, the identification of \\nwhich to a high degree includes discretionary judge-\\nments and uncertainties. The risk for the financial state-\\nments is that the creditworthiness of customers and \\nfuture cash flows is misjudged or that the calculation of \\nthe risk provision parameters is incorrect so that loss \\nallowances are not recognised or are insufficient.\\nOur audit approach\\nWe obtained a comprehensive understanding of the \\ndevelopment of the portfolios, the associated counter -\\nparty default risks and the processes for identifying, \\nmanaging, monitoring and measuring credit risks by \\ninspecting analyses and risk reports, interrogations, \\nreview of guidelines and working instructions, checking \\nthe defined methods and their implementation and \\nchecking and walking through the validation process \\nand the individual validation reports.\\nWe audited the appropriateness and effectiveness of \\nthe internal control system in relation to the risk models \\nas well as the determination of the value-determining \\nfactors and the valuation allowances, also in part \\nthrough recalculation.

against mercedes \\nbenz group ag in israel in february  as well as \\nagainst mercedes benz group ag and further group \\ncompanies in the united kingdom since may  in \\nthe netherlands since june

large number of customers of diesel \\nvehicles have filed lawsuits for damages or rescission \\nof sales contracts. they assert that the vehicles con\\ntained illegal defeat devices andor showed
