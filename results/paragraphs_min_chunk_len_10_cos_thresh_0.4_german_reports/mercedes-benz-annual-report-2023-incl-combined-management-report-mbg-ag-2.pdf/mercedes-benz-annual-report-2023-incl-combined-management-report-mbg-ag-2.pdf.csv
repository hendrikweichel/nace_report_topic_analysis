174,Profit measureThe measure of operating profit at the divisional level is EBIT earnings before interest and income taxes. EBIT thus reflects the divisions responsibility for profit and loss. EBIT that is calculated at the Group level takes into account centrally managed matters and eliminations.In order to provide a more transparent presentation of our ongoing business adjusted EBIT is also calculated and reported for both the Group and the divisions. The adjustments include individual items insofar as they lead to material effects in a reporting year. These individual items can relate in particular to legal proceedings and related measures restructuring measures and MA transactions. Group EBIT minus the centrally managed income taxes equals net operating profit. The chapter Profitability shows how net operating profit is calculated. Return on salesAs one of the main factors influencing value added return on sales is of particular importance for assessing the profitability of the automotive divisions. Return on sales is the ratio of EBIT to revenue and vehicle sales are the primary source of revenue. The measure of profitability for MercedesBenz Mobility is not return on sales but return on equity the ratio of EBIT to average equity on a quarterly basis. On the basis of adjusted EBIT an adjusted return on sales is reported for the automotive divisions and an adjusted return on equity is reported for MercedesBenz Mobility.Net assetsAll assets liabilities and provisions for which the automotive divisions are responsible in daytoday operations are allocated to them. Performance measurement at MercedesBenz Mobility is implemented on an equity basis. Net assets at the Group level include the net operating assets of the automotive divisions and the equity of MercedesBenz Mobility as well as assets and liabilities from income taxes and other reconciling items which are not allocated to the divisions. The average annual net assets are calculated on the basis of the average quarterly net assets. Cash flowA change in net assets for example as a result of investments generally leads to the application or release of liquid funds. Along with earnings net assets thus also have a direct effect on the cash flow. Of outstanding importance for the financial strength of the MercedesBenz Group is the free cash flow of the industrial business which comprises the cash flows at the automotive divisions and the cash flows from interest taxes and other reconciling items that cannot be allocated to the divisions. The operating cash flow before interest and taxes CFBIT for the automotive divisions is derived from EBIT and the change in net assets. The cash conversion rate CCR is the ratio of CFBIT to EBIT over a period of time and is an important measure for cashflow management at the automotive divisions. In order to provide a more transparent presentation of our ongoing business the adjusted free cash flow of the industrial business and the adjusted CFBIT of the automotive divisions are also calculated and reported. An adjusted cash conversion rate adjusted CCR on the basis of adjusted CFBIT and adjusted EBIT is presented for the automotive divisions. The adjustments include individual items insofar as they lead to material effects in a reporting year. These individual items can relate in particular to legal proceedings and related measures restructuring measures and MA transactions. ,,,,,,,0.42448852751165833,,,,,,,0.3663372947573274,,,,,

268,Annual Report MercedesBenz GroupManagement of pension assets plan assets includes the investment of the assets to cover the corresponding pension obligations. The plan assets are legally separated from the Groups assets and are invested primarily in funds they are not available for general business purposes. The plan assets are spread across a broad range of investment categories such as equities fixedinterest securities alternative investments and real estate depending on the expected development of pension obligations and with the help of riskreturn optimization. The performance of the asset management is measured by comparison with defined benchmark indices. The investment risks are limited via a Groupwide policy. In addition there are local regulations for risk management for the individual plan assets. Additional information on pension plans and similar obligations is provided in Note of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The risk volume that is subject to credit risk management includes the MercedesBenz Groups worldwide creditor positions with financial institutions issuers of securities and customers in the financial services business as well as trade receivables. Credit risks with financial institutions and issuers of securities arise primarily from investments executed as part of our liquidity management and from the application of derivative financial instruments. The management of these credit risks is mainly based on an internal limit system that reflects the creditworthiness of the respective financial institution or issuer. The credit risk with customers of the automotive business results from relationships with contracted dealerships and general agencies other corporate customers and retail customers. In connection with the export business general agencies that according to the creditworthiness analyses are not sufficiently creditworthy are generally required to provide collaterals such as firstclass bank guarantees. The credit risk with end customers in the financial services business is managed by MercedesBenz Mobility on the basis of a standardized riskmanagement process. In this process minimum requirements are defined for the salesfinancing and leasing business and standards are set for credit processes as well as for the identification measurement and management of risks. Key elements for the management of credit risks are appropriate creditworthiness assessments supported by statistical riskclassification methods as well as structured portfolio analysis and portfolio monitoring. Financial country risk management includes various aspects the risk from investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures the risk from the crossborder financing of Group companies in highrisk countries and the risk from direct sales to customers in those countries. The Group has an internal rating system that assigns the countries in which it operates to risk categories. Risks from crossborder receivables are partially protected with the use of letters of credit and bank guarantees in favour of MercedesBenz Group AG and other Group companies.

277,The cash flows from acquisitions and sales of marketable debt securities and similar investments included in cash flows from investing activities are deducted as those securities are allocated to liquidity and changes in them are thus not a part of the free cash flow of the industrial business. On the other hand effects in connection with the recognition and measurement of rightofuse assets which result from lessee accounting and are largely noncash items are included in the free cash flow of the industrial business. Other adjustments relate to effects from the financing of the Groups own dealerships and effects from internal deposits within the Group. In addition the calculation of the free cash flow of the industrial business includes the cash flows to be shown under cash flow from financing activities in connection with the acquisition or disposal of interests in subsidiaries without loss of control.In the free cash flow of the industrial business amounted to . billion and was thus higher than the previous years figure of . billion.The increase in the free cash flow of the industrial business by . billion to . billion compared to the previous year is characterized by an improvement in profit before income taxes of the industrial business. During the reporting period a positive effect resulted from the development of the working capital mainly due to a lower inventory buildup and a decrease in the trade receivables compared to the previous year. A smaller increase in trade payables compared to the previous year had an opposing effect.In the previous year the free cash flow was also impacted by higher payments resulting from the settlement of civil and environmental claims made by several US authorities in in connection with emission control systems used in certain diesel vehicles as well as higher payments in connection with restructuring measures. Another positive effect resulted from a lower increase in the number of leased vehicles compared to the previous year. Moreover higher dividend payments were received during the reporting period from equitymethod investments in particular Daimler Truck Holding AG and Beijing Benz Automotive Co. Ltd. Investments in and disposals of shareholdings and other business operations resulted in slightly higher cash inflows in the reporting period than in the previous year.There was an increase in income taxes paid in comparison to the prior year which resulted from the improvement in earnings before taxes in the industrial business. In addition to payments to the tax authorities income tax payments also include intraGroup payments and refunds based on contractual arrangements within the tax groups. A further negative effect on the free cash flow of the industrial business resulted from the higher investment in intangible assets and capital expenditure on property plant and equipment.,,0.3362801419520889,0.3637717839586194,0.31541652672789294,0.3699322151460278,0.307523002267683,0.45808426959997717,0.37746419560442435,,0.31862810614226106,,,,,,,,,

343,Annual Report MercedesBenz GroupThe Group tax strategy drawn up by the Board of Management of MercedesBenz Group AG defines the framework of action here and this strategy is further specified and implemented by means of organizational and contentrelated policies guidelines and instructions. The tax strategy is regularly reviewed for appropriate adjustments.The tax policies define the responsibilities tasks and obligations of those individuals in the Group who deal with tax issues and also contain specific provisions for ensuring that legal requirements are met. Management is kept informed about relevant tax issues by means of monthly reports and regular communications as well as when required. Moreover it is involved in compliance processes	 Regular communication between CFO and Head of Taxes	 Regular information to the Supervisory Board on risks and opportunities as well as current regulatory issuesThe Code of Conduct stipulates that all intentional violations of external andor internal tax guidelines must be reported and investigated. The same applies to any failure to make corrections to procedures performed in an erroneous manner as outlined in our internally valid Treatment of Violations Policy. Further information can be found in the Integrity and Compliance chapter.The MercedesBenz Group has established a Tax Compliance Management System Tax CMS in order to ensure effective tax compliance throughout the Group. The Tax CMS is a separate subunit of the general intraGroup Compliance Management System. The Tax CMS also operates an active taxrisk management system that is consistently applied throughout the Group in order to monitor and check whether tax obligations are being fulfilled and also to support those responsible for ensuring such fulfilment. Another goal here is to identify and reduce tax risks at the Group and thus the associated personal risks that may be faced by the employees active in this area. The system includes numerous measures  for example continuous monitoring of tax risks and the incorporation of tax risk issues into the internal control system and the Groupwide risk management process in line with the companys risk management policy. Based on the Code of Conduct the MercedesBenz Group did not become aware of any material violations during the reporting year.Sustainability in the supply chainThe MercedesBenz Group is committed to the responsible procurement of production materials nonproduction materials and services. The Group has incorporated the guidelines for sustainable supply chain management into the Responsible Sourcing Standards RSS. These are contractually stipulated with direct suppliers and are applied worldwide. The goal here is to prevent minimize or if possible put a stop to any negative effects on human rights worldwide. The RSS define the minimum requirements for suppliers. They are already used as a basis for the tendering process for suppliers of production materials. The RSS require direct suppliers to communicate the RSS provisions to their own employees and to their direct suppliers and ensure that the RSS are complied with in their business processes and in the areas in which they exert an influence. Suppliers are to conserve natural resources and avoid environmental damage repair any damage that does occur and compensate for such damage that cannot be avoided or repaired.Measures in the supply chainThe MercedesBenz Group uses a variety of measures and concepts to ensure the fulfilment of its due diligence obligations in the supply chain. This includes training preventive and corrective measures risk analyses documentation for tracking and reporting purposes and effectiveness checks. The MercedesBenz Group uses these tools in order to increase the transparency of the supply chain and ensures that the internationally recognized human rights are upheld by business partners as well and that other social standards and environmental requirements are met. The procurement units for production materials nonproduction materials and services play a key role here.

404,The supply chain also plays an important role in efforts to conserve resources. The MercedesBenz Group wants to decouple resource consumption from economic growth. To achieve this goal it is relying on the support of its suppliers. With their help the Group wants to continuously increase the proportion of secondary and renewable materials in its vehicles. Plastics steel and aluminium have been identified as particularly important such materials in MercedesBenz vehicles. We need large volumes of these materials for the production of our vehicles and their extraction and processing also consume large amounts of energy and resources. Plastics and recyclates throughout their entire life cycles vehicles from the MercedesBenz brand are in future to be more environmentally friendly and less resourceintensive than before. The cornerstones of this approach involve the use of recyclates and lightweight materials as well as recyclability. MercedesBenz Group requirement specifications already define a minimum proportion of recycled material for each component in new MercedesBenz cars. This proportion varies depending on the vehicle model and series in question. As part of its sustainable business strategy the MercedesBenz Group also relies on the use of natural fibres and textiles as a means of replacing conventional plastics with renewable raw materials.Steel The use of secondary materials such as steel scrap can reduce primary resource requirements in line with a circular economy. For example MercedesBenz AG and its partner therefore ensure the recycling of scrap steel from the MercedesBenz Cars plant in Sindelfingen Germany.Aluminium MercedesBenz Cars and MercedesBenz Vans already use recycled materials including recycled aluminium in numerous seriesproduction vehicles. Aluminium is a light metal that can be recycled without any loss of quality and the recycling process for aluminium uses less energy than would be required to produce new aluminium. In order to continue increasing its use of recycled materials MercedesBenz AG is working with its suppliers to develop aluminium alloys with high endoflife scrap potential from old vehicles or packaging for example. In addition by amending existing supply agreements MercedesBenz AG and its suppliers continued to work on the decarbonization of the aluminium supply chain for all of their production operations in Europe. At least one third of the primary aluminium that will be used for new electric models in Europe is to be produced using energy from renewable sources.In secondary material targets were defined for MercedesBenz Cars and MercedesBenz Vans and these were then firmly incorporated into the requirements for contract awards. In the reporting year the Company carried out a model seriesspecific analysis at component level in order to realize further potential for increasing secondary materials. Project milestones and the status of projects with regard to the use of secondary materials are presented on a quarterly basis in the executive bodies for the various model series. The responsible member of the Board of Management of MercedesBenz Cars and the responsible executive management team member of MercedesBenz Vans are also provided with information on a regular basis within the framework of the activities of a committee that manages strategic sustainability matters. With its Responsible Sourcing Standards the MercedesBenz Group has also defined other environmental requirements in its supplier agreements. Further information can be found in the Sustainability in the supply chain section.Suppliers of production materials to MercedesBenz Cars and MercedesBenz Vans are expected to operate with an environmental management system that is certified according to ISO or EMAS. Depending on the specific risks this also applies to suppliers of nonproduction materials and services.MercedesBenz Cars and MercedesBenz Vans are also cooperating with organizations such as CDP formerly Carbon Disclosure Project so that they can depict the environmental impact of their supply chains even more transparently.

431,The increasing demand for mobility is also leading to an increase in the worldwide consumption of resources with effects on the environment and society. Thats why the goal of the MercedesBenz Group is to increasingly decouple its consumption of resources from the growth of its production volume. The consumption of resources in production plays an important role in the environmental compatibility of vehicles. For this reason the MercedesBenz Group is working continuously to make production more efficient and more environmentally compatible. In order to improve its environmental footprint in production operations the Group has set reduction targets for energy water and waste at all of its production sites worldwide.In order to achieve its goals the Group uses Groupwide resource management with its environmental and energy management systems to ensure that appropriate measures are developed adapted to challenges where necessary and monitored.In order to ensure efficient highquality and environmentally friendly manufacturing operations the Group has established an environmental management system certified in accordance with ISO at its production sites around the world. All German manufacturing locations and the two European production sites in Kecskemt Hungary and Vitoria Spain have also been validated in accordance with EMAS. In addition the German production sites have had energy management systems conforming to DIN EN ISO in place since and the Group has these systems certified every three years. The MercedesBenz Group is currently also implementing ISO systems at a number of individual sites outside Germany for example in Kecskemt in Hungary Jawor in Poland and Vitoria in Spain. In addition during the year under review the MercedesBenz Group also moved ahead with the introduction on an international scale of energy management systems certified in accordance with ISO . New management systems were implemented in Pune India and Sebes Romania for example. The effectiveness of the management systems is monitored by external auditors as part of the certification process ISO EMAS ISO as well as in the environmental sector by internal environmental risk assessments environmental due diligence process. The Group also has a standardized process in place for reviewing and assessing its consolidated production sites every five years. The results of this process are reported to the respective plant and company management so that any necessary optimizations can be carried out.Reduction of energy consumptionThe optimization of energy efficiency enables the MercedesBenz Group to decrease its energy consumption and conserve resources while reducing the CO,,0.3203232362045968,0.4129155046695329,,0.3662935270451736,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MercedesBenz Group formulates in detail what it expects from its business partners in the Business Partner Standards BPS and specifically for its suppliers in the Responsible Sourcing Standards RSS both documents are publicly available on the Group website. In the selection of direct sales partners and in existing sales partnerships the MercedesBenz Group ensures that its business partners comply with laws and observe ethical principles. For this purpose we use a globally standardized riskbased Sales Business Partner Due Diligence Process. All new sales partners are subjected to a due diligence process. A partnership is only possible if this process is successfully completed. The riskbased review takes into account among other things the planned business model the country risk and the involvement of third parties and government contacts. The concrete risks are determined using additional specific questionnaires. During the ongoing cooperation with the sales partners the existing due diligence processes are reviewed on an ad hoc or cyclical basis depending on the risks identified. Another component of the due diligence process is permanent monitoring in which the Group continuously checks existing sales partners in relevant databases and valid sanctions lists in order to identify potential breaches of integrity. If a partner fails to comply with the Group standards or if there are breaches of integrity that cannot be resolved the MercedesBenz Group reserves the right to terminate the selection process or the cooperation. In conjunction with the procurement departments the Group is constantly enhancing the existing processes for the selection of and cooperation with its suppliers.On the basis of the BPS and RSS standards and the Integrity Code the MercedesBenz Group makes webbased Compliance Awareness Modules CAMs available to both for sales business partners and suppliers.These modules are intended to sensitize them to relevant integrity and compliance requirements such as those related to anticorruption measures and technical Compliance. Through these measures the MercedesBenz Group also offers its sales business partners and suppliers extensive assistance for dealing with possible relevant compliance risks.Communication and trainingThe MercedesBenz Group offers an extensive range of compliance training courses that are based on its Integrity Code  for example courses for employees in administrative areas and for members of the Supervisory Board and the executive management of Group companies.The contents and topics of the training courses are tailored to the roles and functions of the respective target group. The MercedesBenz Group regularly analyses the need for its training programme expands or adapts it as necessary and conducts evaluations.,,,0.3524958452145549,,,0.31749458987138646,0.5069350297289071,,,,,,,0.37151328647312176,,,,,

512,Annual Report MercedesBenz GroupThe Social Compliance department helps with the definition of human rights due diligence requirements within the MercedesBenz Group and towards suppliers. Moreover it works closely with the specialist units responsible for operational implementation of the companys human rights due diligence obligations and with the procurement units in particular.Human Rights Respect System HRRSThe HRRS is the MercedesBenz Groups approach to fulfilling its human rights due diligence obligations. It encompasses the protection of our own employees through the Groupwide Social Compliance Management System Social CMS in Group companies as well as processes for human rights due diligence in supply chains as part of Supplier Compliance Risk Management SCRM for direct suppliers Tier and riskbased indirect suppliers beyond Tier . The HRRS should be understood as a due diligence cycle that basically consists of four steps . Risk assessment . Programme implementation . Monitoring and . Reporting. It is designed to systematically identify risks and potential and actual negative impacts of business activities on the respect for human rights early on avoid such effects and if necessary to initiate countermeasures. The MercedesBenz Group continues to expand the HRRS step by step and also involves external stakeholders and experts in this process. The stakeholders include rights holders such as employees and their representatives as well as local residents. For example the MercedesBenz Group also holds talks with international NGOs and other organizations concerning the human rights risks arising from the extraction of certain raw materials.Social Compliance Management SystemThrough the Social CMS the MercedesBenz Group identifies and addresses in particular those human rights risks that may arise in the workforces of its own Group companies. Employee rights are also addressed systematically and on a risk basis as part of the Social CMS. With the Social CMS the MercedesBenz Group has integrated the issue of human rights into the Groupwide systematic compliance risk management process for the Group companies. Supplier compliance risk managementAs part of Supplier Compliance Risk Management SCRM the MercedesBenz Group conducts a risk assessment of its Tier suppliers of its procurement departments for production materials nonproduction materials and services at least once a year. Following an initial overarching risk assessment the specific risks are determined using specific questionnaires. Should there be any indication revealed the responsible procurement department initiates an extensive examination of the situation.Identification of risk raw materials and servicesIn order to examine the risks associated with raw materials the MercedesBenz Group first analysed the raw materials present in a vehicle and prioritized them on the basis of various factors. It has identified critical raw materials. The list is reviewed annually on the basis of certain criteria such as the country risk of the main mining countries and updated if necessary. The Group plans to gradually examine these critical raw materials in more detail between now and and to define corresponding measures. This review consists of three steps.	Increasing transparency along the raw material supply chains  especially with regard to certain components in a MercedesBenz such as battery cells. To this end MercedesBenz AG contacts among others the suppliers of the relevant components and asks them to disclose their supplier structure..	Identification of risk hotspots in the raw material supply chains e.g. on the basis of the specific risks in the individual mining countries..	Definition and implementation of measures for the risk hotspots and review of whether they are effective over the long term. ,,0.3100904556618165,0.3543206763095286,,,,,,,,,,0.30398732639667303,,0.28548190601104895,,0.29570440197052766,,
513,Annual Report MercedesBenz GroupIn the reporting year the MercedesBenz Group was able to complete of the process of reviewing all raw materials thus achieving its target for . The achievement describes the progress in the overall process of assessing all raw materials which includes fully complete and partially complete assessments. The MercedesBenz Group also carefully checks the services it uses. Services that are particularly critical from a human rights perspective were identified as part of an impact assessment. The analysis resulted in a list of services that are potentially critical in terms of human rights. We regularly conduct such risk mapping in order to address current developments and adapt our risk classification if necessary. The main human rights risks for the identified services are then determined on a stepbystep and supply chainspecific basis and appropriate measures are defined.Requirements for suppliersThe MercedesBenz Group is committed to the responsible procurement of production materials nonproduction materials and services. The Group has incorporated the guidelines for sustainable supply chain management into the Responsible Sourcing Standards RSS. They define minimum requirements and expectations for direct suppliers and contractually oblige them to comply with these requirements to communicate them to their employees and upstream stages of the value chain and to monitor compliance with them in their business processes and sphere of influence.The goal here is to prevent minimize or if possible bring to an end any negative impacts on human rights worldwide. The RSS are an integral part of all new orders for Tier suppliers and the key contractual document for minimum and sustainability requirements. They are applied worldwide.Measures in the supply chainThe MercedesBenz Group uses a variety of measures and concepts to ensure the fulfilment of its due diligence obligations in the supply chain. This includes training preventive and corrective measures risk analyses documentation for tracking and reporting purposes and effectiveness checks. With these instruments the MercedesBenz Group intends to increase transparency in the supply chain and to ensure that internationally recognized human rights are upheld by business partners as well and that other social standards and environmental requirements are met. The procurement units for production materials nonproduction materials and services play a key role here.In addition Tier suppliers were continuously screened for human rights violations and breaches of environmental standards in the reporting year. The objective is to identify possible violations at an early stage on the basis of the latest supplier data. Should there be any indication revealed the responsible procurement department initiates an extensive examination of the situation. The MercedesBenz Group also continued to conduct audits at Tier suppliers in when it made onsite inspections. Among other things anomalies were detected with regard to working hours the communication of our sustainability standards and business ethics.If onsite inspections reveal deficiencies at a supplier the MercedesBenz Group calls on the supplier to improve the relevant processes. If the supplier does not sufficiently remedy the criticised processes the Group makes individual decisions regarding the next steps. In especially severe cases these decisions can be made by management bodies. As a last resort this can also lead to the discontinuation of the MercedesBenz Groups business relationship with a supplier.Raising awareness of human rights issues The Integrity Code and the Principles of Social Responsibility and Human Rights are binding for all employees of the MercedesBenz Group as well as the consolidated Group companies. Both are the subject of the mandatory basic online module IntegrityWork which also covers topics related to integrity and compliance and must be completed every three years by all employees of the administration of MercedesBenz Group AG as well as the consolidated Group companies. In human rights compliance training was also introduced for all managers of MercedesBenz Group AG and consolidated Group companies ,,0.3109602945545833,0.45948125630058323,,,,0.46186141638685807,,,,,,,,,,,,

516,One of the important goals of the Commission Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth in the context of the European Green Deal is to divert capital flows to sustainable investments. This is also the logic behind the EU Taxonomy Regulation EU that came into force in mid. This regulation governs the establishment of a standardized and legally binding classification system that defines the types of economic activity in the EU that are considered to be Taxonomyaligned and thus environmentally sustainable with regard to six environmental objectives established by the regulation 	 Climate change mitigation	 Climate change adaptation	 Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources	 Transition to a circular economy	 Pollution prevention and control	 Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystemsCompanies that are required to publish a NonFinancial Declaration must also comply with the Taxonomy Regulation. According to Article of the Taxonomy Regulation the Taxonomyaligned proportions of revenue capital expenditure and operating expenditure accounted for by environmentally sustainable economic activities are to be reported on an annual basis. ,0.33649951920175186,,0.4460692418158488,,0.39505409240438827,,0.425195335831696,,,,,,,,,,,,
518,Taxonomyeligibility is assessed in an initial step. For an economic activity to be Taxonomyeligible that activity must be mentioned and explained in further detail in the delegated acts for the Taxonomy Regulation. The EU delegated acts Commission Delegated Regulation EU and its supplement Commission Delegated Regulation EU which was adopted by the European Commission in June contain descriptions of relevant economic activities and technical screening criteria for the environmental objectives climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. The supplement to the delegated regulation includes new technical screening criteria that refer to both the existing economic activities and to new economic activities. Furthermore a new EU delegated act Commission Delegated Regulation EU containing economic activities and technical screening criteria relevant for the remaining environmental objectives was published in . The economic activities relevant to the MercedesBenz Group in this context are to be found under the environmental objectives climate change mitigation climate change adaptation and transition to a circular economy. On the basis of the descriptions contained in the delegated acts relating to climate change mitigation the following Taxonomyeligible economic activities have been identified for the Group	 Economic activity . encompasses manufacture of lowcarbon technologies for transport in connection with the production of cars and vans	 Economic activity . encompasses leasing and financing of lowcarbon cars and vans	 Economic activity . encompasses leasing and financing of lowcarbon commercial vehicles	 Economic activity . encompasses infrastructure enabling lowcarbon road transport and public transport charging infrastructureIn a Commission Notice C published by the European Commission on October the Commission stated that the term lowcarbon only relates to the assessment of Taxonomyalignment within the framework of the technical screening criteria and is not relevant for reporting on the Taxonomyeligible economic activity .. With regard to car manufacturer in particular and as an example the document shows that the activity manufacture of lowcarbon vehicles also includes vehicles with combustion engines. For the MercedesBenz Group this clarification by the European Commission means that the manufacture of all Group vehicles is to be classified as Taxonomyeligible.,0.31391896151258736,0.4031091284790469,0.5139057175844365,0.35231999932305363,0.35802330514406716,,0.4800317720491252,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Taxonomyeligible economic activity . that encompasses the sale of secondhand goods which are purchased by the MercedesBenz Group from third parties was identified on the basis of the descriptions in the delegated act relating to the transition to a circular economy. For the reporting year simplified reporting obligations apply for economic activities newly introduced by the delegated acts. These stipulate that only reporting in relation to Taxonomyeligibility is required. The MercedesBenz Group reports economic activity . as Taxonomyeligible but not environmentally sustainable. An assessment of Taxonomyalignment has not been carried out.The individual economic activities are additionally to be classified according to enabling activities and transitional activities. An enabling activity is an economic activity that makes a substantial contribution to one or more environmental objectives by directly enabling further activities to also make a substantial contribution. At the MercedesBenz Group this mostly applies to the economic activities . and .. A transitional activity in contrast is an economic activity for which there is no technological and economically feasible lowcarbon alternative but which makes a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation by supporting the transition to a climateneutral economy.,0.37155456842503576,0.4108896613732642,0.4763979978009557,0.38431547746438455,0.460986722703961,0.3457276760855848,0.486898110373985,0.4611974917308402,,,,,,0.3807553340421071,0.30846952219055807,,,,
522,In a further step Taxonomyalignment must be assessed for Taxonomyeligible economic activities. Only Taxonomyeligible activities can be considered as environmentally sustainable activities or as being Taxonomyaligned provided they meet certain technical screening criteria. Here the fulfilment of certain technical screening criteria with regard to the relevant economic activities must make a substantial contribution to an environmental objective defined by the Taxonomy Regulation and on the basis of defined do no significant harm criteria DNSH criteria also exclude the possibility of significant interference with another environmental objective. It must also be ensured that minimum standards are met with regard to issues such as upholding human rights or combating corruption minimum safeguards.Fulfilment of a substantial contribution to the environmental objective climate change mitigationAccording to the delegated act all vehicles below the current limit value of g CO,0.4358026094137126,0.45608725922912463,0.5098923748430819,0.36314726693193194,0.4225101455554936,0.32606296109722405,0.49172203321553143,0.42689532035984906,,0.3122815122061986,,,0.31170179339662696,0.3822283931438398,0.38234491528559905,0.29621885027965433,,0.24772503837115548,0.34758040015601804

With regard to economic activity . the fulfilment of these criteria was basically assessed at the level of those consolidated production sites where lowcarbon vehicles or associated components are currently being manufactured or plans call for them to be manufactured in the future.With regard to economic activity . the analysis of the criteria is to be performed on the basis of the lowcarbon vehicles in the leasing and financing portfolio. In addition to Groupbrand vehicles the vehicle portfolio also includes vehicles from other manufacturers. The latter are reported as Taxonomyeligible but not Taxonomyaligned as it is not currently possible to carry out an adequate DNSH analysis due to the current data availability.With regard to economic activity . the fulfilment of the DNSH criteria was reviewed at the level of the operational highpower charging stations.Climate change adaptation With regard to economic activity . the EU Taxonomy requires a climate risk analysis to be carried out. In accordance with the DNSH requirements this analysis was carried out for taxonomyrelevant production sites in connection with economic activity . in order to assess potential physical climaterelated risk factors on the basis of material climate risks in line with Appendix A Annex I of the delegated act of the EU Delegated Regulation EU . The analysis took into account climate scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC and different time horizons including . Adaptation measures were analysed on the basis of the results. In addition the verificiation of the DNSH criteria for economic activity . is essentially based on the consideration of use and environmental conditions such as heat and cold requirements in the context of vehicle development and testing.With regard to economic activity . potential climate risks according to Appendix A Annex I of the delegated act of the EU Delegated Regulation EU were assessed by relevance for the implementation of the economic activity and manufacturers specifications for the charging stations were taken into account. Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources With regard to economicactivity . fulfilment of the DNSH criteria according to the Taxonomy Regulation is intended to be ensured mainly on the basis of established environmental management systems and the internal environmental risk assessment environmental due diligence process. The company has established environmental management systems at its own production sites around the world in accordance with ISO . In addition all German and the two European manufacturing locations in Kecskemet Hungary and Vitoria Spain have also been validated in accordance with EMAS. As part of the internal environmental risk assessment consolidated production sites are evaluated according to a number of factors including those relating to water quality in a fiveyear cycle. Recommendations for minimizing risks are then drawn up prioritized and tracked. The Group also uses external data sources to identify sites that harbour potential risks relating to water scarcity. With regard to economic activity . the analysis shall assess that the use of the charging infrastructure does not give rise to any significant risk to the water quality and the water scarcity corresponding to the DNSH criteria. ,,0.3311787662827964,0.3785569345628061,0.3209857153552839,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
526,Annual Report MercedesBenz GroupTransition to a circular economy With regard to economic activity . the EU Taxonomy Regulation requires an assessment and if possible the application of measures that promote the transition to a circular economy including the use of secondary materials high durability of products and waste management in production. When developing products the MercedesBenz Group considers the concept of circular economy from the very start and has set itself the overarching goal of increasing its use of secondary materials in vehicles. In addition the DNSH criteria for economic activity . are taken into account through the implementation of the legal requirements on recyclability and reusability for passenger car models and light commercial vehicles.The MercedesBenz Group is intensifying its efforts to use lower volumes of raw materials and other materials in its production operations. In accordance with the waste hierarchy the companys primary goal is to avoid waste. For its own production sites worldwide the MercedesBenz Group has set reduction targets for factors such as total waste volume and waste volume for disposal per vehicle. Waste management is also a component of the Groups internal environmental risk assessment.For economic activity . the applicable DNSH criteria were analysed and checked for adherence. This includes the verification of the recycling or disposal of waste generated during construction and demolition.Pollution prevention and control With regard to the DNSH criteria for economic activity . under Appendix C Annex I of the delegated act of the EU Delegated Regulation EU the Taxonomy Regulation refers to the concept of avoiding the manufacturing placing on the market or use of restricted and reportable substances subject to current European legislation on chemicals. The implementation of internal processes for specification approval and control is intended to ensure compliance with European regulations according to Appendix C and respective national legislations. The Global Automotive Declarable Substance List GADSL forms the basis for the prohibition and declaration requirement of substances in MercedesBenz products. The MercedesBenz Group also defines specifications for substitution analyses and thus for the use of less critical hazardous substances. With regard to economic activity . the DNSH criteria refer to compliance with various productrelated European regulations and directives. As a result allelectric vehicles are currently considered in the Taxonomyaligned scopes of economic activity ..In due consideration of the applicable legislation and of a Notice C published by the EU Commission on October only tyres corresponding to the two highest classes for rolling resistance coefficients available on the market and at the same time the highest class for external rolling noise available on the market fulfil DNSH requirements for the respective vehicles. For the assessment of the respective classes available on the market the data of the European Product Database for Energy Labelling EPREL shall be used. The time of market placement of the vehicles in the leasing and financing portfolio was used for the analysis and a percentage share of the vehicles with the respective highest tyre classes according to EPREL was determined on the basis of a representative time period. This proportion is applied to the leasing and financing portfolio of allelectric vehicles worldwide wherever the corresponding data is available.For economic activity . the applicable requirements from the Taxonomy Regulation on noise vibration dust and pollutants must be complied with.Protection and restorationof biodiversity and ecosystems To demonstrate the requirements for economic activity . ecologically sensitive or protected areas in the neighbourhood of sites are documented and taken into account as part of the internal environmental risk assessment environmental due diligence process. Furthermore environmental impact assessments or comparable audits outside the EU are carried out in the context of a new site or the extension of an existing site if legally required. In addition the Group has established environmental management systems in accordance with ISO at its production sites.During the reporting year an environmental impact assessment was not required for the charging infrastructure economic activity . that was put into operation. Furthermore the locally applicable ,,0.3374042907021339,0.5254431593869631,,0.4409483094303176,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With regard to economic activity . the reductions due to the DNSH requirements of the environmental objective pollution prevention and control were taken into account in the Taxonomyalignment of revenues and investments.Fulfilment of minimum safeguards An economic activity can only be classified as environmentally sustainable within the meaning of the Taxonomy if it is also conducted in accordance with certain minimum standards that are based on international frameworks. Here Article of the Taxonomy Regulation references the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights including the basic principles and rights from the eight core conventions defined in the International Labour Organizations Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the International Bill of Human Rights. The Taxonomy Regulation itself does not further specify the standards.The report published by the Platform on Sustainable Finance in October Final Report on Minimum Safeguards assists companies with the interpretation of the scope and application of the minimum standards. This report forms the foundation for the application of minimum standards and the associated reporting at the MercedesBenz Group. Key issue areas here are human rights and labour rights see the chapters Social compliance and Occupational health and safety the prevention of corruption and the promotion of fair competition see the chapters Compliance management system Combating corruption and Promoting fair competition and responsible tax practices see the chapter Tax obligation. The verification of compliance here basically involves demonstrating compliance with the existence of corresponding due diligence processes at the Group level and the fact that no judicial rulings relating to serious violations in the aforementioned areas have been made in the final instance.,0.28597431702008375,0.3531780164547512,0.4177063938494544,,0.41144602874178743,0.31927778610141233,0.46293441403421776,,,0.30460014855626405,,,,,0.3025596554241386,0.24954356862557922,,,

This applies to almost all of the revenue generated by the MercedesBenz Group. In the previous year the revenues from the sale of secondhand goods which MercedesBenz Group purchased from third parties were assigned to the revenue from Taxonomy noneligible activities. Since the reporting year this revenue has been assigned to the economic activity ..Taxonomyalignment of revenueIn order to calculate the Taxonomyaligned proportion of economic activities under A. in the table Revenue revenues were examined to determine whether they were generated with lowcarbon vehicles in order to assess whether a substantial contribution had been made to climate change mitigation. Compliance with the DNSH criteria was also monitored.For the major proportion of the revenue in particular from the new and used vehicle business and leasing and sales financing activities a direct attribution was made of the revenue accounted for by lowcarbon vehicles. With regard to other revenue components especially revenue from the spare parts business and service and maintenance contracts or attribution of discounts granted for large procurement volumes it is not possible to directly assign revenue to lowcarbon vehicles. In these cases suitable allocations were therefore used for the various revenue components. These classifications are based on current or historical vehicle sales data for the fleet that is currently on the market and data on production volumes. In the reporting year the share of Taxonomyaligned revenue increased to ,,0.33395960441532924,0.36697050688233307,,,,0.44521949004218037,,,,,,,,,,,,

562,Taxonomyeligibility of capital expenditure For the share of Taxonomyeligible capital expenditure under A. in the table Capital expenditure the Taxonomyeligible capital expenditure is considered in relation to the total relevant capital expenditure of the Group.All additions to intangible assets property plant and equipment and rightofuse assets as defined in IFRS in accordance with the statements of changes in noncurrent assets as well as additions to equipment on operating leases including the additions to the named assets as part of company acquisitions are taken into account in the denominator. Equipment on operating leases only takes into account vehicles acquired by dealers from outside the Group. Goodwill acquired is not taken into account here. If a divestment is planned capital expenditure on noncurrent assets is only taken into account until the point in time at which they were first classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS . The relevant additions to the assets to be taken into account amounted to million in the reporting year million see Notes and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Additions that result from a purchase in the context of a company acquisition are of secondary importance in the reporting year.According to the Commission Notice C that the European Commission published on October the definition of an economic activity is characterized by the achievement of an output. In line with the MercedesBenz Groups business model the numerator was therefore determined by examining whether capital expenditure is made in connection with the manufacturing of vehicles the establishment of the charging infrastructure or the implementation of transport solutions for people and goods. This applies to nearly all of our investments.Taxonomyalignment of capital expenditure To calculate the Taxonomyaligned proportion of economic activities under A. in the table Capital expenditure capital expenditure was examined to determine the extent to which it was associated with lowcarbon vehicles economic activities . and . and with highpower charging stations economic activity . in order to assess whether a substantial contribution had been made to climate change mitigation. Table Capital expenditure p. shows the Taxonomyaligned capital expenditure aggregated across all economic activities. Compliance with the DNSH criteria was also monitored. The size of the share of Taxonomyaligned expenditure of total capital expenditure is mainly due to the disproportionately low share of Taxonomyaligned vehicles in the additions to the equipment on operating leases. As a result this share only partially reflects our investments in sustainable products for the future.When looking at Taxonomyaligned investments in intangible assets mainly in capitalized development costs and property plant and equipment of the MercedesBenz Group shows much higher shares of Taxonomyaligned capital expenditure table Capital expenditure. All of the capital expenditure of the MercedesBenz Group during the reporting year included in the numerator of the economic activities . and . relates to assets or processes in the context of already existing technologies which are connected to already existing Taxonomyaligned economic activities . and .. For most of the capital expenditure relating to the industrial business a direct attribution was made to allelectric vehicle projects. In the case of capital expenditure in lowcarbon plugin hybrids and assets that are used to produce both vehicles with combustion engines and lowcarbon vehicles suitable allocations based on planned vehicle sales figures for the respective model series or vehicle platforms were used. Capital expenditure that is not directly related to the manufacturing process was allocated on the basis of the planned unit ,,0.33393421858482053,0.40688706839593664,0.35310677870530754,0.3679185471679497,0.3220171162802507,0.44184661941366643,0.42862943721131974,,,,,,0.3901516103930164,,,,,0.34359855816919177
564, the percentage of Taxonomyaligned capital expenditure was at the prioryear level. There was a sharp addition to capitalized development costs the effect of which was offset by the higher total capital expenditure compared to the previous year.CapEx plan for economic activity .A capital expenditure CapEx plan that has been adopted by management must exist for capital expenditure that leads to an expansion of Taxonomyaligned economic activities or enables the conversion of Taxonomyeligible economic activities into Taxonomyaligned economic activities. At the MercedesBenz Group this affects capital expenditure for economic activity . Infrastructure enabling lowcarbon road transport and public transport charging infrastructure that is expected to fall under the environmental objective climate change mitigation. The Board of Management of MercedesBenz Group AG has adopted the planned capital expenditure for the construction of MercedesBenz own highpower charging stations as part of the corporate planning covering the period to . The CapEx plan contains total capital expenditure in the amount of around . billion whereof million are accounted for in the reporting year.,0.27579152340429175,0.3269778709638575,,0.41054420992620433,0.36301300415699456,0.39853977008785507,,0.4304755574366713,,,,,,,,,,,

657,The risk management system is intended to systematically and continually identify assess control monitor and report on risks threatening the MercedesBenz Groups existence and other material risks jeopardizing the Groups success in order to support the achievement of corporate targets and to enhance risk awareness at the Group. This also includes risks and opportunities related to environmental and employee issues as well as social factors environmental social and governance ESG.The opportunity management system at the MercedesBenz Group is based on the risk management system. The objective of opportunity management is to recognize the possible opportunities arising in business activities resulting from positive developments at an early stage and to use them in the best possible way for the Group by taking appropriate measures. By taking advantage of opportunities planned targets should be met or exceeded.The risk and opportunity management system is integrated into the valuebased management and planning system of the MercedesBenz Group and is a fixed component of the overall planning management and reporting process in the companies segments and corporate functions. The responsibility for operational risk management and for the risk management processes is borne by the first line and thus by the segments corporate functions organizational units and companies. They report on the specific risks and opportunities to the nexthigher level unit on a regular basis. Significant unexpected risks must be reported immediately. Risks and opportunities are managed within the Group by means of measures taken by the units responsible. The profitability of a measure is assessed before its implementation.The possible impact and probability of occurrence of all risks and opportunities and the related measures that have been initiated are continually monitored. This information is passed on to Group Risk Management for reporting to the Board of Management the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board. MercedesBenz Group AG monitors implementation by the segments as part of its legal regulatory and compliance functions.As part of the planning process risks and opportunities are recorded within an observation horizon of up to five years. Matters that have already been fully taken into account in planning or for which a provision has been recognized are not considered in connection with the risk management process. In addition strategic risks and opportunities are also taken into account in the risk management process. The Risk and Opportunity Report relates to . The assessment of individual risks and opportunities takes place on the basis of their probability of occurrence and possible impact on the MercedesBenz Group. Multiplying the probability of occurrence by the possible impact results in the expected value which forms the basis for the classification in risk and opportunity categories. In principle the quantification of risks and opportunities in this report is carried out by summarizing the expected values of the individual risks and opportunities in categories. The assessment of the level of risks and opportunities takes into account both planned and already effective riskreducing measures net view and is considered in relation to EBIT unless otherwise indicated.Risk and opportunity management is based on the principle of completeness. This means that all identified risks and opportunities are incorporated into the risk management process via the operating units of the segments the significant associated companies joint ventures and joint operations as well as the corporate departments. The scope of consolidation for risk and opportunity management generally corresponds to the scope of the Consolidated Financial Statements.,,0.3184675600743902,,,0.3828501172945257,,,,,,,,0.30445280086361703,,,,,,
660,The MercedesBenz Groups internal control system encompasses in addition to the accountingrelated internal control system controls for further business processes. There are also internal controls for Groupwide processes of Corporate Security Global Cyber Information Security and the Groupwide compliance management system. Sustainabilityrelated aspects are also part of the internal control system. Moreover the structure and processes of the internal control system are independently checked by Corporate Audit.The security risk management of Corporate Security is integrated into the risk management system of the MercedesBenz Group. The aim is to identify and evaluate securityrelevant risks at the companys global locations on the basis of a riskoriented view and to control them by means of mitigating measures. To this end Corporate Security implemented internal controls for various securityrelated issues. These include the areas of property security fire protection and crisis management and serve to protect the lives and physical integrity of people and to protect company assets business processes and company knowledge.The MercedesBenz Group operates an Information Security Management System ISMS with the aim of adequately protecting important information and critical IT services. The ISMS is based on internationally recognized standards and is continuously developed further. Operationally the ISMS is supported by proactive and reactive operational measures. Proactive operational measures include in particular training and measures to inform and raise awareness among employees and functionaries a comprehensive set of information security rules and technical and organizational measures to secure critical IT infrastructures IT systems and applications. One focus of the reactive operational measures is the Cyber Intelligence Response Center which is staffed around the clock to defend against cyber attacks and deal with cyber security incidents.The compliance management system which has an interface to the risk management system is aligned with the risk situation of the MercedesBenz Group and aims to promote rulecompliant behaviour within the company. The compliance management system makes a significant contribution to the integration of compliance into our operating business units and their processes. Further information on the compliance management system of the MercedesBenz Group can be found in the NonFinancial Declaration chapter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3647909381741592,,,,,,
663,Continuous monitoring of the processes and systems of the internal control and the risk management system is in effect to resolve identified weaknesses in the financial year and ensure continuous improvement of the processes and systems. As a result of the complex process landscape and the high rate of change of the legal requirements concerning nonfinancial information the maturity of the internal control system with regard to the sustainabilityrelevant aspects in particular is not yet on the level of the accountingrelated internal control system. As of the reporting date taking into account the scope of the business operations and the risk situation of the company in all material respects there are no indications of an overall inappropriateness or ineffectiveness of the internal control and risk management system.The effectiveness of any risk management and control system is subject to inherent limitations. No system even if it has been assessed as appropriate and effective can guarantee that all risks that actually occur will be detected in advance or that all process violations will be excluded under all circumstances.The internal control system with regard to the accounting process has the objective of ensuring the appropriateness and effectiveness of accounting and financial reporting. It is designed in line with the internationally recognized framework for internal control systems of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO Internal Control Integrated Framework is continually developed further and is an integral part of the accounting and financial reporting processes in the segments corporate functions organizational units and companies. The system includes principles and procedures as well as preventive and detective controls.The effectiveness of the internal control system with regard to the accounting process is systematically evaluated. It begins with a risk analysis and a control definition with the aim of identifying significant risks for the accounting and financial reporting processes in the main legal entities and corporate functions. The necessary controls are then defined and documented in accordance with Groupwide guidelines. In order to assess the effectiveness of the controls tests are carried out regularly on the basis of random samples. These form the basis for a selfassessment of whether the controls are appropriately designed and effective. The results of this selfassessment are documented and reported in a Groupwide IT system. Identified control weaknesses are eliminated taking into account their potential impact. The selected legal entities and corporate functions confirm the effectiveness of the internal control system with regard to the accounting process at the end of the annual cycle.

Regulations concerning vehicles emissions fuel consumption safety and certification as well as tariff aspects and taxes in connection with the sale or purchase of vehicles or vehicle parts play an important role. Geopolitical tensions can also have a significant impact on the business activities of an international company such as the MercedesBenz Group. The MercedesBenz Group constantly monitors the development of the legal and political framework and attempts to anticipate foreseeable requirements and longterm objectives at an early stage in the product development process. In particular changes in the legal and political framework at short notice can be associated with additional costs or higher investments.

684,Annual Report MercedesBenz GroupIndividual countries may attempt to defend and improve their competitiveness in the worlds markets by increasingly resorting to interventionist and protectionist measures. For example setting up or expanding production facilities increasing local purchasing or introducing a requirement to carry out local research and development can result in significantly increased investment or higher running costs. In addition barriers to market access such as more difficult or delayed certification processes or very complicated tariff procedures can make it more difficult to import into those countries. Investing in those countries can limit the impact of protectionist measures. Procurement market risks and opportunities Risks and opportunities relating to procurement arise for the automotive segments in particular from fluctuations in prices of commodities raw materials and energy. Certain raw materials and components are required for the manufacture of vehicles and parts and are purchased on the world market. The level of costs depends on the price development of commodities raw materials and energy and can result in both opportunities and risks for the MercedesBenz Group.For there are still risks from inflationrelated increases in raw material and energy prices which could lead to higher procurement costs. Furthermore intense competition for specific raw materials in the course of the introduction of new technologies can lead to increasing costs or possible shortages in the supply chain. Rawmaterial markets can always be impacted by uncertainties and political crises combined with possible supply bottlenecks as well as by volatile demand for specific raw materials. The ability to pass on the higher costs of commodities and other materials in the form of higher prices for manufactured vehicles is limited because of strong competitive pressure in the international automotive markets. Rising rawmaterial prices may therefore have a negative impact on the profit margins of the vehicles sold and thus lead to lower earnings in the respective segment. In order to counteract possible loss of revenue the MercedesBenz Group continuously monitors the development of rawmaterial and energy prices and is in close touch with suppliers.,,,0.3722281063439071,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
687,Annual Report MercedesBenz GroupProduction risks and opportunitiesDue to the increasing technical complexity and the goal of maintaining and constantly enhancing quality standards for the luxury vehicles of the MercedesBenz Group both risks and opportunities can arise in the automotive segments in connection with the launch and manufacture of products. The launch of new products involves risks with regard to the availability of required components the scope of equipment and the necessary production capacities especially in the course of the transformation toward electric mobility and the integration of new technology. To reduce the attendant risks the related processes are continuously evaluated and improved.Warranty and goodwill cases could arise if the quality of the products or the parts installed in the products does not meet requirements despite appropriate quality assurance processes if regulations are not fully complied with or if support cannot be provided in the required form in the event of problems and product maintenance. The MercedesBenz Group recognizes appropriate provisions for warranty and goodwill cases. Nevertheless it cannot be ruled out that recalls and field measures will lead to expenses. Possible claims in connection with such risks are examined and if necessary the appropriate measures are initiated for the affected products.Possible production interruptions that were still associated with the Covid pandemic and the related uncertainties have become less likely in the meantime. As a result the production risks are reduced from medium to low.Risks and opportunities from purchasing and logisticsInterruptions in global supply chains bottlenecks in the supply of intermediate goods and production stoppages or underutilization of suppliers production capacities can have a negative impact on business activities in the automotive divisions. Opportunities may arise for example through the implementation of efficiencyenhancing measures in internal logistics processes.Possible interruptions in global supply chains especially those caused by bottlenecks for electronic components and other important intermediate goods can cause bottlenecks at MercedesBenz Cars and MercedesBenz Vans. To avoid such bottleneck situations for intermediate goods scarce capacities are countered by planning ahead. Lack of availability and quality problems with certain vehicle parts can lead to production downtimes and cause costs that result in negative effects on profitability. As a globally operating company with an international production and sales network the MercedesBenz Group is dependent on functioning and efficient logistics processes. In particular capacity restrictions or surcharges for the transportation of vehicles can disrupt logistics processes increase their costs and have a negative impact on the companys results. MercedesBenz Cars and MercedesBenz Vans analyse these risks on an ongoing basis. Supplier management is undertaken for the prevention of risks with the aim of ensuring the quantity and quality of the components required to produce the vehicles. The financial situation of some suppliers remains difficult. The reasons for this are continuing uncertainties in connection with high commodity rawmaterial and energy prices as well as the lack of availability of components. As a result production stoppages are possible along the entire supply chain and could prevent vehicles from being completed and delivered to customers on time. Supplier risk management aims to identify potential financial bottlenecks at suppliers at an early stage and to initiate suitable countermeasures. Specifically depending on the warning signals recorded and the internal classification regular reporting dates on which key performance indicators are reported to the MercedesBenz Group and any support measures can be determined if necessary are agreed upon with suppliers. ,,,0.37462955778757145,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
688,Annual Report MercedesBenz GroupDue to the transformation to electric mobility and the outsourcing of important components there is also a risk that these will not be available on time in the planned quantity and required quality this could delay the start of production of new series. Risks may also arise from uncertainties in the planned quantities. This could have negative effects on profitability.Information technology risks and opportunitiesThe systematically pursued digitalization strategy enables the MercedesBenz Group to utilize new opportunities to increase customer utility and the value of the company. Nonetheless the high degree of penetration of all business units by information technology IT also harbours risks for our business and production processes and the units products and services. Extensive changes in the existing system landscape for example the focus on strategic partnerships for the transformation of the IT infrastructure can also lead to risks.The evergrowing threat from cybercrime and the spread of aggressive malicious code brings risks that can affect the availability integrity and confidentiality of information and ITsupported operating resources. Despite extensive precautions in the worstcase scenario this can lead to a temporary interruption of ITsupported business processes with severe negative effects on the Groups earnings. In addition the loss or the misuse of sensitive data may under certain circumstances lead to a loss of reputation. In particular stricter regulatory requirements such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation and related legislation may among other things give rise to claims by third parties and result in costly regulatory requirements and penalties with an impact on earnings.It is essential for the globally active MercedesBenz Group and its wideranging business and production processes that information is available and can be exchanged in an uptodate complete and correct form. The internal IT security framework is oriented according to international standards and also draws on industry standards and good practices for its protective measures. New regulatory requirements for cyber security and cyber security management systems are taken into account in the further development of processes and policies. Appropriately secure IT systems and a reliable IT infrastructure must be used to protect information. Cyber threats must be identified and dealt with as appropriate for their criticality over the entire life cycle of the applications and the IT systems. Special attention is paid to risks that in the event of their occurrence give rise to an interruption of business processes due to IT system failures and to the loss and the falsification of data. The advancing digitalization and networking of the means of production is accompanied by coordinated technical and organizational security measures.Due to growing requirements concerning the confidentiality integrity and availability of data the MercedesBenz Group has implemented various preventive and corrective measures so that the related risks such as possible reputational damage are minimized. For example the Group reduces potential disruptions to operational processes in computer centres by mirroring data decentralizing data storage maintaining offsite data backups and configuring IT systems for high availability. Emergency plans are drawn up and employees are trained and regularly made aware in order to remain capable of action. Specific threats are analysed and countermeasures are coordinated at a globally active Cyber Intelligence and Response Centre. The protection of products and services against the danger of hacking and cybercrime is continually further developed. The information technology risks are increasing from low to medium. The level of digitalization at the MercedesBenz Group and its suppliers is constantly increasing and is facing an ever greater external threat situation worldwide. Despite the stringent implementation of proactive and reactive measures this leads to an increased assessment of IT risk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.34001522063513384,,,,,,

823,Taxation for Groups of Companies Minimum Tax Act MinStG and is applicable to the MercedesBenz Group from January . As part of an analysis of possible effects on the Group no countries were identified as at the reporting date from which significant effects are to be expected with regard to the possible payment of a minimum tax. To introduce a mandatory temporary exemption from the requirements in IAS Income Taxes for the recording and disclosure of information about deferred tax assets and liabilities the IASB published International Tax Reform Pillar Model Rules Amendments to IAS in May . The MercedesBenz Group applies the exception rule according to IAS which stipulates that no deferred tax assets and liabilities are accounted for in connection with the income taxes of the second pillar Pillar of the OECD. In May the IASB published the standard IFRS Insurance Contracts. IFRS establishes more transparency and comparability with regard to the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts with the insurer. The application of IFRS is mandatory for reporting periods beginning on or after January . The firsttime application of IFRS had no impact on the profitability liquidity and capital resources and financial position of the MercedesBenz Group. In addition other standards and interpretations were published which are not expected to have any significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Presentation Presentation in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position differentiates between current and noncurrent assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities are generally classified as current if they are expected to be realized or settled within one year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as assets and provisions for pensions and similar obligations are presented as noncurrent items. The Consolidated Statement of Income is presented using the costofsales method. Principles of consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the financial statements of MercedesBenz Group AG and the financial statements of all subsidiaries including structured entities which are directly or indirectly controlled by MercedesBenz Group AG. Control exists if the parent company has the power of decision over a subsidiary based on voting rights or other rights if it participates in positive and negative variable returns from a subsidiary and if it can affect these returns by its power of decision.Structured entities are entities which have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not relevant in deciding who controls the entity. This is the case for example if voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements. The financial statements of consolidated subsidiaries which are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are generally prepared as of the reporting date of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The financial statements of MercedesBenz Group AG and its companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared using uniform recognition and measurement principles. IntraGroup assets and liabilities equity income and expenses as well as cash flows from transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated in the course of the consolidation process. Business combinations and changes in equity interestsBusiness combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. In connection with obtaining control noncontrolling interest in the acquiree is in principle recognized at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable assets which are measured at fair value. Changes in equity interests in subsidiaries that reduce or increase the MercedesBenz Groups percentage ownership without a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions between owners.

828,Revenue recognition Revenue from sales of vehicles spare parts and other related products is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer. This generally occurs at the time the customer takes possession of the products. If a dealer is not classified as a principal but as an agent and therefore control of vehicles is not transferred to him sales revenue is only recorded when the end customer obtains control. The brokerage commissions payable to the dealer are shown in selling expenses. Revenue recognition from the sale of vehicles for which the Group enters into a repurchase obligation is dependent on the form of the repurchase agreement.Sales of vehicles by which the MercedesBenz Group is obliged to repurchase the vehicles in the future are accounted for as operating leases. This also applies to a call option that grants the MercedesBenz Group the right to repurchase.Sales of vehicles including a put option an entitys obligation to repurchase the asset at the customers request are reported as operating leases if the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise that right at contract inception. Otherwise a sale with a right of return is reported. The MercedesBenz Group considers several factors when assessing whether the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise his or her right. Among others these are the relation between the agreed repurchase price and the expected future market value at the time of repurchase of the asset or historical return rates. Arrangements such as when the MercedesBenz Group provides customers with a guaranteed minimum resale value that they receive on resale residualvalue guarantee do not constrain the customers in their ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the asset. At contract inception of a sale with a residualvalue guarantee revenue therefore has to be recognized reduced by a potential compensation payment to the customer revenue deferral. Under a contract manufacturing agreement the MercedesBenz Group sells assets to a thirdparty manufacturer from which the MercedesBenz Group buys back the manufactured products after completion of the commissioned work. If the provision of material is not associated with the transfer of control to the service provider no revenue is recognized. For certain products sold by the Group it offers extended separately priced warranties that go beyond the statutory period as well as service and maintenance contracts. Usual for such contracts is an advance payment or the payment of constant instalments over the term of the contract. If the customer has made an advance payment the revenue from these contracts is deferred as a contract liability and recognized as revenue over the term of the contract in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred based on historical information. A future loss on these contracts is recognized in the current reporting year if the expected costs for outstanding services under the contract exceed unearned revenue. For multipleelement arrangements such as when vehicles are sold with free or reducedinprice maintenance contracts or with free online services the Group generally allocates revenue to the various elements based on their estimated relative standalone selling prices. To determine standalone selling prices the MercedesBenz Group primarily uses price lists with consideration of average price reductions granted to its customers. Depending on the sales model vehicles may be initially sold to nonGroup dealers. When control of the vehicle is transferred to the nonGroup dealer the MercedesBenz Group recognizes revenue from the sale of the vehicle. Irrespective of this an end customer can decide to enter into a leasing contract with MercedesBenz Mobility regarding such a vehicle. The vehicle is then sold by the nonGroup dealer to MercedesBenz Mobility. ,,,,,,,0.48117171687761723,0.36934489352001765,,,,0.3658463436290008,,,,,,,0.3780901481744739
829,The incremental cost of obtaining contracts is recognized as an expense when incurred if the amortization period would be no longer than one year. The MercedesBenz Group does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if at contract inception it is expected that the period between the transfer of a promised asset or service to a customer and payment by the customer will be no longer than one year. Revenue also includes revenue from the rental and leasing business as well as interest from the financial services business at MercedesBenz Mobility. Revenue generated from operating leases is recognized on a straightline basis over the periods of the contracts. In addition sales revenue is generated at the end of lease contracts from the subsequent sale of the vehicles. Revenue from receivables from financial services is recognized using the effectiveinterest method. The MercedesBenz Group uses a variety of sales promotion programmes dependent on various market conditions in individual countries as well as the respective product life cycles and productrelated factors such as amounts of discounts offered by competitors excess industry production capacity the intensity of market competition and consumer demand for the products. These programmes comprise cash offers to dealers and customers as well as lease subsidies or loans at reduced interest rates which are reported as followsRevenue is recognized net of sales reductions such as cash discounts and sales incentives granted.When loans are issued below market rates related receivables are recognized at present value using market rates and revenue is reduced for the interest incentive granted.If subsidised leasing fees are agreed upon in connection with finance leases revenue from the sale of a vehicle is reduced by the amount of the interest incentive granted. Research and noncapitalized development costs Expenditure for research and development that does not meet the conditions for capitalization according to IAS Intangible Assets is expensed as incurred. Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are expensed as incurred unless they are directly attributable to the acquisition construction or production of a qualifying asset and are therefore part of the acquisition or manufacturing costs of that asset. Depreciation of the capitalized borrowing costs is presented within cost of sales. Government grants Government grants related to assets are deducted from the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in earnings over the life of a depreciable asset as a reduced depreciation expense. Government grants which compensate the Group for expenses are recognized as other operating income in the same period as the expenses themselves. ,,,,0.33670290321136,,0.34042170105177955,0.4493608373710622,0.4063952885719155,0.36503548341085995,,,0.30930201240647043,,0.38222317956661184,,,,,
830,Gainslosses on equitymethod investments This item includes all income and expenses in connection with investments accounted for using the equity method. In addition to the prorated profits and losses from financial investments it also includes profits and losses resulting from the sale of equity interests or the remeasurement of equity interests following a loss of significant influence or joint control. The MercedesBenz Groups share of dilution gains and losses resulting from the Groups nonparticipation or subproportional participation in capital increases of companies in which shares are held and are accounted for using the equity method is also included in gainslosses on equitymethod investments. Nonparticipation or subproportional participation in capital reductions is recorded as fictitious acquisition transactions. This item also includes impairment losses andor gains on the reversal of such impairments of equitymethod investments. Other financial incomeexpenseOther financial incomeexpense includes all income and expense from financial transactions which are included neither in interest income nor in interest expense and which for MercedesBenz Mobility are included neither in revenue nor in cost of sales. Furthermore income and expenses from equity interests are included in other financial incomeexpense if such income or expenses are not presented under gainslosses on equitymethod investments. Interest income and interest expense Interest income and interest expense include interest income from investments in securities and from cash and cash equivalents as well as interest expense from liabilities. Furthermore interest and changes in fair values related to interest rate hedging activities as well as income and expense resulting from the allocation of premiums and discounts are included. The interest components of defined benefit pension commitments and similar obligations as well as of the plan assets available to cover these obligations and interest on supplementary income tax payments or reimbursements are also presented in this line item. Interest income and expense and gains or losses from derivative financial instruments related to the financial services business are disclosed under revenue and cost of sales respectively. Expense from the compounding of interest on provisions for other risks is presented in other financial incomeexpense. Income taxesIncome taxes are comprised of current income taxes and deferred taxes. Current income taxes are calculated based on the respective local taxable income and local tax rules for the period. The calculation of income taxes of MercedesBenz Group AG and its subsidiaries is based on the legislation and regulations applicable in the various countries. In addition current income taxes presented for the reporting year include adjustments for uncertain tax payments or tax refunds for periods not yet finally assessed however excluding interest expenses and interest refunds and penalties on the underpayment of taxes. In cases for which it is probable that amounts declared as expenses in the tax returns might not be recognized uncertain tax positions a liability for income taxes is recognized. The amount is based on the best estimate of the expected tax payment expected amount or most likely amount. Taxrefund claims from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is probable that they can be realized. Only in the case of taxloss carryforwards or unused tax credits no liability for taxes or tax claim is recognized for these uncertain tax positions. Instead the deferred tax assets for the unused taxloss carryforwards or tax credits are adjusted. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are generally recognized through profit and loss in deferred taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Income except ,,,,,,,0.44372668071496907,0.3734365182967355,0.32017805002049954,0.3024044283225265,0.5062651673015208,0.3420927605923431,,0.41658009664674095,,0.25722358311138516,,,0.3629641845690353
832,Other intangible assets with finite useful lives are generally amortized on a straightline basis over their useful lives three to ten years. The amortization period for intangible assets with finite useful lives is reviewed at least at the end of each reporting year. Changes in expected useful lives are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite useful lives is recorded in functional costs. With acquisitions of businesses goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair values assigned to the identifiable assets proportionally acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is accounted for at the subsidiaries in the functional currency of those subsidiaries. Emission allowances e.g. emission permits from the EU emissions trading system or the vehiclerelated emissions regulations in the USA or China to compensate for CO,0.27686465652485137,,,,0.36188227037453297,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
833, emissions are also reported under intangible assets. These certificates and rights are stated at acquisition cost. Derecognition occurs at the time the certificates or rights are returned or upon sale or expiration. Obligations to surrender emission allowances are recognized as provisions valued at the acquisition costs of emission allowances that have already been purchased. Any excess obligation that may exist is valued at the market value of the emission allowances still to be acquired. Property plant and equipment Property plant and equipment are measured at acquisition or manufacturing costs less accumulated depreciation. If necessary accumulated impairment losses are recognized. The costs of internally produced equipment and facilities include all direct costs and allocable overheads. Acquisition or manufacturing costs include the estimated costs if any of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site as well as borrowing costs. Depreciable property plant and equipment are written down by scheduled depreciation over the corresponding useful life generally on a straightline basis. The useful lives of property plant and equipment are shown in the following table. ,0.3371738643286922,0.34980042402709693,0.4545673567260593,0.38718019151997296,0.4479733315886175,0.42139739597164927,,0.37986641987892766,,,,0.38255749620627777,,,,0.24824540637411102,,,

835,Leasing Leases include all contracts that transfer the right to use a specified asset for a stated period of time in exchange for consideration even if the transfer of the right to use such asset is not explicitly described in the contract. The Group is a lessee mainly of real estate properties and a lessor of its products. The MercedesBenz Group as lessee The MercedesBenz Group as a lessee recognizes for generally all lease contracts rightofuse assets as well as leasing liabilities for the outstanding lease payments. Variable lease payments that are not included in the initial recognition of the rightofuse asset are recognized as an expense for the period. The MercedesBenz Group applies both recognition exemptions for leases with a lease term of twelve months or less shortterm leases and for leases for which the underlying asset is of low value not to recognize a rightofuse asset and a lease liability. The lease payments associated with those leases are generally recognized as an expense on a straightline basis over the lease term. ,,,,,,0.32360766664139956,,,0.3635893424317847,,,0.48829722757775756,,,,,,,0.3444583493212469
836,Rightofuse assets which are included under property plant and equipment are initially recognized at cost. The cost of a rightofuse asset comprises the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability any lease payments made at or before the commencement date any initial direct costs and an estimate of costs to be incurred in dismantling or removing the underlying asset. All leasing incentives already received from the lessor are deducted. Lease liabilities which are assigned to financing liabilities are measured initially at the present value of the lease payments still to be made. The lease liabilities include the following lease paymentsfixed payments including de facto fixed payments less lease incentives receivables from the lessorvariable lease payments linked to an index or interest rateamounts expected to be payable under residualvalue guaranteesthe exercise price of purchase options when exercise is estimated to be reasonably certain andcontractual penalties for the termination of a lease if the lease term reflects the exercise of a termination option. The MercedesBenz Group generally also applies the option for contracts comprising lease components as well as nonlease components not to split these components. Lease payments are discounted at the rate implicit in the lease if that rate can readily be determined. Otherwise discounting is at the incremental borrowing rate. This incremental borrowing rate as a riskadjusted interest rate is derived on a maturity and currency specific basis. As the cash flow pattern of the reference interest rates bullet bonds does not correspond to the cash flow pattern of a lease contract annuity a duration adjustment in order to account for that difference is used. A rightofuse asset is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and if necessary any accumulated impairment. If the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee at the end of the lease term or if the cost of the rightofuse asset reflects that the lessee will exercise a purchase option the rightofuse asset is depreciated to the end of the useful life of the underlying asset. Otherwise the rightofuse asset is depreciated to the end of the lease term. In the subsequent measurement of a lease liability the carrying amount is increased to reflect interest on the lease liability and reduced to reflect the lease payments made. According to IFRS the depreciation of rightofuse assets is recognized within functional costs. The interest due on the lease liability is a component of interest expense. Extension and termination options are part of a number of leases particularly of real estate. In determining the lease term those options are only considered if their exercise is reasonably certain. During the term these options are regularly checked with regard to their probability of being exercised. ,,,,0.3164307454477709,,0.39263934127337197,,,,,,0.42899984348030834,,,,,,,
837,The MercedesBenz Group as lessor equipment on operating leases Based on the risks and rewards associated with a leased asset it is assessed whether economic ownership of the leased asset is transferred to the lessee finance leases or remains with the lessor operating leases. For operating leasesthe economic ownership of the vehicle remains at the MercedesBenz Group. Additionally an operating lease may have to be reported with sales of vehicles for which the Group enters into a repurchase obligation.Sales of vehicles by which the MercedesBenz Group is obliged to repurchase the vehicles in the future are accounted for as operating leases. This also applies to a call option that only grants the MercedesBenz Group the right to repurchase.Sales of vehicles including a put option an entitys obligation to repurchase the asset at the customers request are reported as operating leases if the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise that right. Otherwise a sale with a right of return is reported. The MercedesBenz Group considers several factors when assessing whether a customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise his or her right at contract inception. Among others these are the relation between the repurchase price and the expected future market value at the time of repurchase of the asset or historical return rates. As part of the residualvalue management process especially for operating lease contracts certain assumptions are regularly made regarding the expected level of prices based upon which the cars to be returned in the leasing business are evaluated. If changing market developments at the balance sheet date lead to a negative deviation from previously estimated assumptions the residual value must be adjusted or an impairment carried out. Depending on the region and the current market situation the riskmitigation measures taken generally include continuous market monitoring as well as if required pricesetting strategies or salespromotion measures designed to regulate vehicle inventories. Market forecasts are verified by regular comparisons of internal and external sources and if required the determination of residual values is adjusted and further developed with regard to methods processes and systems. In the case of accounting as an operating lease these vehicles are capitalized at the amortized cost of production under equipment on operating leases and are depreciated over the contract term on a straightline basis with consideration of the expected residual values. Changes in the expected residual values lead either to prospective adjustments of the scheduled depreciation or if necessary to an impairment loss. The vehicles are allocated to the segment which bears substantially all of the residualvalue risk. Operating leases also relate to vehicles primarily Group products that MercedesBenz Mobility acquires from nonGroup dealers or other third parties and leases to end customers. These vehicles are presented at amortized cost of acquisition under equipment on operating leases in the MercedesBenz Mobility segment. If these vehicles are Group products and are subsidized and these subsidies are passed on in the lease agreement with the external customer the subsidies are deducted from the acquisition cost. After revenue is received from the sale to independent dealers these Group products generate revenue from lease payments and subsequent resale on the basis of the separate leasing contracts. In the case of finance leases the Group presents the receivables under receivables from financial services in an amount corresponding to the net investment of the lease agreements. The net investment of a lease agreement is the gross investment future lease payments and nonguaranteed residual value discounted at the rate upon which the lease agreement is based. MercedesBenz Mobility continues the leasing and salesfinancing business for Daimler Trucks commercial vehicles in some markets. To this end MercedesBenz Mobility acquires these vehicles from Daimler Truck and leases them to the end customers. Insofar as a mandatory vehicle return to Daimler Truck has been agreed a leasing contract head lease between MercedesBenz Mobility and Daimler Truck is shown. The ,,,,,,,,,,,,0.33081273482675166,,,,,,,0.3476302033608845
838,contract between MercedesBenz Mobility and the end customer constitutes a sublease in this respect. Accounting for and classification of a sublease depend on whether the contracts were concluded before or after the legal spinoff and hivedown of Daimlers commercial vehicle business. The leases that were concluded before the legal spinoff and hivedown are continued as operating leases. The head lease is presented under equipment on operating leases as a right of use which was recognized at fair value at the spinoff date and subsequently depreciated on a straightline basis. In addition a residualvalue receivable from the companies of the Daimler Truck Group is recognized. However the leasing contracts concluded after the legal spinoff and hivedown are classified and accounted for as finance leases. The net investment in the lease corresponds to the rightofuse asset from the head lease. In addition to the finance lease MercedesBenz Mobility recognizes a residualvalue receivable from the Daimler Truck Group in the amount of the guaranteed residual value. The head lease is not recorded separately. Impairment of noncurrent nonfinancial assetsThe MercedesBenz Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired or whether there is an indication that a previously recognized impairment loss may be reversed. If such indication exists the MercedesBenz Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. The recoverable amount is determined for each individual asset unless the asset generates cash inflows that are not largely independent of those from other assets or other groups of assets cashgenerating units. An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may be reversed. If this is the case the MercedesBenz Group records a partial or entire reversal of the impairment the carrying amount is thereby increased to the recoverable amount. However the increased carrying amount may not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined net of scheduled depreciation if no impairment loss had been recognized in prior years. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested at least annually for impairment. This takes place at the level of the cashgenerating units. The cashgenerating units MercedesBenz Cars and MercedesBenz Vans basically correspond to the segments. At MercedesBenz Mobility impairment testing is carried out below segment level. A distinction is made between the two cashgenerating units MercedesBenz Mobility Classic traditional financial services business and Charging Solutions development of a highpower charging network. As the Charging Solutions cashgenerating unit had neither goodwill nor other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in and there was no indication of impairment in it was not necessary to calculate the recoverable amount. If it is determined that the carrying amount of an asset or of a cashgenerating unit exceeds the recoverable amount an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For cashgenerating units the MercedesBenz Group in a first step determines the respective recoverable amount as value in use and compares it with the respective carrying amount including goodwill. If value in use is lower than the carrying amount fair value less costs of disposal is additionally calculated to determine the recoverable amount. ,,,,,,,0.433930641615117,0.3785511378397236,,,,0.3138955098238589,,,,,,,0.38899217466248
841,In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress manufacturing cost also includes production overheads based on normal capacity. Financial instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial instruments in the form of financial assets and financial liabilities are generally presented separately. Financial instruments are recognized as soon as the MercedesBenz Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. In the case of purchases or sales of financial assets through the regular market the MercedesBenz Group uses the transaction date as the date of initial recognition or derecognition. Upon initial recognition financial instruments are measured at fair value. For the purpose of subsequent measurement financial instruments are allocated to one of the categories mentioned in IFRS Financial Instruments financial assets measured at amortized cost financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. Transaction costs directly attributable to acquisition or issuance are considered when determining the carrying amount if the financial instruments are not measured at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets Financial assets primarily comprise receivables from financial services trade receivables receivables from banks cash on hand derivative financial assets marketable securities and similar investments and financial investments. The classification of financial instruments is based on the business model in which these instruments are held and on their contractual cash flows. The determination of the business model is carried out at the portfolio level and is based on managements intention and past transaction patterns. Assessments of the contractual cash flows are made on an instrumentbyinstrument basis. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets recognized at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets with cash flows other than those of principal and interest on the nominal amount outstanding. Furthermore financial assets that are held in a business model other than hold to collect or hold to collect and sell are included here. In addition derivatives including embedded derivatives separated from the host contract which are not classified as hedging instruments in hedge accounting as well as shares and marketable debt securities acquired for the purpose of selling in the short term that are classified as held for trading are included here. Gains or losses on these financial assets are recognized in profit or loss. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are nonderivative financial assets with contractual cash flows that consist solely of payments of principal and interest on the nominal amount outstanding and which are held to collect the contractual cash flows as well as to sell the financial assets e.g. to achieve a defined liquidity target business model hold to collect and sell. This category also includes equity instruments not held for trading for which the option to recognize changes in the fair value of the instrument within other comprehensive income has been applied. ,,,0.4278124559031474,0.3438970366297598,0.3474062446284199,0.34086804312002283,0.4668571696410222,0.42180052101672394,,,0.5440079232921071,0.31449217679290775,,0.3998257455772642,,,,,
842,After initial measurement financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are recognized at fair value with unrealized gains or losses being recognized in other comprehensive incomeloss. Upon the disposal of debt instruments the accumulated gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive incomeloss resulting from measurement at fair value are recognized in profit or loss. Interest earned on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income is generally reported as interest income using the effectiveinterest method. Changes in the fair value of equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are not recycled to profit or loss but reclassified to retained earnings upon disposal. Dividends are recognized in profit or loss when the right to payment has been established. Financial assets at amortized cost Financial assets at amortized cost are nonderivative financial assets with contractual cash flows that consist solely of payments of principal and interest on the nominal amount outstanding and which are held with the aim of collecting the contractual cash flows such as receivables from financial services trade receivables or cash and cash equivalents business model hold to collect. After initial recognition these financial assets at amortized cost are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effectiveinterest method less any loss allowances. Gains and losses are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income when the financial assets at amortized cost are impaired or derecognized. Interest effects from the application of the effectiveinterest method are also recognized in profit or loss as well as effects from foreign currency translation. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on hand cheques and demand deposits at banks as well as debt instruments and certificates of deposits with a remaining term when acquired of up to three months which are not subject to any material value fluctuations. Cash and cash equivalents correspond with the classification in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Impairment of financial assets At each reporting date an impairment is recognized for financial assets loan commitments and financial guarantees other than those to be measured at fair value through profit or loss reflecting expected credit losses for these instruments. Impairments are allocated using a three stage approach to expected credit losses Stage expected credit losses within the next twelve months Stage includes all contracts with no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and usually includes new acquisitions and contracts with fewer than days past due date. The portion of the lifetime expected credit losses resulting from default events possible within the next months is recognized. Stage expected credit losses over the lifetime not credit impaired If a financial asset has a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition but is not yet credit impaired it is moved to stage and measured at lifetime expected credit loss which is defined as the expected credit loss that results from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial asset.,0.2968631711009489,,,,0.39503630676173185,,,,,,0.4697200423333989,0.31074864570956856,,,,0.2409207999159033,,0.223892784971507,
844,scenario and pessimistic scenario. The impairment amount for trade receivables is predominantly determined on a collective basis. A financial instrument is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery in whole or in part for example after the end of insolvency proceedings or after a court decision of uncollectibility. Significant modification of financial assets e.g. with a change in the present value of the contractual cash flows of also leads to derecognition of the financial assets with a simultaneous recognition of new financial assets. If the terms of a contract are renegotiated or modified and this does not result in derecognition of the contract then the gross carrying amount of the contract is recalculated and a modification gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss.Offsetting of financial instrumentsFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position provided that an enforceable right currently exists to offset the amounts involved and there is an intention either to carry out the offsetting on a net basis or to settle a liability when the related asset is sold. Financial liabilities Financial liabilities primarily include trade payables liabilities to financial institutions bonds derivative financial liabilities and other liabilities. Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost After initial recognition financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effectiveinterest method. Insofar as the MercedesBenz Group enters into reverse factoring agreements in which trade receivables of a supplier are transferred to a financial intermediary changes in the presentation of the original trade payables may occur. That would be the case if these liabilities differed in nature and function from other trade payables. As a result these liabilities would be presented separately. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial liabilities recognized at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading. Derivatives including embedded derivatives separated from the host contract which are not used as hedging instruments in hedge accounting are classified as held for trading. Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in profit or loss. Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments exclusively for hedging financial risks that arise from its operating or financing activities or liquidity management. These are mainly currency risks interest rate risks and commodity price risks. ,,,,,,,0.4802674660620951,0.3796464061798221,,,,,,,,,,,
845,Contracts for the purchase or sale of nonfinancial items are regularly qualified as executory contracts and thus treated as suspended transactions although they fulfil the definition of a derivative. If such contracts do not meet the criteria for executory contracts they are recorded as derivatives. These derivatives are measured at fair value through profit or loss. The valuation effects are reported in the functional costs in which the consumption of the procured nonfinancial items e.g. energy is reported. Embedded derivatives are principally separated from the host contract and recognized separately. However embedded derivatives are not separated from the host contract if that host contract is a financial asset if the MercedesBenz Group chooses to measure a hybrid contract at fair value through profit or loss or if the embedded derivative is closely related to the host contract. Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value upon initial recognition and at each subsequent reporting date. The fair value of listed derivatives is equal to their positive or negative market value. If a market value is not available fair value is calculated using standard financial valuation models such as discounted cash flow or optionpricing models. Derivatives are recognized as assets if their fair value is positive and as liabilities if their fair value is negative. If the requirements for hedge accounting set out in IFRS are met the MercedesBenz Group designates and documents the hedge relationship from the date a derivative contract is entered into as a fairvalue hedge a cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign business operation. In a fairvalue hedge the changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment are hedged. In a cash flow hedge highly probable future cash flows from expected transactions or variable cash flows to be paid or received related to a recognized asset or liability are hedged. The documentation of the hedging relationship includes the objectives and strategy of risk management the type of hedging relationship the nature of the risk being hedged the identification of the eligible hedging instrument and the eligible hedged item as well as an assessment of the effectiveness requirements comprising the risk mitigating economic relationship the absence of deteriorating effects from credit risk and the appropriate hedge ratio. The effectiveness of the hedge is assessed at the start of and during the hedging relationship. Changes in fair value of nondesignated derivatives are recognized in profit or loss. For fairvalue hedges changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and the hedged item are recognized in profit or loss. For cash flow hedges fairvalue changes in the effective portion of derivative financial instruments are recognized after tax in other comprehensive income. Effects from hedging are presented in the item of the Statement of Income in which the underlying transaction is effective. Under IFRS for cash flow hedges in procurement transactions expected with a high degree of probability designation can be made for separable risk components of these nonfinancial hedged items. Under IFRS with cash flow hedges amounts recognized in other comprehensive income as effective hedging gains or losses from hedging instruments are removed from the reserves for derivative financial instruments and directly included in the initial cost or carrying amount of the hedged item at initial recognition if the hedged item e.g. the forecast transaction results in the recognition of a nonfinancial asset or nonfinancial liability. For other cash flow hedges the accumulated hedging gains or losses from hedging instruments are reclassified from the reserves for derivative financial instruments to the Consolidated Statement of Income when the hedged item affects profit or loss. Insofar as currency translation effects recognized in profit or loss due to trade receivables and payables are connected with the underlying hedged transactions simultaneously occurring hedging gainslosses are reclassified in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The ineffective portions of fairvalue changes are recognized directly in profit or loss. For derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship certain components can be excluded from designation and the changes in these components fair ,,,,0.33897626698851424,,0.32799097599037746,0.44485434476529745,0.37163752235079345,0.33491015115880124,,0.4731282846248004,0.3183064392616921,,0.3787315864048825,,,,,
846,value are then deferred in other comprehensive income under IFRS . This may apply for example to the time value of options the forward element of a forward contract or crosscurrency basis spreads. Hedge relationships are to be discontinued prospectively if a particular hedge relationship ceases to meet the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting under IFRS . Instances that require discontinuation of hedge accounting are among others changes to the designated hedged item loss of the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument disposal or termination of the hedging instrument or a revision of the documented riskmanagement objective of a particular hedge relationship. Accumulated hedging gains and losses from cash flow hedges are retained and are reclassified from equity as described at maturity if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur. Otherwise accumulated hedging gains and losses are immediately reclassified to profit or loss. If derivative financial instruments do not or no longer qualify for hedge accounting because the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting are not or are no longer met the derivative financial instruments are classified as held for trading and are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Pensions and similar obligationsThe measurement of defined benefit commitments for pensions and other similar postemployment benefits healthcare benefits in accordance with IAS Employee Benefits is based on the projected unitcredit method. Plan assets invested to cover defined benefit pension commitments and other postemployment benefit obligations are measured at fair value and offset against the corresponding obligations. The balance of defined benefit commitments for pensions and other postemployment benefit obligations and plan assets net pension obligation or net pension assets accrues interest at the discount rate used as a basis for the measurement of the gross pension obligation. The resulting net interest expense or income is recognized in profit and loss under interest expense or interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The other expenses resulting from pension commitments and other postemployment benefit obligations which mainly result from entitlements acquired during the year under review are taken into consideration in functional costs in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Differences between the assumptions made and actual developments as well as changes in actuarial assumptions for the measurement of defined benefit plans and similar obligations result in actuarial gains and losses which are recognized in equity through other comprehensive income. The discount factors used to calculate the present values of defined benefit pension obligations are to be determined with maturities and currencies matching the pension payments by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on highquality fixedrate corporate bonds in the respective markets. For very long maturities there are no highquality corporate bonds available as a benchmark. The respective discount factors are estimated by extrapolating current market rates along the yield curve. Gains or losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognized in profit or loss when the curtailment or settlement occurs. ,,,,,,,,,,,0.45938471840508655,,,,0.3129282287932213,0.31798452434106633,0.22558674755031505,,
847,Provisions for other risks Provisions are recognized when a obligation to third parties has been incurred an outflow of resources is probable and the amount of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. The amount recognized as a provision represents the best estimate of the obligation at the reporting date. Provisions with an original maturity of more than one year are discounted to the present value of the expenditures expected to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period. If the recognition criteria of provisions are not fulfilled and the possibility of a cash outflow upon settlement is not unlikely the item is to be presented as a contingent liability insofar as it is adequately measurable. The amount disclosed as a contingent liability represents the best estimate of the possible obligation at the reporting date. Provisions and contingent liabilities are regularly reviewed and adjusted as further information becomes available or circumstances change. A provision for expected warranty costs is recognized when a product is sold or when a new warranty programme is initiated. Estimates for accrued warranty costs are particularly based on historical experience. Other assumptions include but are not limited to the amount of potential repair costs. The provisions are regularly adjusted to reflect new information.Restructuring provisions are set up in connection with programmes that materially change the scope of business performed by a segment or business unit or the manner in which business is conducted. In most cases restructuring expenses include termination benefits and compensation payments due to the termination of agreements with suppliers and dealers. Benefits on termination of employment are recognized when the Group has a detailed formal plan that has either commenced implementation or been announced. Contract and refund liabilities Contract liabilities A contract liability is an entitys obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration or the amount is due from the customer. Refund liabilities A refund liability occurs if the MercedesBenz Group receives consideration from a customer and expects to refund some or all of that consideration to the customer. A refund liability is measured at the amount of consideration received for which the MercedesBenz Group does not expect to be entitled and is thus not included in the transaction price.Sharebased payment Sharebased payment comprises cashsettled liability awards. Liability awards are measured at fair value at each balance sheet date until settlement and are classified as provisions under consideration of vesting conditions. The profit or loss of the period equals the addition to andor the reversal of the provision during the reporting period and the dividend equivalent paid during the period and is included in functional costs. ,,,0.38151079238517976,0.3272168762817312,,0.3418795554344916,0.46957059115153543,0.38990685747148585,0.4041911523597582,0.3000366680675519,0.4713288141400726,0.31420520086134796,0.3001596036030385,0.40212217067442,0.29533281468887074,,0.23098677691979164,,0.4171825182308295

In addition interest paid as well as interest and dividends received are allocated to cash flow from operating activities. To the extent that the reverse factoring agreements entered into by the MercedesBenz Group do not result in a change in the presentation of the original trade payables the cash flows from these agreements are also presented in cash flow from operating activities. Furthermore all cash flows of receivables from financial services in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are also classified as cash flow from operating activities.

852, for the new vehicle fleet by in its business strategy. The MercedesBenz Group is aiming to shape the transformation into a softwaredriven and allelectric future. The Group is creating the necessary conditions to become allelectric. The pace of the transformation is determined by market conditions and the wishes of customers. Recognition and measurement of the Groups assets and liabilities take into account climaterelated risks and developments associated with the transformation which also include the climate targets set in the Paris Climate Agreement. Accounting estimates and management judgements in connection with sustainabilityrelated aspects are taken into consideration in particular in the accounting of assets and liabilities described below The determination and review of the useful lives of the capitalized development costs are based on the expected product life cycle. Changes in the originally envisaged product life cycles can result from the transformation to allelectric vehicles. Due to the resolutions regarding the accelerated transformation new developments in the area of conventional powertrains are reduced and already capitalized development expenditure will partly be used for longer. In the same way the useful lives of property plant and equipment assets are regularly reviewed in the light of the transformation to allelectric vehicles. This did not require any material adjustments of the useful lives up to the reporting date as the production facilities of the Group are basically flexible in use. In the context of production network management efforts are also being made to secure sites affected by the transformation by enhancing them. No significant obligations to dismantle or remove production facilities and plants that would give rise to a provision existed on the reporting date. ,,0.2990833673019066,0.36415728793745145,0.3507033377209936,,0.31136780652239476,,,,,,,,,,,,,
853,The recoverability of leased vehicles classified as operating leases is reviewed regularly. When determining recoverability the expected residual value of the leased vehicles is particularly relevant. Due to the transformation to allelectric vehicles residual values can be influenced by changing customer behavior new regulatory requirements and further technological developments. Although the currently expected residual values of allelectric vehicles were lower than originally expected no significant impairment losses were required for conventionally powered or allelectric vehicles in the reporting year. The expected proceeds from the disposal of vehicles pledged as collateral were taken into account in the determination of expected credit losses for receivables from financial services. The expected proceeds from the disposal were based on an estimate of the market value at the expected time of a possible default. There were no indications of a reduction of these estimated market values that could be traced to effects of climate change or of changing customer behaviour as of the reporting date. In addition to traditional energy supply contracts which are usually only recorded as pending transactions upon delivery the Group has concluded contracts to secure purchase quantities and prices for renewable energies in particular electricity from wind and solar energy. These are contracts that provide for a fixed remuneration per unit of energy and are mainly recognized either as derivatives or leases. The impairment test on the level of the cashgenerating units is based on the corporate planning and strategy of the MercedesBenz Group. This provides for a step by step substitution of vehicles with combustion engines by electric vehicles. For the purposes of the impairment test further risks e.g. sales risks price risks and risks regarding the future price of raw materials were also taken into account. Additional corporate planning parameters in connection with the transformation affect the investment requirements and the currently higher variable costs of allelectric vehicles in comparison with vehicles with conventional powertrains. The simultaneous development model refinement and production of electric and conventionally powered vehicles results in a high investment requirement particularly in the detail planning period until . No growth was assumed in the derivation of the terminal value due in part to the not yet completely predictable effects of the competitive situation and customer behaviour in the course of the transition to electric mobility. The impairment test carried out taking into account the transformation effects described did not result in any impairment requirement for the cashgenerating units.,,,,0.34725866640052916,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
855,In the Consolidated Financial Statements it is to a certain degree necessary to make estimates and management judgements which can affect the amounts and reporting of assets and liabilities the reporting of contingent assets and liabilities on the balance sheet date and the income and expense reported for the period. The major items affected by such estimates and management judgements are described as follows. Actual amounts may differ from the estimates. Changes in the estimates and management judgements can have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recoverable amounts of cashgenerating units and equitymethod investments In the context of impairment tests for nonfinancial assets estimates have to be made to determine the recoverable amounts of cashgenerating units. Assumptions have to be made in particular with regard to future cash inflows and outflows for the planning period and the following periods. The estimates mainly refer to future unit sales growth in the respective markets and the profitability of the products which are also highly dynamic and thus uncertain as a result of the transition to electric mobility. Therefore a risk assessment and sensitivity analyses are performed when deriving the value in use. On the basis of the impairment tests carried out in the recoverable amounts are larger than the net assets of the Groups cashgenerating units. When objective evidence of impairment or impairment reversal is present estimates and assessments also have to be made to determine the recoverable amount of an equitymethod investment. The determination of the recoverable amount is based on assumptions regarding future business developments for the determination of the expected future cash flows of that investment. On the balance sheet date the carrying amount of equitymethod investments was million December million.Recoverable amount of equipment on operating leases The MercedesBenz Group regularly reviews the factors determining the values of its leased vehicles carrying amount as of December milllion December million. In particular it is necessary to estimate the residual values of vehicles which constitute a substantial part of the expected future cash flows from equipment on operating leases. In this context assumptions are made regarding major influencing factors such as the expected number of returned vehicles the latest remarketing results and future vehicle model changes. Those assumptions are determined either by qualified estimates or by publications provided by expert third parties. Qualified estimates are based as far as publicly available on external data with consideration of internally available additional information such as historical experience of price developments and sale prices. The residual values thus determined serve as a basis for depreciation changes in residual values lead either to prospective adjustments of the depreciation or in the case of a significant decline in expected residual values to an impairment. If depreciation is prospectively adjusted changes in estimates of residual values do not have a direct effect but are equally distributed over the remaining term of the lease contract.,,,,0.3221527963211352,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
856,Collectability of receivables from financial servicesThe Group regularly estimates the risk of default on receivables from financial services carrying amount as of December million December million. Many factors are taken into consideration in this context including historical loss experience the size and composition of certain portfolios current economic events and conditions and the current fair values and adequacy of collaterals. In addition to historical and current information on losses appropriate and reliable forwardlooking information on factors is also included. This information includes macroeconomic factors e.g. gross domestic product growth unemployment rate cost performance index and forecasts of future economic conditions. For receivables from financial services these forecasts are performed using a scenario analysis basic scenario optimistic scenario and pessimistic scenario. Further external information which cannot be depicted in the scenarios is as far as necessary included in the assessment through subsequent adjustments. Changes to the estimation and assessment of these factors influence the allowance for credit losses with a resulting impact on the Groups net profit. Product warranties The Group provides various types of product warranties depending on the type of product and market conditions. Provisions for product warranties carrying amount as of December million December million are generally recognized at the time of vehicle sale. In order to determine the extent of these provisions assumptions have to be made concerning the type and extent of future warranty claims and goodwill cases as well as on possible recall campaigns for each model series. These assessments are based on experience of the frequency and extent of vehicle faults and defects in the past. In addition the estimates also include assumptions on the amounts of potential repair costs per vehicle and the effects of possible time or mileage limits. The provisions are regularly adjusted to reflect new information. Liability and litigation risks and governmental proceedings Various legal proceedings claims and governmental investigations are pending against MercedesBenz Group AG and its subsidiaries on a wide range of topics. If the outcome of such legal proceedings is detrimental to the MercedesBenz Group the Group may be required to pay substantial compensatory and punitive damages to undertake service actions or recall campaigns to pay fines or to carry out other costly actions. Litigation and governmental investigations often involve complex legal issues and are connected with a high degree of uncertainty. Accordingly the assessment of whether an obligation exists on the balance sheet date as a result of an event in the past and whether a future cash outflow is likely and the obligation can be reliably estimated largely depends on estimations by the management. The MercedesBenz Group regularly evaluates the current stage of legal proceedings also with the involvement of external legal counsel. It is therefore possible that the amounts of provisions for pending or threatened proceedings will have to be regularly restated due to new expected developments. As of December the carrying amounts of provisions for liability and litigation risks are million December million. Changes in estimates and assumptions can have a material effect on the Groups future profitability liquidity and capial resources and financial position. It is also possible that provisions recognized for some legal proceedings may turn out to be insufficient once such ,,,,,,,0.46847712288912896,0.36606484631726505,,,,,,,,,,,0.4019252360766497

The special funds are set up in particular in order to diversify the capitalinvestment strategy. At the reporting date the Group has business relationships with controlled structured entities of which all are fully consolidated. In addition as in the previous year the Group has relationships with one noncontrolled structured entity. ,,,,,,,,,,,0.47314306973988984,0.36696763033481317,,,,,,,

Income of million was realized for the operating investments and business activities disposed of in in particular in the MercedesBenz Cars segment. In total expenses from the realization of the currency reserve of million were recognized. In there were no significant effects on the profitability liquidity and capital resources and financial position. Sale of foreign retail activities and other sales companies Agreements on the sale of further sales activities in other European countries were concluded in . The disposals are to take place successively over the course of . The criteria for classification as assets and liabilities held for distribution or sale are met as of December . The assets of . billion and liabilities of . billion are therefore reported as assets and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position of December in accordance with IFRS . Of the assets . billion is attributable to the MercedesBenz Cars segment and . billion to the MercedesBenz Vans segment. Assets mainly comprise inventories of . billion property plant and equipment of . billion and trade receivables of . billion. The liabilities which are almost entirely attributable to the MercedesBenz Cars segment mainly include financing liabilities to financial institutions of . billion. In January the Group divested its retail activities in Italy. There were no significant effects on the profitability liquidity and capital resources and financial position. The sales company in Greece and other dealers in Europe were already sold in the course of . The disposals resulted in income of million. The cash inflow amounted to a total of million. The effects are mainly allocated to the MercedesBenz Cars segment. In addition further retail activities in various countries in particular those allocated to the MercedesBenz Cars segment were sold in . The disposals resulted in income of million and cash inflows of million. In December the contractual arrangements on the sale of the retail activities in Canada were concluded. The transaction became effective in February and the Group recognized other operating income of million which was mainly allocated to the MercedesBenz Cars segment. The cash inflow amounted to million and was also mainly allocated to the MercedesBenz Cars segment. Parts of the purchase price were financed by MercedesBenz Financial Services in Canada and led to a cash outflow of million at the MercedesBenz Mobility segment. Sale of Indonesian sales and production entitiesThe MercedesBenz Group sold its subsidiaries in Indonesia to a local investor with effect from September . The sale of both companies resulted in an income of million and a cash inflow of million which are allocated to the MercedesBenz Cars segment. Assets decreased by million and liabilities by million as a result of deconsolidation. ,,,,,,,0.4425691786414076,,,,,,,,,,,,
871,Revenue in was slightly above the previous years level. The increase in revenue was primarily due to higher unit sales and improved pricing at the MercedesBenz Vans segment. Revenue in the MercedesBenz Cars segment was also higher primarily due to a further improvement in pricing. However negative exchangerate effects had an opposing effect causing a reduction in revenue. Revenue disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Income includes revenue from contracts with customers which are in the scope of IFRS revenue according to IFRS and other revenue not in the scope of IFRS . The composition of the revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income is shown by region in Note . Revenue according to IFRS is disaggregated by the two categories type of products and services and geographical regions. The category type of products and services corresponds to the reported segments. Revenue according to IFRS includes revenue that was included in contract liabilities at December in an amount of million million and revenue from performance obligations fully or partially satisfied in previous periods in an amount of million million. Revenue related to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied by the end of the reporting period that is expected to be recognized within three years amounted to million at December million. This revenue is mainly derived from longterm service and maintenance contracts and extended warranties. It does not include performance obligations from customer contracts that have initial expected durations of one year or less. The number of vehicles for which the expected original delivery time will exceed twelve months was immaterial and is therefore not part of the disclosed amount. Longterm performance obligations of minor importance to the overall contract value of a bundled contract are not considered in assessing the initial duration of the bundled contract. ,,0.30329885950920793,,0.32022033965459296,,0.3348329805004632,0.5433958470218223,0.43805845643911395,0.354780337387199,0.3095326464472577,,,,0.3849791560611823,,,,,0.3458725456399876

1020,Most employees in Germany have defined benefit pension commitments most of the pension commitments for the active workforce are based on individual retirement benefit accounts to which the Company makes annual contributions. The amount of the contributions for nonexempt employees depends on the tariff classification in the respective year or on their respective income for executives it depends on their respective income. For the commitments to retirement benefits made prior to the contributions continue to be converted into capital components and credited to the individual pension accounts with the application of fixed factors related to each employees age. The conversion factors include a fixed value increase. For the commitments to retirement benefits made as of the Company guarantees at a minimum the value of the contributions paid into a cashbalance plan. Pension payments are made either as a life annuity twelve annual instalments or a single lump sum.

1102,MercedesBenz Group AG and its subsidiaries recognize provisions in connection with pending or threatened proceedings to the extent an obligation is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Such provisions are recognized in the Groups Consolidated Financial Statements and are based on estimates. If quantifiable contingent liabilities in connection with legal proceedings are disclosed in the Groups Consolidated Financial Statements. Risks resulting from legal proceedings sometimes cannot be assessed reliably or only to a limited extent. Consequently provisions recognized for some legal proceedings may turn out to be insufficient once such proceedings have ended. The MercedesBenz Group may also become liable for payments in legal proceedings for which no provisions were recognized andor contingent liabilities were disclosed. Uncertainty exists with regard to the amounts or due dates of possible cash outflows. Although the final result of any such proceedings could materially affect the Groups operating results and cash flows for a particular reporting period the MercedesBenz Group believes that it should not exert a sustained influence on the Groups financial position. ,,,,,,,,,0.3105687583882745,,,,,,,,,,

1108,The table Carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments shows the carrying amounts and fair values of the respective classes of the Groups financial instruments and contain the Group amounts including assets and liabilities held for sale. The fair values of financial instruments were calculated on the basis of market information available on the balance sheet date. The following methods and assumptions were used. Receivables from financial services The fair values of receivables from financial services with variable interest rates are estimated to be equal to the respective carrying amounts because the agreed upon interest rates and those available in the market do not significantly differ. The fair values of receivables from financial services with fixed interest rates are determined on the basis of discounted expected future cash flows. Discounting is based on the current interest rates at which similar loans with identical terms could have been obtained at December and December . Trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents Due to the short terms and the fundamentally lower credit risk of these financial instruments it is assumed that their fair values are equal to the carrying amounts.Marketable debt securities and similar investments other financial assets Marketable debt securities are recognized at fair value through other comprehensive income or at fair value through profit or loss. Similar investments are measured at amortized cost and are not included in the measurement hierarchy as their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair value due to the short terms of these financial instruments and the fundamentally low credit risk. Equity instruments are recognized at fair value through other comprehensive income or at fair value through profit or loss. Equity instruments recognized at fair value through other comprehensive income are included in the table Carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments and primarily comprise the shares in Sila Nanotechnologies Inc. Momenta Global Limited and Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings Plc. The remaining investments recognized at fair value through other comprehensive income comprise further investments not material on an individual basis. Marketable debt securities and equity instruments recognized at fair value were measured using quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period. If quoted market prices are not available for these debt and equity instruments fair value measurement is based on inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable in active markets. Fair values are calculated using recognized financial valuation models such as discounted cash flow models or multiples. Other financial assets recognized at fair value through profit or loss relate to derivative financial instruments not used in hedge accounting. These financial instruments as well as derivative financial instruments used in hedge accounting comprise derivative currency hedging contracts the fair values of crosscurrency interest rate swaps are determined on the basis of the discounted estimated future cash flows taking account of credit premiums and default risks using the market interest rates appropriate to the remaining terms of the financial instruments. The measurement of currency forwards is based on market quotes of forward curves. Currency options are measured with optionpricing models using market data.derivative interest rate hedging contracts the fair values of interest rate hedging instruments e.g. interest rate swaps are calculated on the basis of the discounted estimated future cash flows taking account of credit premiums and default risks using the ,0.28085998855001393,,,,,,0.42296520652543157,0.3739895592382348,0.3208546926324272,,0.49903166934378695,,,,,,,0.22344975371189724,
1109,market interest rates appropriate to the remaining terms of the financial instruments. derivative commodity hedging contracts the fair values of commodity hedging contracts e.g. commodity forwards are determined on the basis of current reference prices with consideration of forward premiums and discounts and default risks. Other financial receivables and other financial assets are carried at amortized cost. Because of the predominantly short maturities and the fundamentally lower credit risk of these financial instruments it is assumed that the fair values approximate the carrying amounts. Financing liabilities Financing liabilities are measured at amortized cost. The fair values of bonds loans commercial paper deposits in the direct banking business and liabilities from ABS transactions are calculated as present values of the estimated future cash flows taking account of credit premiums and credit risks. Market interest rates for the appropriate terms are used for discounting. Trade payables Due to the short maturities of these financial instruments it is assumed that their fair values are equal to the carrying amounts. Reverse factoring agreements did not change the relevant characteristics of a trade payable for the Group for the liabilities concerned. As a result there were no reclassifications of these trade payables to financing liabilities. Contract and refund liabilities Contract and refund liabilities include obligations from sales transactions that qualify as financial instruments. Obligations from sales transactions should generally be regarded as current. Due to the short maturities of these financial instruments it is assumed that their fair values are equal to the carrying amounts. Other financial liabilities Financial liabilities recognized at fair value through profit or loss comprise derivative financial instruments not used in hedge accounting. For information regarding these financial instruments as well as derivative financial instruments used in hedge accounting see the notes above under Marketable debt securities and similar investments other financial assets. Miscellaneous other financial liabilities are carried at amortized cost.

1145,Use of derivatives The MercedesBenz Group uses derivative financial instruments exclusively for hedging financial risks that arise from its operating or refinancing activities or from its liquidity management. These are mainly currency risks interest rate risks and commodity price risks which have been defined as risk categories. For these hedging purposes the Group mainly uses currency forward transactions crosscurrency interest rate swaps interest rate swaps options and commodity forwards. The following table shows the amounts for the transactions designated as hedging instruments. Most of the transactions for which the effects from the measurement of the hedging instrument and the underlying transaction to a large extent offset each other in the Consolidated Statement of Income were mostly not included in the hedge accounting.Even if derivative financial instruments do not or no longer qualify for hedge accounting these instruments still serve to hedge financial risks from business operations. A hedging instrument is terminated when the hedged transaction no longer exists or is no longer expected to occur.

1166,As a result of its businesses and the global nature of its operations the MercedesBenz Group is exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchangerates and interest rates while price risks arise from the procurement of raw materials and energy for example. An equity price risk results from investments in listed companies. In addition the Group is exposed to credit risks from its leasing and mainly financing activities and from its business operations trade receivables. Furthermore the Group is exposed to country and liquidity risks relating to its credit and market risks or a deterioration of its business operations or financial market disturbances. If these financial risks materialize they could adversely affect the Groups profitability liquidity and capital resources and financial position. The MercedesBenz Group has established internal policies for risk controlling procedures and for the use of financial instruments including a clear segregation of duties with regard to financial activities settlement accounting and the related controlling. The guidelines upon which the Groups risk management processes for financial risks are based are designed to identify and analyse these risks throughout the Group to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor the risks by means of reliable and uptodate administrative and information systems. The guidelines and systems are regularly reviewed and adjusted to changes in markets and products. The Group manages and monitors these risks primarily through its operating and financing activities and if required through the use of derivative financial instruments. The MercedesBenz Group uses derivative financial instruments exclusively for hedging financial risks that arise from its business operations or refinancing activities or liquidity management. Without these derivative financial instruments the Group would be exposed to higher financial risks. Additional information on financial instruments and especially on the volumes of the derivative financial instruments used is included in Note . The MercedesBenz Group regularly evaluates its financial risks with due consideration of changes in key economic indicators and uptodate market information. ,,,,,,,,,,,0.4587878242076699,,,,,,,,

1174,Receivables from financial services The MercedesBenz Groups financing and leasing activities are primarily focused on supporting the sales of the Groups automotive products. As a consequence of these activities the Group is exposed to credit risk which is monitored and managed based on defined standards guidelines and procedures. The MercedesBenz Group manages its credit risk irrespective of whether it is related to a financing contract or to an operating lease or a finance lease contract. For this reason statements concerning the credit risk of MercedesBenz Mobility refer to the entire financing and leasing business unless otherwise specified. Exposure to credit risk from financing and lease activities is monitored based on the portfolio subject to credit risk. The portfolio subject to credit risk consists of wholesale and retail receivables from financial services and the portion of the operating lease portfolio that is subject to credit risk. Receivables from financial services comprise claims arising from finance lease contracts and repayment claims from financing loans. The operating lease portfolio is reported under equipment on operating leases in the Groups Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Lease payments due from operating lease contracts are recognized in receivables from financial services. The MercedesBenz Mobility segment has policies setting the framework for effective risk management at a global as well as a local level. In particular these policies deal with minimum requirements for all riskrelevant credit processes the definition of financing products offered the evaluation of customer quality requests for collateral and the treatment of unsecured loans and nonperforming claims. The limitation of concentration risks is implemented primarily by means of global limits which refer to customer exposures. To comply with these limits MercedesBenz Mobility applies approval standards and measures to avoid concentration risks. Only one customer was granted a credit line in the form of a large loan. The MercedesBenz Mobility portfolio consists of a large number of small and mediumsized enterprises and private customers from more than countries. At December this segment accounted for of the portfolio. With respect to its financing and lease activities the Group holds collateral for customer transactions limiting actual credit risk through its fair value. The value of collateral generally depends on the amount of the financed assets. The financed vehicles usually serve as collateral. Furthermore MercedesBenz Mobility limits credit risk from financing and lease activities for example through deposits from customers. For the assessment of the default risk of retail and small business customers scoring systems are applied to evaluate their creditworthiness. Corporate customers are evaluated using internal rating instruments. Both evaluation processes use external credit bureau data if available. The scoring and rating results as well as the availability of security and other risk mitigation instruments such as deposits guarantees and to a lesser extent residual debt insurances are essential elements for credit decisions. ,,,,,,,0.42338740956398174,0.38072774847780116,,,,,,,,,,,
1175,If in connection with contracts a worsening of payment behaviour or other causes of a credit risk are recognized collection procedures are initiated by claims management to obtain the overdue payments of the customer to take possession of the asset financed or leased or alternatively to renegotiate the impaired contract. Internal restructuring policies and practices for loan and leasing contracts are based on the indicators or criteria which in the judgement of local management indicate that repayment will probably continue and that the total proceeds expected to be derived from the renegotiated contract exceed the expected proceeds to be derived from immediate repossession and remarketing. In the case of receivables from financial services significant modifications of financial assets were only made in rare cases and to an insignificant extent. The allowance ratio decreased compared to the previous year due to the sale of the Russian MercedesBenz Mobility companies for which very high provisions were recorded in . The default rate has increased compared to the very low figures in the previous year mainly due to a challenging lending environment in the United States. For information on credit risks included in receivables from financial services see Note . Information on the measurement of expected credit losses is provided in Note . Trade receivables Trade receivables are mostly receivables from worldwide sales of vehicles and spare parts. The credit risk from trade receivables encompasses the default risk of customers e.g. dealers and general distribution companies as well as other corporate and private customers. In order to identify credit risks the MercedesBenz Group assesses the creditworthiness of customers. The MercedesBenz Group manages its credit risk from trade receivables using appropriate IT applications and databases on the basis of internal policies which have to be followed Groupwide. A significant proportion of the trade receivables from each countrys domestic business is secured by various countryspecific types of collateral. This collateral includes conditional sales guarantees and sureties as well as mortgages and deposits from customers. For trade receivables from the export business the MercedesBenz Group also evaluates its customers creditworthiness by means of an internal rating process with consideration of the respective country risk. In this context the Annual Financial Statements and other relevant information on the general distribution companies such as payment history are used and assessed. Depending on the creditworthiness of the customers the MercedesBenz Group establishes credit limits and limits credit risks with the following types of collateral credit insurancesfirstclass bank guarantees andletters of credit. These procedures are defined in the export credit guidelines which have Groupwide validity. For impairments of trade receivables the simplified approach is applied according to which these receivables are allocated to stage . Credit losses until maturity for these trade receivables are recognized upon initial recognition. Further information on trade receivables and the status of loss allowances recognized is provided in Note . ,,,,,,,0.4574490888842191,0.383100519713421,,,,,,,,,,,0.35394448342579027
1176,Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments exclusively for hedging financial risks that arise from its operational business financing activities or liquidity management. The MercedesBenz Group manages its credit risk exposure in connection with derivative financial instruments through a limit system which is based on the review of each counterpartys financial strength. This system limits and diversifies the credit risk. As a result the MercedesBenz Group is exposed to credit risk only to a small extent with respect to its derivative financial instruments. In accordance with the Groups risk policy most derivatives are contracted with counterparties which have an external rating of A or better. Other receivables and financial assets The MercedesBenz Group is exposed to credit risk only to a small extent with respect to other receivables and financial assets included in other financial assets in and . Irrevocable loan commitments The MercedesBenz Mobility segment in particular is exposed to credit risk from irrevocable loan commitments to end customers and retailers. At December irrevocable loan commitments amounted to million million. These loan commitments had a maturity of less than one year and are not subject to a material credit risk based on the current state of knowledge. Financial guarantees The maximum potential obligations resulting from financial guarantees amounted to million at December million and included liabilities recognized at December in the amount of million million. Financial guarantees represent contractual arrangements. These guarantees generally provide that in the event of default or nonpayment by the primary debtor the Group will be required to settle such financial obligations generally up to a contractually agreed amount. ,,,,0.31455903650692113,,,,,,,0.47720856515775556,,,,,,,,

1190,The global nature of its businesses exposes the MercedesBenz Group to significant market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchangerates and interest rates as well as commodity and energy prices. The Group is also exposed to equity price risk in connection with its investments in listed companies. The MercedesBenz Group manages market risks to minimize the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchangerates and interest rates on the earnings of the Group and its segments. The Group calculates its overall netexposure to these market risks to provide the basis for hedging decisions which include the selection of hedging instruments and the determination of hedging volumes and the corresponding periods. The hedging strategy is specified at Group level and uniformly implemented in the segments. Decisions regarding for example currencies and assetliability management interest rates are made by a committee that meets regularly. Netexposures are the basis for the hedging strategies and are updated regularly. The MercedesBenz Group usually counteracts the risk of shortterm fluctuations in rawmaterial prices by means of price escalation clauses in the supply contracts. Power purchase agreements are also concluded to reduce electricity price risks. Power purchase agreements are purchase agreements for energy needs including fixed purchase prices of the electricity generated by a specific plant for generating wind or solar power. Certain existing benchmark interest rates including those of the London Interbank Offered Rate for USD GBP CHF and JPY were comprehensively and internationally reformed. As a result those interest rates were gradually abolished and replaced with alternative riskfree reference rates. Alternative interest rates were developed on a national level in the context of the respective legal systems and currencies they can therefore vary with regard to their structure methodology and period of publication. As the reform for EURIBOR and USD GBP CHF and JPY LIBOR has already been implemented the contractual adjustment of financial instruments has already been made in line with a corresponding interest rate reference. The conversion of the outstanding reference rates of hedging instruments and their underlying transactions was identical and without any material delay. The MercedesBenz Group considered the economic relationship and thus the continuation of hedge accounting to be still existing as of December . The nominal values of those hedging instruments that were affected in the prior year and are included in a hedging relationship can be found in table Nominal amounts of derivative financial instruments used in hedge accounting in Note . The effect of the application of the new interest rates on the Consolidated Financial Statements is being reviewed on an ongoing basis. In order to conduct financial transactions based on the new indices the MercedesBenz Group is preparing its relevant ITsystems accordingly. Uncertainty still exists about future market standards with interest conventions for individual financial products cash products and interest derivatives that reference the new riskfree rates. Contracts not yet converted as part of the IBOR reform in the previous year USD LIBOR amounted to million in financial liabilities and million in derivatives as of December . As part of its risk management system the MercedesBenz Group employs valueatrisk analyses. In performing these analyses the MercedesBenz Group quantifies its market risk due to changes in foreign currency exchangerates and interest rates and certain commodity prices on a regular basis by predicting the potential loss over a target time horizon holding period and confidence level. ,,,,0.3668405973070389,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1210,The internal management and reporting structure at the MercedesBenz Group is principally based on the accounting policies according to IFRS that are described in Note . The measure of the Groups net profit or loss used by the MercedesBenz Groups management and reporting structure is referred to as EBIT. EBIT comprises gross profit selling and general administrative expenses research and noncapitalized development costs other operating incomeexpense and the gainslosses on equitymethod investments as well as other financial incomeexpense. In justified individual cases effects on the Groups Consolidated Statement of Income Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are not allocated to the corresponding segment based on a legal point of view but the segment report rather follows an economic approach. Intersegment revenue is principally recorded at prices that approximate market terms. Transactions between the segments are generally eliminated in the reconciliation. The elimination of effects connected with intraGroup transfers of equity investments principally takes place in the segments involved. The effects on earnings at the Group are normally recognized in the corresponding segment upon completion of the external transaction. Some simplifications have been made in the segment reporting with regard to accounting for leasing agreements in connection with intraGroup transactions. Segment assets principally comprise all assets. The assets of the MercedesBenz Cars and MercedesBenz Vans segments exclude income tax assets assets from defined benefit pension plans and other postemployment benefit plans and certain financial instruments including liquidity. ,,0.30788283310786757,,,,,0.46631846951513695,0.3704437102910113,,,,,,,,,,,
1211,Segment liabilities principally comprise all liabilities. The MercedesBenz Cars and MercedesBenz Vans reporting segments liabilities exclude income tax liabilities liabilities from pensions and similar obligations and certain financial instruments including financing liabilities. The residualvalue risks associated with the Groups operating leases and receivables from financial services are generally borne by the segments which manufactured the leased vehicles. Risk sharing is based on agreements between MercedesBenz Cars MercedesBenz Vans and MercedesBenz Mobility the terms vary by segment and geographic region. Noncurrent assets consist of intangible assets property plant and equipment and equipment on operating leases. Capital expenditures for intangible assets and property plant and equipment reflect the casheffective additions to these intangible assets and property plant and equipment insofar as they do not relate to capitalized borrowing costs or goodwill.
