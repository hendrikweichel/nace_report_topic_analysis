Revenue in was slightly above the previous years level. The increase in revenue was primarily due to higher unit sales and improved pricing at the MercedesBenz Vans segment. Revenue in the MercedesBenz Cars segment was also higher primarily due to a further improvement in pricing. However negative exchangerate effects had an opposing effect causing a reduction in revenue. Revenue disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Income includes revenue from contracts with customers which are in the scope of IFRS revenue according to IFRS and other revenue not in the scope of IFRS . The composition of the revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income is shown by region in Note . Revenue according to IFRS is disaggregated by the two categories type of products and services and geographical regions. The category type of products and services corresponds to the reported segments. Revenue according to IFRS includes revenue that was included in contract liabilities at December in an amount of million million and revenue from performance obligations fully or partially satisfied in previous periods in an amount of million million. Revenue related to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied by the end of the reporting period that is expected to be recognized within three years amounted to million at December million. This revenue is mainly derived from longterm service and maintenance contracts and extended warranties. It does not include performance obligations from customer contracts that have initial expected durations of one year or less. The number of vehicles for which the expected original delivery time will exceed twelve months was immaterial and is therefore not part of the disclosed amount. Longterm performance obligations of minor importance to the overall contract value of a bundled contract are not considered in assessing the initial duration of the bundled contract.

Annual Report MercedesBenz GroupWith regard to the confirmed violations the MercedesBenz Group decides on appropriate response measures in line with the principles of proportionality and fairness. The personnel measures in included admonishments warnings and terminations without notice.Sales partners and suppliersThe MercedesBenz Group expects not only its employees to comply with laws and regulations. The Group also places clear compliance requirements on its sales partners and suppliers because it regards integrity and conformity with regulations as a precondition for trustbased cooperation. The MercedesBenz Group formulates in detail what it expects from its business partners in the Business Partner Standards BPS and specifically for its suppliers in the Responsible Sourcing Standards RSS both documents are publicly available on the Group website. In the selection of direct sales partners and in existing sales partnerships the MercedesBenz Group ensures that its business partners comply with laws and observe ethical principles. For this purpose we use a globally standardized riskbased Sales Business Partner Due Diligence Process. All new sales partners are subjected to a due diligence process. A partnership is only possible if this process is successfully completed. The riskbased review takes into account among other things the planned business model the country risk and the involvement of third parties and government contacts. The concrete risks are determined using additional specific questionnaires. During the ongoing cooperation with the sales partners the existing due diligence processes are reviewed on an ad hoc or cyclical basis depending on the risks identified. Another component of the due diligence process is permanent monitoring in which the Group continuously checks existing sales partners in relevant databases and valid sanctions lists in order to identify potential breaches of integrity. If a partner fails to comply with the Group standards or if there are breaches of integrity that cannot be resolved the MercedesBenz Group reserves the right to terminate the selection process or the cooperation. In conjunction with the procurement departments the Group is constantly enhancing the existing processes for the selection of and cooperation with its suppliers.On the basis of the BPS and RSS standards and the Integrity Code the MercedesBenz Group makes webbased Compliance Awareness Modules CAMs available to both for sales business partners and suppliers.These modules are intended to sensitize them to relevant integrity and compliance requirements such as those related to anticorruption measures and technical Compliance. Through these measures the MercedesBenz Group also offers its sales business partners and suppliers extensive assistance for dealing with possible relevant compliance risks.Communication and trainingThe MercedesBenz Group offers an extensive range of compliance training courses that are based on its Integrity CodeÂ  for example courses for employees in administrative areas and for members of the Supervisory Board and the executive management of Group companies.The contents and topics of the training courses are tailored to the roles and functions of the respective target group. The MercedesBenz Group regularly analyses the need for its training programme expands or adapts it as necessary and conducts evaluations.

Types of receivables Receivables from sales financing with customers include receivables from credit financing for nonGroup third parties who purchased their vehicle either from a dealer or directly from the MercedesBenz Group. Receivables from sales financing with dealers represent loans for floor financing programmes for vehicles purchased from the MercedesBenz Group. In addition these receivables also relate to the financing of other assets that the dealers purchased from third parties in particular used vehicles or property. Receivables from finance lease contracts consist of receivables from leasing contracts for which all substantial risks and rewards incidental to the leasing objects are transferred to the lessee.

Revenue recognition Revenue from sales of vehicles spare parts and other related products is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer. This generally occurs at the time the customer takes possession of the products. If a dealer is not classified as a principal but as an agent and therefore control of vehicles is not transferred to him sales revenue is only recorded when the end customer obtains control. The brokerage commissions payable to the dealer are shown in selling expenses. Revenue recognition from the sale of vehicles for which the Group enters into a repurchase obligation is dependent on the form of the repurchase agreement.Sales of vehicles by which the MercedesBenz Group is obliged to repurchase the vehicles in the future are accounted for as operating leases. This also applies to a call option that grants the MercedesBenz Group the right to repurchase.Sales of vehicles including a put option an entitys obligation to repurchase the asset at the customers request are reported as operating leases if the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise that right at contract inception. Otherwise a sale with a right of return is reported. The MercedesBenz Group considers several factors when assessing whether the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise his or her right. Among others these are the relation between the agreed repurchase price and the expected future market value at the time of repurchase of the asset or historical return rates. Arrangements such as when the MercedesBenz Group provides customers with a guaranteed minimum resale value that they receive on resale residualvalue guarantee do not constrain the customers in their ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the asset. At contract inception of a sale with a residualvalue guarantee revenue therefore has to be recognized reduced by a potential compensation payment to the customer revenue deferral. Under a contract manufacturing agreement the MercedesBenz Group sells assets to a thirdparty manufacturer from which the MercedesBenz Group buys back the manufactured products after completion of the commissioned work. If the provision of material is not associated with the transfer of control to the service provider no revenue is recognized. For certain products sold by the Group it offers extended separately priced warranties that go beyond the statutory period as well as service and maintenance contracts. Usual for such contracts is an advance payment or the payment of constant instalments over the term of the contract. If the customer has made an advance payment the revenue from these contracts is deferred as a contract liability and recognized as revenue over the term of the contract in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred based on historical information. A future loss on these contracts is recognized in the current reporting year if the expected costs for outstanding services under the contract exceed unearned revenue. For multipleelement arrangements such as when vehicles are sold with free or reducedinprice maintenance contracts or with free online services the Group generally allocates revenue to the various elements based on their estimated relative standalone selling prices. To determine standalone selling prices the MercedesBenz Group primarily uses price lists with consideration of average price reductions granted to its customers. Depending on the sales model vehicles may be initially sold to nonGroup dealers. When control of the vehicle is transferred to the nonGroup dealer the MercedesBenz Group recognizes revenue from the sale of the vehicle. Irrespective of this an end customer can decide to enter into a leasing contract with MercedesBenz Mobility regarding such a vehicle. The vehicle is then sold by the nonGroup dealer to MercedesBenz Mobility.

scenario and pessimistic scenario. The impairment amount for trade receivables is predominantly determined on a collective basis. A financial instrument is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery in whole or in part for example after the end of insolvency proceedings or after a court decision of uncollectibility. Significant modification of financial assets e.g. with a change in the present value of the contractual cash flows of also leads to derecognition of the financial assets with a simultaneous recognition of new financial assets. If the terms of a contract are renegotiated or modified and this does not result in derecognition of the contract then the gross carrying amount of the contract is recalculated and a modification gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss.Offsetting of financial instrumentsFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position provided that an enforceable right currently exists to offset the amounts involved and there is an intention either to carry out the offsetting on a net basis or to settle a liability when the related asset is sold. Financial liabilities Financial liabilities primarily include trade payables liabilities to financial institutions bonds derivative financial liabilities and other liabilities. Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost After initial recognition financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effectiveinterest method. Insofar as the MercedesBenz Group enters into reverse factoring agreements in which trade receivables of a supplier are transferred to a financial intermediary changes in the presentation of the original trade payables may occur. That would be the case if these liabilities differed in nature and function from other trade payables. As a result these liabilities would be presented separately. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial liabilities recognized at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading. Derivatives including embedded derivatives separated from the host contract which are not used as hedging instruments in hedge accounting are classified as held for trading. Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in profit or loss. Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments exclusively for hedging financial risks that arise from its operating or financing activities or liquidity management. These are mainly currency risks interest rate risks and commodity price risks.

Taxonomyeligibility is assessed in an initial step. For an economic activity to be Taxonomyeligible that activity must be mentioned and explained in further detail in the delegated acts for the Taxonomy Regulation. The EU delegated acts Commission Delegated Regulation EU and its supplement Commission Delegated Regulation EU which was adopted by the European Commission in June contain descriptions of relevant economic activities and technical screening criteria for the environmental objectives climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. The supplement to the delegated regulation includes new technical screening criteria that refer to both the existing economic activities and to new economic activities. Furthermore a new EU delegated act Commission Delegated Regulation EU containing economic activities and technical screening criteria relevant for the remaining environmental objectives was published in . The economic activities relevant to the MercedesBenz Group in this context are to be found under the environmental objectives climate change mitigation climate change adaptation and transition to a circular economy. On the basis of the descriptions contained in the delegated acts relating to climate change mitigation the following Taxonomyeligible economic activities have been identified for the Group	 Economic activity . encompasses manufacture of lowcarbon technologies for transport in connection with the production of cars and vans	 Economic activity . encompasses leasing and financing of lowcarbon cars and vans	 Economic activity . encompasses leasing and financing of lowcarbon commercial vehicles	 Economic activity . encompasses infrastructure enabling lowcarbon road transport and public transport charging infrastructureIn a Commission Notice C published by the European Commission on October the Commission stated that the term lowcarbon only relates to the assessment of Taxonomyalignment within the framework of the technical screening criteria and is not relevant for reporting on the Taxonomyeligible economic activity .. With regard to car manufacturer in particular and as an example the document shows that the activity manufacture of lowcarbon vehicles also includes vehicles with combustion engines. For the MercedesBenz Group this clarification by the European Commission means that the manufacture of all Group vehicles is to be classified as Taxonomyeligible.

Provisions for other risks Provisions are recognized when a obligation to third parties has been incurred an outflow of resources is probable and the amount of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. The amount recognized as a provision represents the best estimate of the obligation at the reporting date. Provisions with an original maturity of more than one year are discounted to the present value of the expenditures expected to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period. If the recognition criteria of provisions are not fulfilled and the possibility of a cash outflow upon settlement is not unlikely the item is to be presented as a contingent liability insofar as it is adequately measurable. The amount disclosed as a contingent liability represents the best estimate of the possible obligation at the reporting date. Provisions and contingent liabilities are regularly reviewed and adjusted as further information becomes available or circumstances change. A provision for expected warranty costs is recognized when a product is sold or when a new warranty programme is initiated. Estimates for accrued warranty costs are particularly based on historical experience. Other assumptions include but are not limited to the amount of potential repair costs. The provisions are regularly adjusted to reflect new information.Restructuring provisions are set up in connection with programmes that materially change the scope of business performed by a segment or business unit or the manner in which business is conducted. In most cases restructuring expenses include termination benefits and compensation payments due to the termination of agreements with suppliers and dealers. Benefits on termination of employment are recognized when the Group has a detailed formal plan that has either commenced implementation or been announced. Contract and refund liabilities Contract liabilities A contract liability is an entitys obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration or the amount is due from the customer. Refund liabilities A refund liability occurs if the MercedesBenz Group receives consideration from a customer and expects to refund some or all of that consideration to the customer. A refund liability is measured at the amount of consideration received for which the MercedesBenz Group does not expect to be entitled and is thus not included in the transaction price.Sharebased payment Sharebased payment comprises cashsettled liability awards. Liability awards are measured at fair value at each balance sheet date until settlement and are classified as provisions under consideration of vesting conditions.

Collectability of receivables from financial servicesThe Group regularly estimates the risk of default on receivables from financial services carrying amount as of December million December million. Many factors are taken into consideration in this context including historical loss experience the size and composition of certain portfolios current economic events and conditions and the current fair values and adequacy of collaterals. In addition to historical and current information on losses appropriate and reliable forwardlooking information on factors is also included. This information includes macroeconomic factors e.g. gross domestic product growth unemployment rate cost performance index and forecasts of future economic conditions. For receivables from financial services these forecasts are performed using a scenario analysis basic scenario optimistic scenario and pessimistic scenario. Further external information which cannot be depicted in the scenarios is as far as necessary included in the assessment through subsequent adjustments. Changes to the estimation and assessment of these factors influence the allowance for credit losses with a resulting impact on the Groups net profit. Product warranties The Group provides various types of product warranties depending on the type of product and market conditions. Provisions for product warranties carrying amount as of December million December million are generally recognized at the time of vehicle sale. In order to determine the extent of these provisions assumptions have to be made concerning the type and extent of future warranty claims and goodwill cases as well as on possible recall campaigns for each model series. These assessments are based on experience of the frequency and extent of vehicle faults and defects in the past. In addition the estimates also include assumptions on the amounts of potential repair costs per vehicle and the effects of possible time or mileage limits. The provisions are regularly adjusted to reflect new information. Liability and litigation risks and governmental proceedings Various legal proceedings claims and governmental investigations are pending against MercedesBenz Group AG and its subsidiaries on a wide range of topics. If the outcome of such legal proceedings is detrimental to the MercedesBenz Group the Group may be required to pay substantial compensatory and punitive damages to undertake service actions or recall campaigns to pay fines or to carry out other costly actions. Litigation and governmental investigations often involve complex legal issues and are connected with a high degree of uncertainty. Accordingly the assessment of whether an obligation exists on the balance sheet date as a result of an event in the past and whether a future cash outflow is likely and the obligation can be reliably estimated largely depends on estimations by the management. The MercedesBenz Group regularly evaluates the current stage of legal proceedings also with the involvement of external legal counsel. It is therefore possible that the amounts of provisions for pending or threatened proceedings will have to be regularly restated due to new expected developments. As of December the carrying amounts of provisions for liability and litigation risks are million December million.

Financial instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial instruments in the form of financial assets and financial liabilities are generally presented separately. Financial instruments are recognized as soon as the MercedesBenz Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. In the case of purchases or sales of financial assets through the regular market the MercedesBenz Group uses the transaction date as the date of initial recognition or derecognition. Upon initial recognition financial instruments are measured at fair value. For the purpose of subsequent measurement financial instruments are allocated to one of the categories mentioned in IFRS Financial Instruments financial assets measured at amortized cost financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. Transaction costs directly attributable to acquisition or issuance are considered when determining the carrying amount if the financial instruments are not measured at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets Financial assets primarily comprise receivables from financial services trade receivables receivables from banks cash on hand derivative financial assets marketable securities and similar investments and financial investments. The classification of financial instruments is based on the business model in which these instruments are held and on their contractual cash flows. The determination of the business model is carried out at the portfolio level and is based on managements intention and past transaction patterns. Assessments of the contractual cash flows are made on an instrumentbyinstrument basis. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets recognized at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets with cash flows other than those of principal and interest on the nominal amount outstanding. Furthermore financial assets that are held in a business model other than hold to collect or hold to collect and sell are included here. In addition derivatives including embedded derivatives separated from the host contract which are not classified as hedging instruments in hedge accounting as well as shares and marketable debt securities acquired for the purpose of selling in the short term that are classified as held for trading are included here. Gains or losses on these financial assets are recognized in profit or loss. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are nonderivative financial assets with contractual cash flows that consist solely of payments of principal and interest on the nominal amount outstanding and which are held to collect the contractual cash flows as well as to sell the financial assets e.g. to achieve a defined liquidity target business model hold to collect and sell.

The achievement describes the progress in the overall process of assessing all raw materials which includes fully complete and partially complete assessments. The MercedesBenz Group also carefully checks the services it uses. Services that are particularly critical from a human rights perspective were identified as part of an impact assessment. The analysis resulted in a list of services that are potentially critical in terms of human rights. We regularly conduct such risk mapping in order to address current developments and adapt our risk classification if necessary. The main human rights risks for the identified services are then determined on a stepbystep and supply chainspecific basis and appropriate measures are defined.Requirements for suppliersThe MercedesBenz Group is committed to the responsible procurement of production materials nonproduction materials and services. The Group has incorporated the guidelines for sustainable supply chain management into the Responsible Sourcing Standards RSS. They define minimum requirements and expectations for direct suppliers and contractually oblige them to comply with these requirements to communicate them to their employees and upstream stages of the value chain and to monitor compliance with them in their business processes and sphere of influence.The goal here is to prevent minimize or if possible bring to an end any negative impacts on human rights worldwide. The RSS are an integral part of all new orders for Tier suppliers and the key contractual document for minimum and sustainability requirements. They are applied worldwide.Measures in the supply chainThe MercedesBenz Group uses a variety of measures and concepts to ensure the fulfilment of its due diligence obligations in the supply chain. This includes training preventive and corrective measures risk analyses documentation for tracking and reporting purposes and effectiveness checks. With these instruments the MercedesBenz Group intends to increase transparency in the supply chain and to ensure that internationally recognized human rights are upheld by business partners as well and that other social standards and environmental requirements are met. The procurement units for production materials nonproduction materials and services play a key role here.In addition Tier suppliers were continuously screened for human rights violations and breaches of environmental standards in the reporting year. The objective is to identify possible violations at an early stage on the basis of the latest supplier data.

During the reporting period a positive effect resulted from the development of the working capital mainly due to a lower inventory buildup and a decrease in the trade receivables compared to the previous year. A smaller increase in trade payables compared to the previous year had an opposing effect.In the previous year the free cash flow was also impacted by higher payments resulting from the settlement of civil and environmental claims made by several US authorities in in connection with emission control systems used in certain diesel vehicles as well as higher payments in connection with restructuring measures. Another positive effect resulted from a lower increase in the number of leased vehicles compared to the previous year. Moreover higher dividend payments were received during the reporting period from equitymethod investments in particular Daimler Truck Holding AG and Beijing Benz Automotive Co. Ltd. Investments in and disposals of shareholdings and other business operations resulted in slightly higher cash inflows in the reporting period than in the previous year.There was an increase in income taxes paid in comparison to the prior year which resulted from the improvement in earnings before taxes in the industrial business. In addition to payments to the tax authorities income tax payments also include intraGroup payments and refunds based on contractual arrangements within the tax groups. A further negative effect on the free cash flow of the industrial business resulted from the higher investment in intangible assets and capital expenditure on property plant and equipment.

If in connection with contracts a worsening of payment behaviour or other causes of a credit risk are recognized collection procedures are initiated by claims management to obtain the overdue payments of the customer to take possession of the asset financed or leased or alternatively to renegotiate the impaired contract. Internal restructuring policies and practices for loan and leasing contracts are based on the indicators or criteria which in the judgement of local management indicate that repayment will probably continue and that the total proceeds expected to be derived from the renegotiated contract exceed the expected proceeds to be derived from immediate repossession and remarketing. In the case of receivables from financial services significant modifications of financial assets were only made in rare cases and to an insignificant extent. The allowance ratio decreased compared to the previous year due to the sale of the Russian MercedesBenz Mobility companies for which very high provisions were recorded in . The default rate has increased compared to the very low figures in the previous year mainly due to a challenging lending environment in the United States. For information on credit risks included in receivables from financial services see Note . Information on the measurement of expected credit losses is provided in Note . Trade receivables Trade receivables are mostly receivables from worldwide sales of vehicles and spare parts. The credit risk from trade receivables encompasses the default risk of customers e.g. dealers and general distribution companies as well as other corporate and private customers. In order to identify credit risks the MercedesBenz Group assesses the creditworthiness of customers. The MercedesBenz Group manages its credit risk from trade receivables using appropriate IT applications and databases on the basis of internal policies which have to be followed Groupwide. A significant proportion of the trade receivables from each countrys domestic business is secured by various countryspecific types of collateral. This collateral includes conditional sales guarantees and sureties as well as mortgages and deposits from customers. For trade receivables from the export business the MercedesBenz Group also evaluates its customers creditworthiness by means of an internal rating process with consideration of the respective country risk. In this context the Annual Financial Statements and other relevant information on the general distribution companies such as payment history are used and assessed. Depending on the creditworthiness of the customers the MercedesBenz Group establishes credit limits and limits credit risks with the following types of collateral credit insurancesfirstclass bank guarantees andletters of credit. These procedures are defined in the export credit guidelines which have Groupwide validity. For impairments of trade receivables the simplified approach is applied according to which these receivables are allocated to stage . Credit losses until maturity for these trade receivables are recognized upon initial recognition. Further information on trade receivables and the status of loss allowances recognized is provided in Note .

The MercedesBenz Group does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if at contract inception it is expected that the period between the transfer of a promised asset or service to a customer and payment by the customer will be no longer than one year. Revenue also includes revenue from the rental and leasing business as well as interest from the financial services business at MercedesBenz Mobility. Revenue generated from operating leases is recognized on a straightline basis over the periods of the contracts. In addition sales revenue is generated at the end of lease contracts from the subsequent sale of the vehicles. Revenue from receivables from financial services is recognized using the effectiveinterest method. The MercedesBenz Group uses a variety of sales promotion programmes dependent on various market conditions in individual countries as well as the respective product life cycles and productrelated factors such as amounts of discounts offered by competitors excess industry production capacity the intensity of market competition and consumer demand for the products. These programmes comprise cash offers to dealers and customers as well as lease subsidies or loans at reduced interest rates which are reported as followsRevenue is recognized net of sales reductions such as cash discounts and sales incentives granted.When loans are issued below market rates related receivables are recognized at present value using market rates and revenue is reduced for the interest incentive granted.If subsidised leasing fees are agreed upon in connection with finance leases revenue from the sale of a vehicle is reduced by the amount of the interest incentive granted.

Contracts for the purchase or sale of nonfinancial items are regularly qualified as executory contracts and thus treated as suspended transactions although they fulfil the definition of a derivative. If such contracts do not meet the criteria for executory contracts they are recorded as derivatives. These derivatives are measured at fair value through profit or loss. The valuation effects are reported in the functional costs in which the consumption of the procured nonfinancial items e.g. energy is reported. Embedded derivatives are principally separated from the host contract and recognized separately. However embedded derivatives are not separated from the host contract if that host contract is a financial asset if the MercedesBenz Group chooses to measure a hybrid contract at fair value through profit or loss or if the embedded derivative is closely related to the host contract. Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value upon initial recognition and at each subsequent reporting date. The fair value of listed derivatives is equal to their positive or negative market value. If a market value is not available fair value is calculated using standard financial valuation models such as discounted cash flow or optionpricing models. Derivatives are recognized as assets if their fair value is positive and as liabilities if their fair value is negative. If the requirements for hedge accounting set out in IFRS are met the MercedesBenz Group designates and documents the hedge relationship from the date a derivative contract is entered into as a fairvalue hedge a cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign business operation. In a fairvalue hedge the changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment are hedged. In a cash flow hedge highly probable future cash flows from expected transactions or variable cash flows to be paid or received related to a recognized asset or liability are hedged. The documentation of the hedging relationship includes the objectives and strategy of risk management the type of hedging relationship the nature of the risk being hedged the identification of the eligible hedging instrument and the eligible hedged item as well as an assessment of the effectiveness requirements comprising the risk mitigating economic relationship the absence of deteriorating effects from credit risk and the appropriate hedge ratio. The effectiveness of the hedge is assessed at the start of and during the hedging relationship. Changes in fair value of nondesignated derivatives are recognized in profit or loss. For fairvalue hedges changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and the hedged item are recognized in profit or loss. For cash flow hedges fairvalue changes in the effective portion of derivative financial instruments are recognized after tax in other comprehensive income. Effects from hedging are presented in the item of the Statement of Income in which the underlying transaction is effective. Under IFRS for cash flow hedges in procurement transactions expected with a high degree of probability designation can be made for separable risk components of these nonfinancial hedged items. Under IFRS with cash flow hedges amounts recognized in other comprehensive income as effective hedging gains or losses from hedging instruments are removed from the reserves for derivative financial instruments and directly included in the initial cost or carrying amount of the hedged item at initial recognition if the hedged item e.g. the forecast transaction results in the recognition of a nonfinancial asset or nonfinancial liability. For other cash flow hedges the accumulated hedging gains or losses from hedging instruments are reclassified from the reserves for derivative financial instruments to the Consolidated Statement of Income when the hedged item affects profit or loss. Insofar as currency translation effects recognized in profit or loss due to trade receivables and payables are connected with the underlying hedged transactions simultaneously occurring hedging gainslosses are reclassified in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The ineffective portions of fairvalue changes are recognized directly in profit or loss.

Equipment on operating leases only takes into account vehicles acquired by dealers from outside the Group. Goodwill acquired is not taken into account here.

contract between MercedesBenz Mobility and the end customer constitutes a sublease in this respect. Accounting for and classification of a sublease depend on whether the contracts were concluded before or after the legal spinoff and hivedown of Daimlers commercial vehicle business. The leases that were concluded before the legal spinoff and hivedown are continued as operating leases. The head lease is presented under equipment on operating leases as a right of use which was recognized at fair value at the spinoff date and subsequently depreciated on a straightline basis. In addition a residualvalue receivable from the companies of the Daimler Truck Group is recognized. However the leasing contracts concluded after the legal spinoff and hivedown are classified and accounted for as finance leases. The net investment in the lease corresponds to the rightofuse asset from the head lease. In addition to the finance lease MercedesBenz Mobility recognizes a residualvalue receivable from the Daimler Truck Group in the amount of the guaranteed residual value. The head lease is not recorded separately. Impairment of noncurrent nonfinancial assetsThe MercedesBenz Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired or whether there is an indication that a previously recognized impairment loss may be reversed. If such indication exists the MercedesBenz Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. The recoverable amount is determined for each individual asset unless the asset generates cash inflows that are not largely independent of those from other assets or other groups of assets cashgenerating units. An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may be reversed. If this is the case the MercedesBenz Group records a partial or entire reversal of the impairment the carrying amount is thereby increased to the recoverable amount. However the increased carrying amount may not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined net of scheduled depreciation if no impairment loss had been recognized in prior years. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested at least annually for impairment. This takes place at the level of the cashgenerating units. The cashgenerating units MercedesBenz Cars and MercedesBenz Vans basically correspond to the segments. At MercedesBenz Mobility impairment testing is carried out below segment level. A distinction is made between the two cashgenerating units MercedesBenz Mobility Classic traditional financial services business and Charging Solutions development of a highpower charging network. As the Charging Solutions cashgenerating unit had neither goodwill nor other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in and there was no indication of impairment in it was not necessary to calculate the recoverable amount. If it is determined that the carrying amount of an asset or of a cashgenerating unit exceeds the recoverable amount an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For cashgenerating units the MercedesBenz Group in a first step determines the respective recoverable amount as value in use and compares it with the respective carrying amount including goodwill. If value in use is lower than the carrying amount fair value less costs of disposal is additionally calculated to determine the recoverable amount.

To secure obligations from partial retirement and longterm working accounts a number of company cars and demonstration vehicles included in inventories of MercedesBenz AG in the amount of million is pledged as collateral to MercedesBenz Pension Trust e.V. as of December million. The increase in carrying amount is due to the significantly higher inventory levels as well as the on average more expensive vehicle prices.

market interest rates appropriate to the remaining terms of the financial instruments. derivative commodity hedging contracts the fair values of commodity hedging contracts e.g. commodity forwards are determined on the basis of current reference prices with consideration of forward premiums and discounts and default risks. Other financial receivables and other financial assets are carried at amortized cost. Because of the predominantly short maturities and the fundamentally lower credit risk of these financial instruments it is assumed that the fair values approximate the carrying amounts. Financing liabilities Financing liabilities are measured at amortized cost. The fair values of bonds loans commercial paper deposits in the direct banking business and liabilities from ABS transactions are calculated as present values of the estimated future cash flows taking account of credit premiums and credit risks. Market interest rates for the appropriate terms are used for discounting. Trade payables Due to the short maturities of these financial instruments it is assumed that their fair values are equal to the carrying amounts. Reverse factoring agreements did not change the relevant characteristics of a trade payable for the Group for the liabilities concerned. As a result there were no reclassifications of these trade payables to financing liabilities. Contract and refund liabilities Contract and refund liabilities include obligations from sales transactions that qualify as financial instruments. Obligations from sales transactions should generally be regarded as current. Due to the short maturities of these financial instruments it is assumed that their fair values are equal to the carrying amounts. Other financial liabilities Financial liabilities recognized at fair value through profit or loss comprise derivative financial instruments not used in hedge accounting. For information regarding these financial instruments as well as derivative financial instruments used in hedge accounting see the notes above under Marketable debt securities and similar investments other financial assets. Miscellaneous other financial liabilities are carried at amortized cost. Because of the predominantly short maturities of these financial instruments it is assumed that the fair values approximate the carrying amounts.

One of the important goals of the Commission Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth in the context of the European Green Deal is to divert capital flows to sustainable investments. This is also the logic behind the EU Taxonomy Regulation EU that came into force in mid. This regulation governs the establishment of a standardized and legally binding classification system that defines the types of economic activity in the EU that are considered to be Taxonomyaligned and thus environmentally sustainable with regard to six environmental objectives established by the regulation 	 Climate change mitigation	 Climate change adaptation	 Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources	 Transition to a circular economy	 Pollution prevention and control	 Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystemsCompanies that are required to publish a NonFinancial Declaration must also comply with the Taxonomy Regulation.

Profit measureThe measure of operating profit at the divisional level is EBIT earnings before interest and income taxes. EBIT thus reflects the divisions responsibility for profit and loss. EBIT that is calculated at the Group level takes into account centrally managed matters and eliminations.In order to provide a more transparent presentation of our ongoing business adjusted EBIT is also calculated and reported for both the Group and the divisions. The adjustments include individual items insofar as they lead to material effects in a reporting year. These individual items can relate in particular to legal proceedings and related measures restructuring measures and MA transactions. Group EBIT minus the centrally managed income taxes equals net operating profit. The chapter Profitability shows how net operating profit is calculated. Return on salesAs one of the main factors influencing value added return on sales is of particular importance for assessing the profitability of the automotive divisions. Return on sales is the ratio of EBIT to revenue and vehicle sales are the primary source of revenue. The measure of profitability for MercedesBenz Mobility is not return on sales but return on equity the ratio of EBIT to average equity on a quarterly basis. On the basis of adjusted EBIT an adjusted return on sales is reported for the automotive divisions and an adjusted return on equity is reported for MercedesBenz Mobility.Net assetsAll assets liabilities and provisions for which the automotive divisions are responsible in daytoday operations are allocated to them. Performance measurement at MercedesBenz Mobility is implemented on an equity basis. Net assets at the Group level include the net operating assets of the automotive divisions and the equity of MercedesBenz Mobility as well as assets and liabilities from income taxes and other reconciling items which are not allocated to the divisions. The average annual net assets are calculated on the basis of the average quarterly net assets. Cash flowA change in net assets for example as a result of investments generally leads to the application or release of liquid funds. Along with earnings net assets thus also have a direct effect on the cash flow. Of outstanding importance for the financial strength of the MercedesBenz Group is the free cash flow of the industrial business which comprises the cash flows at the automotive divisions and the cash flows from interest taxes and other reconciling items that cannot be allocated to the divisions. The operating cash flow before interest and taxes CFBIT for the automotive divisions is derived from EBIT and the change in net assets. The cash conversion rate CCR is the ratio of CFBIT to EBIT over a period of time and is an important measure for cashflow management at the automotive divisions. In order to provide a more transparent presentation of our ongoing business the adjusted free cash flow of the industrial business and the adjusted CFBIT of the automotive divisions are also calculated and reported. An adjusted cash conversion rate adjusted CCR on the basis of adjusted CFBIT and adjusted EBIT is presented for the automotive divisions. The adjustments include individual items insofar as they lead to material effects in a reporting year. These individual items can relate in particular to legal proceedings and related measures restructuring measures and MA transactions.

Receivables from financial services The MercedesBenz Groups financing and leasing activities are primarily focused on supporting the sales of the Groups automotive products. As a consequence of these activities the Group is exposed to credit risk which is monitored and managed based on defined standards guidelines and procedures. The MercedesBenz Group manages its credit risk irrespective of whether it is related to a financing contract or to an operating lease or a finance lease contract. For this reason statements concerning the credit risk of MercedesBenz Mobility refer to the entire financing and leasing business unless otherwise specified. Exposure to credit risk from financing and lease activities is monitored based on the portfolio subject to credit risk. The portfolio subject to credit risk consists of wholesale and retail receivables from financial services and the portion of the operating lease portfolio that is subject to credit risk. Receivables from financial services comprise claims arising from finance lease contracts and repayment claims from financing loans. The operating lease portfolio is reported under equipment on operating leases in the Groups Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Lease payments due from operating lease contracts are recognized in receivables from financial services. The MercedesBenz Mobility segment has policies setting the framework for effective risk management at a global as well as a local level. In particular these policies deal with minimum requirements for all riskrelevant credit processes the definition of financing products offered the evaluation of customer quality requests for collateral and the treatment of unsecured loans and nonperforming claims. The limitation of concentration risks is implemented primarily by means of global limits which refer to customer exposures. To comply with these limits MercedesBenz Mobility applies approval standards and measures to avoid concentration risks. Only one customer was granted a credit line in the form of a large loan. The MercedesBenz Mobility portfolio consists of a large number of small and mediumsized enterprises and private customers from more than countries. At December this segment accounted for of the portfolio. With respect to its financing and lease activities the Group holds collateral for customer transactions limiting actual credit risk through its fair value. The value of collateral generally depends on the amount of the financed assets. The financed vehicles usually serve as collateral. Furthermore MercedesBenz Mobility limits credit risk from financing and lease activities for example through deposits from customers. For the assessment of the default risk of retail and small business customers scoring systems are applied to evaluate their creditworthiness. Corporate customers are evaluated using internal rating instruments. Both evaluation processes use external credit bureau data if available. The scoring and rating results as well as the availability of security and other risk mitigation instruments such as deposits guarantees and to a lesser extent residual debt insurances are essential elements for credit decisions.

The table Carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments shows the carrying amounts and fair values of the respective classes of the Groups financial instruments and contain the Group amounts including assets and liabilities held for sale. The fair values of financial instruments were calculated on the basis of market information available on the balance sheet date. The following methods and assumptions were used. Receivables from financial services The fair values of receivables from financial services with variable interest rates are estimated to be equal to the respective carrying amounts because the agreed upon interest rates and those available in the market do not significantly differ. The fair values of receivables from financial services with fixed interest rates are determined on the basis of discounted expected future cash flows. Discounting is based on the current interest rates at which similar loans with identical terms could have been obtained at December and December . Trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents Due to the short terms and the fundamentally lower credit risk of these financial instruments it is assumed that their fair values are equal to the carrying amounts.Marketable debt securities and similar investments other financial assets Marketable debt securities are recognized at fair value through other comprehensive income or at fair value through profit or loss. Similar investments are measured at amortized cost and are not included in the measurement hierarchy as their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair value due to the short terms of these financial instruments and the fundamentally low credit risk. Equity instruments are recognized at fair value through other comprehensive income or at fair value through profit or loss. Equity instruments recognized at fair value through other comprehensive income are included in the table Carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments and primarily comprise the shares in Sila Nanotechnologies Inc. Momenta Global Limited and Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings Plc. The remaining investments recognized at fair value through other comprehensive income comprise further investments not material on an individual basis. Marketable debt securities and equity instruments recognized at fair value were measured using quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period. If quoted market prices are not available for these debt and equity instruments fair value measurement is based on inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable in active markets. Fair values are calculated using recognized financial valuation models such as discounted cash flow models or multiples. Other financial assets recognized at fair value through profit or loss relate to derivative financial instruments not used in hedge accounting. These financial instruments as well as derivative financial instruments used in hedge accounting comprise derivative currency hedging contracts the fair values of crosscurrency interest rate swaps are determined on the basis of the discounted estimated future cash flows taking account of credit premiums and default risks using the market interest rates appropriate to the remaining terms of the financial instruments. The measurement of currency forwards is based on market quotes of forward curves.

Taxation for Groups of Companies Minimum Tax Act MinStG and is applicable to the MercedesBenz Group from January . As part of an analysis of possible effects on the Group no countries were identified as at the reporting date from which significant effects are to be expected with regard to the possible payment of a minimum tax. To introduce a mandatory temporary exemption from the requirements in IAS Income Taxes for the recording and disclosure of information about deferred tax assets and liabilities the IASB published International Tax Reform Pillar Model Rules Amendments to IAS in May . The MercedesBenz Group applies the exception rule according to IAS which stipulates that no deferred tax assets and liabilities are accounted for in connection with the income taxes of the second pillar Pillar of the OECD. In May the IASB published the standard IFRS Insurance Contracts. IFRS establishes more transparency and comparability with regard to the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts with the insurer. The application of IFRS is mandatory for reporting periods beginning on or after January . The firsttime application of IFRS had no impact on the profitability liquidity and capital resources and financial position of the MercedesBenz Group. In addition other standards and interpretations were published which are not expected to have any significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Presentation Presentation in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position differentiates between current and noncurrent assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities are generally classified as current if they are expected to be realized or settled within one year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as assets and provisions for pensions and similar obligations are presented as noncurrent items. The Consolidated Statement of Income is presented using the costofsales method. Principles of consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the financial statements of MercedesBenz Group AG and the financial statements of all subsidiaries including structured entities which are directly or indirectly controlled by MercedesBenz Group AG. Control exists if the parent company has the power of decision over a subsidiary based on voting rights or other rights if it participates in positive and negative variable returns from a subsidiary and if it can affect these returns by its power of decision.Structured entities are entities which have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not relevant in deciding who controls the entity. This is the case for example if voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements. The financial statements of consolidated subsidiaries which are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are generally prepared as of the reporting date of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The financial statements of MercedesBenz Group AG and its companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared using uniform recognition and measurement principles. IntraGroup assets and liabilities equity income and expenses as well as cash flows from transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated in the course of the consolidation process. Business combinations and changes in equity interestsBusiness combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. In connection with obtaining control noncontrolling interest in the acquiree is in principle recognized at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable assets which are measured at fair value. Changes in equity interests in subsidiaries that reduce or increase the MercedesBenz Groups percentage ownership without a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions between owners.
