Provisions for other risks Provisions are recognized when a obligation to third parties has been incurred an outflow of resources is probable and the amount of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. The amount recognized as a provision represents the best estimate of the obligation at the reporting date. Provisions with an original maturity of more than one year are discounted to the present value of the expenditures expected to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period. If the recognition criteria of provisions are not fulfilled and the possibility of a cash outflow upon settlement is not unlikely the item is to be presented as a contingent liability insofar as it is adequately measurable. The amount disclosed as a contingent liability represents the best estimate of the possible obligation at the reporting date. Provisions and contingent liabilities are regularly reviewed and adjusted as further information becomes available or circumstances change. A provision for expected warranty costs is recognized when a product is sold or when a new warranty programme is initiated. Estimates for accrued warranty costs are particularly based on historical experience. Other assumptions include but are not limited to the amount of potential repair costs. The provisions are regularly adjusted to reflect new information.Restructuring provisions are set up in connection with programmes that materially change the scope of business performed by a segment or business unit or the manner in which business is conducted. In most cases restructuring expenses include termination benefits and compensation payments due to the termination of agreements with suppliers and dealers. Benefits on termination of employment are recognized when the Group has a detailed formal plan that has either commenced implementation or been announced. Contract and refund liabilities Contract liabilities A contract liability is an entitys obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration or the amount is due from the customer. Refund liabilities A refund liability occurs if the MercedesBenz Group receives consideration from a customer and expects to refund some or all of that consideration to the customer. A refund liability is measured at the amount of consideration received for which the MercedesBenz Group does not expect to be entitled and is thus not included in the transaction price.Sharebased payment Sharebased payment comprises cashsettled liability awards. Liability awards are measured at fair value at each balance sheet date until settlement and are classified as provisions under consideration of vesting conditions. The profit or loss of the period equals the addition to andor the reversal of the provision during the reporting period and the dividend equivalent paid during the period and is included in functional costs.

From the current perspective the retained earnings of nonGerman subsidiaries are largely intended to be reinvested in those operations. The Group did not recognize deferred tax liabilities on retained earnings which are intended to be reinvested at nonGerman subsidiaries of million million. If those earnings were paid out as dividends an amount of would be taxed under German taxation rules and if applicable with nonGerman withholding tax. Additionally other income tax consequences might arise if the dividends first have to be distributed by a nonGerman subsidiary to a nonGerman holding company. Normally the distribution would lead to an additional income tax expense. Estimating the amount of taxable temporary differences for these undistributed foreign earnings would require a disproportionate effort. The Group has various unresolved issues concerning open tax years. The MercedesBenz Group believes that it has recognized adequate liabilities for any future income taxes that may be owed for all open tax years. Nevertheless it cannot be ruled out that tax payments might exceed the liabilities recognized in the financial statements. As a result of future adjudications or changes in the opinions of the fiscal authorities it cannot be ruled out that the MercedesBenz Group might receive tax refunds for previous years. In particular from to MercedesBenz Group AG incurred currency exchangerate related losses from the financing of Group companies based abroad totalling . billion which were compensated by corresponding hedging instruments. For the years until the German tax authorities consider that exchangerate related losses from the financing of Group companies are generally not to be recognized while the compensating profits from the hedging activities remain taxable. In the German Modernization of Corporate Income Tax Act stipulated that such exchangerate losses are generally deductible. However this only applies from onwards. The Company does not share the legal opinion represented by the tax authorities for the years up to . In the meantime a lawsuit has also been filed with the Finance Court.

Revenue in was slightly above the previous years level. The increase in revenue was primarily due to higher unit sales and improved pricing at the MercedesBenz Vans segment. Revenue in the MercedesBenz Cars segment was also higher primarily due to a further improvement in pricing. However negative exchangerate effects had an opposing effect causing a reduction in revenue. Revenue disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Income includes revenue from contracts with customers which are in the scope of IFRS revenue according to IFRS and other revenue not in the scope of IFRS . The composition of the revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income is shown by region in Note . Revenue according to IFRS is disaggregated by the two categories type of products and services and geographical regions. The category type of products and services corresponds to the reported segments. Revenue according to IFRS includes revenue that was included in contract liabilities at December in an amount of million million and revenue from performance obligations fully or partially satisfied in previous periods in an amount of million million. Revenue related to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied by the end of the reporting period that is expected to be recognized within three years amounted to million at December million. This revenue is mainly derived from longterm service and maintenance contracts and extended warranties. It does not include performance obligations from customer contracts that have initial expected durations of one year or less. The number of vehicles for which the expected original delivery time will exceed twelve months was immaterial and is therefore not part of the disclosed amount. Longterm performance obligations of minor importance to the overall contract value of a bundled contract are not considered in assessing the initial duration of the bundled contract.
