357,In this section we provide information on our key intangible resources in accordance with Article Section of the Directive EU Accounting Directive as amended by the Directive EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive which are those intangible resources on which our business model fundamentally depends. This includes an explanation of how our business model fundamentally depends on such resources and how such resources are a source of value creation for Zalando.,0.34581433184450944,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
358,Zalando defines and categorises intangible resources intangibles considering the IIRC and WICI Frameworks.,0.381377505129001,,,0.3217953035892313,,,,,,,,,0.3479807036326289,,,,,0.2505705025820364,
359, Intangibles are defined as all nonmonetary and nonphysical resources that either alone or in conjunction with other resources can generate a positive or negative effect on the value of Zalando in the short medium or longterm. Intangible resources include intangibles that are both recognised or not recognised in our consolidated statement of financial position for further details on recognised intangibles see sections .. Accounting policies and .. . Intangible assets. We group intangibles into three main categories,0.31330906388465124,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
363, This is why we will continuously invest in these areas through our growth initiatives that we have defined.We have classified our intangible resources into the three categories mentioned above. However there will always be an overlap between the different categories. For this reason the classification is based on how we understand each different category and its respective characteristics as well as the characteristics of our intangible resources. Furthermore in most cases value creation within a company is not the output of a separate resource it is the result of interactions between intangible and tangible resources within the dynamic system of a large group like Zalando. Hence there is always a dependency between resources and our business model depends on the successful interaction of all our resources. It is therefore not reasonable to quantify an individual positive or negative effect these resources may have on the value creation for Zalando.,0.3515084336122109,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3856000158198432,,,,,

534,Pursuant to recommendation G. sentence of the GCGC referring to each forthcoming financial year the supervisory board shall establish performance criteria for each management board member covering all variable remuneration components such performance criteria mainly being besides operating targets strategic targets. The new remuneration system for the management board members which came into effect on May Remuneration System complies with all recommendations of the GCGC. In particular all variable remuneration components under the Remuneration System are linked to the achievement of performance criteria. The Remuneration System applies to all service contracts of the management board members concluded from May onwards. It was already applied in the course of the conclusion of new services agreements for four of the five management board members with effect from September from October or from January respectively. The service agreement of the other management board member expires as of February . We also intend to comply with all recommendations of the GCGC in accordance with the Remuneration System for all future management board service agreements to be concluded after the issuance of this declaration of conformity.For the remuneration granted until the effectiveness of the respective new service agreements of the management board members and the expiry of the service agreement as of February the remuneration system for the management board which became effective as of June Remuneration System continued and continues to apply. For the remuneration granted under the Remuneration System the deviation from the recommendation G. remains in place because one of the two variable components the Zalando Ownership Plan ZOP does not provide for specific performance criteria. The ZOP is a sharebased remuneration component which is as such linked to the share price increase to ensure alignment with the shareholders interest. The other variable remuneration component under the Remuneration System the longterm incentive plan LTI which accounts for the largest share in the total compensation is also sharebased and is linked to strategic performance targets including financial and ESG criteria. ,,0.3449173494628097,,,,0.35715790227762895,,0.36556566872648594,,0.3227370669148212,,,,,,0.3623445132339001,,,

726,Identification and assessment of material IROsWe finalised our first DMA at the beginning of . This comprehensive framework allows us to evaluate and disclose ESGrelated IROs. The DMAapproach goes beyond the traditional materiality approach and also considers outwardlooking impacts such as those on the environment society and the economy as well as inwardlooking risks and opportunities related to sustainability. As a way of aligning our business performance with the expectations of our stakeholders and society at large the DMA provides a profound understanding of different perspectives. The results of the DMA were used in combination with upstream and downstream stakeholder feedback from civil society organisations industry regulators and investors as well as research conducted to gather feedback on the direction of our strategic goals. We will update our assessment periodically to align with changes in our business operations and external circumstances. We leveraged our due diligence processes to conduct the DMA by identifying assessing and prioritising impacts engaging with stakeholders and following the systematic steps outlined below. The identification of IROs was informed by our operational processes and these IROs were subsequently incorporated into the DMA. Examples of processes where we identified IROs related to the environment and society are as follows,,,0.374199320650762,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

732,Climate and nature risk assessmentThrough the DMA we identified sustainability matters that are material to our stakeholder groups. These represent the most material sustainability considerations for our business and performance with potential impacts in the shortterm reporting year mediumterm up to years or longterm years. Our previous materiality assessment was conducted in . Following the adoption of the final ESRS we have been applying the DMA approach since to gain a deeper understanding of the interests and concerns of our key stakeholders.Step Longlist and shortlist of topics identificationTo establish a foundation for our DMA we conducted a comprehensive review encompassing over ESG topics. The compilation of topics was informed by legal mandates notably ESRS alongside external reports including industry and global risk reports peer and consumer publications ESG reporting frameworks our prior materiality assessment and input from employees. These topics were meticulously categorised and grouped into a condensed list of subjects for deeper examination. Ultimately a final list of topics for assessment was derived aimed at determining the material considerations pertinent to us.,0.32716139181308135,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
733,Step Detailed IRO identification We conducted a detailed analysis of our value chain to evaluate the impacts of our operations and the risks opportunities and dependencies related to the identified sustainability topics. We assessed the primary activities and impacts within our entire value chain and our own operations. Our internal teams collaborated to identify the environmental social and governance IROs. We specifically analysed the key materials sourced the production of raw materials the manufacturing processes and the primary regions from which we source. We examined our business model to confirm that no significant variations in IRO profiles were observed across our segments that would necessitate further steps in the materiality analysis. Additionally we mapped the IROs across our value chain in terms of time horizons and our role in relation to the impacts or risks and opportunities.Step IRO assessment IROs were assessed via categories defined by the ESRS. Impact materiality considers the likelihood and severity of impacts and financial materiality considers the likelihood and magnitude of potential financial effects. In the case of a potential negative human rights impact the severity of the impact takes precedence over its likelihood.Impact materiality scoring methodology The impacts were assessed and rated based on their severity and likelihood. Severity is determined by factors such as scale scope and irremediable character as outlined in ESRS . The severity and likelihood of impacts were scored on a scale ranging from low to high for positive and negative impacts refer to the tables below.,0.28985072600890505,,0.4402317805501767,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

755,Threshold setting and material matters definitionAn ESG topic is material to us based on the impact of our activities on the environment and people across the value chain. An ESG topic is material from a financial perspective if it triggers financial effects on the organisation by potentially generating risks or opportunities that influence or are likely to influence the current situation future development financial position cash flows access to capital and the cost of capital and therefore the enterprise value of Zalando in the short medium or longterm but is not included in the financial reporting at the reporting date.The final IRO scores based on the above methodologies range between a minimum of and a maximum of . The impact materiality threshold is set at . and the financial materiality threshold is set at . This means that IROs scoring above these values and their associated ESRS topic are deemed material ensuring that only the most significant matters are addressed reflecting a strategic alignment with organisational goals and stakeholder expectations. Further information on the application of materiality of information is disclosed as part of the respective disclosure requirements.The material topics are organised into three main categories and our policies actions targets and metrics related to these material topics are discussed in the respective chapters E S and G of our sustainability statement.Biodiversity and ecosystemsWe did not identify biodiversity and ecosystem impacts as material however to comply with the requirements of ESRS . we have disclosed the information required by ESRS E related to IRO. We identified and assessed actual and potential IROs on biodiversity and ecosystems for our own operations as well as across our upstream and downstream value chain. The assessment included an evaluation of dependencies on biodiversity and ecosystems and their services and was informed by an external report that offered insights into biodiversity and ecosystem services. The same assessment criteria and ranges as outlined above were applied. We identified and assessed transition risks including reputational regulatory and market risks related to biodiversity loss as well as physical risks and opportunities related to biodiversity and ecosystems. We considered systemic risks to the extent that negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems might jeopardise the availability of relevant ecosystem services such as raw materials for production and might also result in reputational effects. One driver for this could be for example the introduction of invasive or alien species through activities in our value chain. We did not conduct direct consultations with affected communities regarding the sustainability assessment of shared biological resources and ecosystems. For details on how we actively collaborated with stakeholders likely to be affected by our activities please refer to the stakeholder engagement information above.Sites located in biodiversitysensitive areas As an online fashion retailer and platform with a focus on ecommerce logistics and customer services we concentrated on assessing our own office locations fulfilment and return centres operated by us on our behalf or by a third party as well as those sites within our value chain linked to the production Tier of our ,0.43808550302369004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on our assessment which was conducted using the Natura network of protected areas the UNESCO World Heritage sites and Key Biodiversity Areas KBAs we did not identify any sites located in biodiversitysensitive areas. For we have not yet assessed whether we have sites located near biodiversitysensitive areas but we are planning to conduct this assessment in . Based on this we have determined that the implementation of measures to mitigate risks relating to biodiversitysensitive areas is not required at this time.List of ESRS disclosure requirementsIn our sustainability statement we have adhered to the disclosure requirements outlined by the ESRS as shown in the Index List of ESRS disclosure requirements of our Appendix. Additionally we have included a list of all data points derived from other EU legislation as listed in Appendix B of ESRS .Material IROs and their interaction with strategy and business modelWe evaluated the relevance of sustainabilityrelated IROs from a gross impact perspective. This approach excludes the consideration of our management practices during the assessment. In the following chapters covering the ESG dimensions we explain our management practices for addressing our material IROs.The following materiality matrix offers a brief overview of the DMA results categorised according to both impact materiality and financial materiality dimensions.,0.3370631723814697,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

762,Material IROs list The detailed DMA results are listed in the table below according to the order of the ESRS. The material sustainability matters are structured in alignment with the ESRS in topics subtopics and subsubtopics. The table outlines the level of our responsibility and the associated triggers for each material IRO. For each identified impact we evaluated whether it leads to risks or opportunities particularly those arising from dependencies on key resources such as natural human or financial capital.Additionally the assessment considers not only risks and opportunities directly linked to identified impacts but also those that stem from resource dependencies where no direct impact may be observed. This ensures that risks and opportunities that arise independently of specific impacts such as broader market or resource dynamics are also captured in our analysis. This comprehensive approach helps us identify potential risks and opportunities both impactrelated and nonimpactrelated ensuring a thorough understanding of our sustainability landscape. The table includes information on the level of responsibility that each material IRO entails. This responsibility is categorised as caused contributed or linked to. These triggers can stem from factors within our control our business relationships or our dependencies on external resources. In the table VC refers to the value chain and OO stands for own operations covering our direct activities. The time horizons are aligned to ESRS and divided into actual year which reflects immediate realised impacts and potential years or beyond years which captures longerterm forecasted or anticipated impacts. ,0.29426517345551273,0.34530576417140924,0.46703565894169397,,0.4019183257557912,0.32300733632713313,,,,,,,,,,,,,

793,The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems We conducted updated assessments of economic activities under all six environmental objectives. This review did not result in any change to our previously identified material Taxonomyeligible economic activities hence we still only report on the CapEx related to the leasing of our buildings and the corresponding OpEx economic activity . listed in Annex I of the Delegated Regulation EU . In the financial year we expanded the number of leased buildings which led to additional rightofuse assets of .m EUR prior year .m EUR. This is material from our group perspective and is therefore reported as Taxonomyeligible CapEx. The additions mainly relate to a new fulfilment centre in France as well as a new office building and new outlets in Germany.We calculated total CapEx as additions to intangible assets property plant and equipment as well as rightofuse assets excluding any remeasurements for the financial year as disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under .. .

Rightofuse assets and lease liabilities.,0.4974100587994963,0.3321513457946512,0.38370383212670983,0.3540761009567569,0.4512173685719346,0.3580998387448994,,,0.34278855613645687,,,0.38467828257178366,,0.38266552603666426,,,,,
794, Additions to rightofuse assets of .m EUR prior year .m EUR as disclosed in the notes also include .m EUR prior year .m EUR related to remeasurements that are not included in total CapEx. Total CapEx for the financial year therefore amounts to .m EUR prior year .m EUR resulting in Taxonomyeligible EL CapEx of . prior year .. The significant decline in CapEx is related to less additions to property plant and equipment as well as to rightofuse assets.For our leased buildings we calculated an OpEx of .m EUR for the financial year prior year .m EUR related to maintenance and repair as well as the daytoday servicing of these assets. Total OpEx for amounts to .m EUR prior year .m EUR and relates to noncapitalised development costs costs for short term leasing costs for maintenance and repair as well as costs for daytoday servicing of assets.,,,,0.353356062838296,,0.4394482260846051,,0.36286137580942024,0.34793420569605366,,,0.41991922886681576,,0.3971350142532667,,,,,0.35052640713887634
796,Apart from economic activity . we did not identify any other material CapEx OpEx or Taxonomyrelated turnover. For this evaluation we used a materiality threshold of . on CapEx OpEx and turnover. We only report an eligible activity if it meets at least one of the thresholds. However total CapEx OpEx and turnover are calculated without applying a materiality threshold. Hence turnover disclosed for Taxonomynoneligible activities is the total revenue of the group for the financial year according to IAS .a in the amount of .m EUR prior year .m EUR as disclosed in our consolidated financial statements for and further described under .. . Revenue in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. We have allocated all of the calculated Taxonomyeligible CapEx and OpEx to the environmental objective of climate change mitigation. In addition only one economic activity was identified for which Taxonomyeligible CapEx and OpEx were calculated. This avoided any double counting.Furthermore we assessed the proportion of our CapEx that qualifies as environmentally sustainable and is therefore reported as CapEx related to Taxonomyaligned economic activities. This assessment was based on the criteria laid down in Article of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. Because our CapEx is only related to the purchase of output we connected with the owners of the respective facilities to collect the relevant information. The information obtained relating to the technical screening criteria including both the substantial contribution and the DNSH principles was insufficient to perform the assessment. As a result we were not able to qualify our Taxonomyeligible CapEx related to the leasing of buildings as Taxonomyaligned CapEx for the financial year. This correspondingly also applies to related OpEx. Furthermore since we did not identify any Taxonomyeligible turnover we could not calculate any Taxonomyaligned turnover. ,0.3581753175074662,0.34777587656657777,0.4662271829341089,0.33423941374680266,0.45332123254353834,0.36731551288822534,,,,,,,,0.3901815051026453,0.3346426427793983,,,,

820,Enhancing sustainable and more climateresilient practices We aim to enhance the resilience of our infrastructure and value chain by collaborating with suppliers to address climate risks ensure continuity and promote sustainable practices and technologies and by integrating climate adaptation into our strategic planning and decisionmaking processes.Across our climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts we are committed to enabling sustainable practices within our own operations and value chain. This involves sourcing materials responsibly reducing waste promoting circular economy principles and working with suppliers and partners to encourage sustainable practices throughout the value chain. We engage with stakeholders including employees customers and suppliers to build awareness and collaborate on climate change mitigation and adaptation initiatives.The policy objectives and management principles guide our engagement with employees and partners on sustainability and climate change. We continuously engage employees and partners through internal enablement trainings to increase awareness and responsibility within Zalando to support fashion that is produced consumed and sold in a more responsible manner. We are dedicated to working with suppliers who share our commitment to sustainability. We will continue to engage with our suppliers to promote and support the adoption of less carbon intensive practices including reducing GHG emissions reducing resource use setting SBTs and minimising waste. We prioritise the sourcing of materials and products that decrease our environmental impact. This includes selecting more sustainably sourced raw materials as aligned with our circularity policy. For further information on our approach to alternative materials and sourcing please refer to the section ESRS E Resource use and circular economy.Actions and resources related to climate change policiesOur climate change policy aims at decarbonising our own operations scope and and value chain scope emissions in line with our SBTs. The actions listed below showcase our main initiatives to support the policy objectives of energy efficiency and the transition to renewable energy sources as well as the decarbonisation of our value chain. The GHG emission reductions from our efforts relating to decarbonising our own operations and the value chain are reported under the section Gross scopes and total GHG emissions. The expected GHG emission reductions of our actions are described in the section Targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation. We acknowledge that our ability to implement actions related to climate change is dependent on the availability and effective allocation of financial ,,,0.3817462325808332,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
821,technological and human resources. Investments in renewable energy energy and resource efficiency measures and sustainable infrastructure are central to our climate strategy. These investments rely on securing adequate funding and alignment with operational priorities. The actions listed in the climate change water resource use and circular economy sections also address some of the identified physical and transition climaterelated risks such as operational and logistics disruptions alternative materials sourcing and energy market volatility. We plan to continue assessing these risks as part of our overall risk management process and transition planning in alignment with our netzero ambition.. Decarbonisation of our own operationsIn scope and scope contributed less than . of our total GHG emissions. GHG emissions in these categories are primarily driven by heating in the offices outlets and logistic centres that are fully operated by us. Our main actions to decarbonise our operations and achieve our SBTs are described below. Six logistics centres included within the ESRS E scope financial plus operational control are excluded from our GHGP scope regarding the decarbonisation actions due to a lack of operational control. For further information on our ESRS E scope and GHGP scope please refer to Methodology used for target setting in the section Targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation.,,0.3297159944511175,0.37951705638069705,0.4103938360989177,0.40666124249751673,,,0.370757602981403,,,,,,,,,,,
822,Heating Most heatingrelated emissions are generated from within our logistics network. While some sites are already fully electrified we continued in to work towards electrifying additional sites through the replacement of gas boilers with heat pumps in the office areas of three of our fulfilment centres in Poland finalising the construction project at the end of . The impact on our own operations was accounted for in the GHG inventory and will continue to be accounted for in the following periods. ,,0.31057092163987665,0.3922207798671637,0.46275816938760994,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
823,Electricity Switching to renewables is an important practice that is related to reducing overall electricity and energy consumption. We have been procuring . of our electricity from renewable sources since and are a member of the RE initiative. This includes continuing to generate electricity from photovoltaic panels at our fulfilment centres in Lahr Rotterdam and Verona. Purchasing renewable electricity is an ambition we strive to maintain year after year and is a pillar of our scope and decarbonisation strategy for the foreseeable future.,,,,0.3795397740180961,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Decarbonisation of value chain packaging and lastmile delivery In we engaged with our packaging and lastmile delivery partners to support them in setting their own emissions reduction targets in line with the SBTi criteria. This initiative will contribute to our target suppliers SBT setting as well as to our netzero ambition further described under the section Targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Partners that contribute significantly to our corporate carbon footprint have been a particular focus of negotiations. In addition SBTs have already been introduced as a hard ,,,,,,,,0.39568971666351804,,,,,,,,,,,
847,Methodology used for target setting Our shortterm emissions reduction targets were developed in accordance with the SBTi targetsetting framework. Our targets encompass scope and emissions with scope and marketbased scope targets based on the SBTis absolute contraction methodology. With reference to the GHGP and SBTi requirements the targets were derived from a GHG emissions baseline inventory developed around the time of SBTs submission that follows the operational control approach GHGP scope as opposed to the financial control plus operational control approach required by ESRS E ESRS E scope. Under ESRS E scope and GHG emissions shall first include the emissions of the consolidated accounting group of Zalando financial control and additionally account for the emissions of business partners over which Zalando has operational control. Operational control is defined in Annex of the Delegated Act as the situation where the undertaking has the ability to direct the operational activities and relationships of the entity site operation or asset. Six logistic centres which are part of the consolidated accounting group of Zalando i.e. scope and under ESRS E are accounted for in our GHGP scope within scope category upstream transportation and distribution. Thus our shortterm emissions reduction targets scope and portion covers . when considering locationbased emissions . when considering marketbased emissions of the financial year GHG emissions inventory ESRS E scope disclosed under E. Additionally Zalando includes in scope category purchased goods and services emissions associated with goods sold by Zalando partner business. These emissions have been integrated into our baseline GHG inventory and SBTs i.e. included in our GHGP scope. In the ESRS E scope only the portions of these emissions that need to be disclosed in scope categories and according to the ESRS E requirements should be considered. Please refer to the table E GHG emissions for an overview of both GHG inventories.The development and approval of these targets involved extensive engagement with internal stakeholders during and prior to submission to the SBTi. Both our annual GHG inventory and progress towards our public climate targets are disclosed annually including through the Carbon Disclosure Project CDP. To ensure our targets were representative the baseline year of for Zalandos scope and targets was selected based on the most recent GHG inventory available during the targetsetting process reflecting Zalandos average performance. The methodologies and frameworks used in setting our SBTs are based on foundational inputs from the IPCC and International Energy Agency pathways for corporate decarbonisation. In the absence of sectorspecific pathways the global crosssector pathway of the SBTi was used as a basis. Through the SBTi validation process SBTi assessed that our scope and targets are aligned with .C IPCC decarbonisation pathways. The SBTi is an organisation that helps companies to set sciencebased climate targets. The targets of the SBTi are widely accepted and are considered to be sciencebased. The methodology of the SBTi is subject to inherent uncertainties regarding the underlying scientific findings and forwardlooking assumptions about the reduction of GHG emissions necessary to achieve the .C reduction pathway. Updated scientific findings on the course of climate change could lead to a change in the SBTi methodology and the assessment of whether the ambition level of the targets is sufficient to limit global warming to .C.,,,,0.325481358590507,,,0.4181766088062366,,,,,,,,,,,,

857,equivalent emissions factors when available within our GHG inventory in order to account for the Kyoto Protocol GHGs. Our scope emissions accounted for . and scope and emissions accounted for . of our total GHGs.Scope emissions are calculated as the sum of emissions from mobile fuel combustion in our company vehicles stationary fuel combustion of natural gas and burning oil for heat in our fulfilment centres and office buildings and refrigerant losses in our fulfilment centres and office buildings.For scope emissions both marketbased and locationbased scope emissions are calculated Zalando uses marketbased scope emissions in its official GHG inventory. Zalando procures most of its electricity through green tariffs contracts. Only for less than of electricity consumption the purchase of unbundled certificates is performed within two months after the reporting period ends. District heating is consumed in some office buildings and this consumption is multiplied by district heating emission factors and supplierspecific factors where available. Locationbased scope emissions are calculated by multiplying electricity consumption with countryspecific electricity grid emission factors and district heating consumption with district heating grid emission factors where available.For scope and scope emissions we disclose emissions for the consolidated Zalando group. We did not identify any facilities or assets under our operational control that are not already fully consolidated in our financial statements.For scope emissions a range of methodologies assumptions and emission factors are used to calculate the individual scope categories. Less than of scope emissions are calculated using primary data. The most significant scope category for us is category purchased goods and services.

922,Chemical pollution processes such as bleaching printing and finishing often involve harmful chemicals that if not properly managed can be released into the environment.The material environmental impacts resulting from the DMA occur during the production and distribution stages including raw material extraction textile production and transportation. These stages are outside our direct operations. Within our own operations emissions are comparatively nonsignificant. For example noncarbon emissions to air of our fulfilment centres are significantly lower than the emissions generated by the manufacturing processes. Similarly microplastics potentially generated from our operations if present are minimal compared to the microplastics generated during the use phase of a fashion product over its life span. We did not screen site locations for pollutionrelated IROs as none of the sites under our operation and control have emission sources that require reporting according to Regulation EC No of the European Parliament and of the Council European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register EPRTR Regulation. Affected communities along the value chain were not directly consulted during the DMA. For further information on stakeholder engagement in our DMA please refer to Impacts risks and opportunities in section .. General information. For these reasons our disclosures on pollution focus on our policies and actions related to chemical management. Accordingly we have not yet established any groupwide policies actions or targets in relation to pollution of air water soil and microplastics in line with the ESRS. Reporting on pollution metrics disclosure requirements ESRS E and E for our own operations is not included as it is considered not material to Zalando according to our DMA.Policies related to pollutionTo manage upstream and downstream impacts and comply with regulations we have developed a chemical management system. This includes the Restricted Substances List RSL to determine chemical requirements and limits for harmful substances in products. For private labels the Manufacturing Restricted Substances List MRSL restricts chemicals in production aligned with Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals standards.

925,Identification and assessment of material waterrelated IROsOur business depends on continued access to water and we are already witnessing the effects of water scarcity and water quality risks in our activities. Previously assessed climaterelated risks and opportunities described in the Resilience analysis and climate scenario planning in section ESRS E Climate change have informed our DMA. Our climate resilience analysis contributes to identifying waterrelated risks linked to the increasing occurrence of extreme weather events such as flooding or droughts along our value chain and in our own operations. Key risks carried into our DMA include reputational risks from water consumption in our value chain business continuity risks from water scarcity affecting raw material availability and human health impacts from reduced water security. Opportunities centre on the potential to enable collective action on water stewardship. No IROs related to marine resources were identified as our business does not rely on marine resources. We have not screened our assets and activities to identify the IROs. However in we undertook an assessment of water risk areas related to our own operations. This assessment specifically focuses on our direct impact on water consumption in these water risk regions with further details provided in the following section. In we conducted a water risk assessment for our private labels for major Tier wet processing facilities and going forward we aim to pay particular attention to our private labels water impact particularly in high water stress areas. Direct consultations with affected communities have not been conducted.Policies related to waterWe established our water management policy in reflecting our ambition to addressing the critical water challenges associated with our own operations and value chain. This policy sets the foundation for managing water consumption and pollution and for managing waterrelated risks. We are dedicated to continuously expanding and refining our water management approach in the future in alignment with industry best practices and stakeholder expectations. Water management is critical for the resilience of our business operations and value chain. The aim of our water management policy is to minimise our water consumption and water pollution comply with regulatory requirements and ensure the responsible use of water resources across our own operations and value chain.,,0.3131993371026963,,,0.4762599987104165,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The coCEO is the highest decisionmaking body for waterrelated issues. Our water management policy and initiatives the water risk assessment for our own operations and the water footprint calculation align with the principles of both the Alliance for Water Stewardship Standard and the CEO Water Mandate in terms of identifying water stress and waterrelated risks. We plan further alignment with these and other related principles and objectives of internationally recognised standards for water management to guide our efforts in sustainable water use pollution control and watershed protection. Our current focus is on understanding and assessing our impact in areas of high water consumption and stress. This will inform future policies that address high water stress areas.,,,,,0.4690109107773073,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
935,Actions and resources related to water managementOur key action is the factory improvement programme the initiative to engage factories in our private labels value chain to address their carbon and water impacts. Participating factories develop and sign off on action plans to improve their water and energy management. For further information on the initiative please refer to Actions and resources related to climate change policies in section ESRS E Climate change.Targets related to water managementWe are currently in the exploratory phase and have not yet set specific water targets in line with the ESRS. We are considering water quality quantity and risk and stress levers. The monitoring of water consumption will be used to track the effectiveness of our water management policy related to water quantity for our own operations. As the policy emphasises efficient water use tracking consumption will allow us to measure progress towards our objectives. The year will act as the baseline for future evaluations providing a reference point for our ongoing improvement efforts.Metrics for our water consumptionIn we focused on establishing our corporate water footprint and water risk assessment starting with our own operations water metrics calculation.,,0.3624062930551407,0.38638296571630054,0.3724725158723821,0.5465732280323395,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

947, at facilities in our own operations.Total water consumption in areas at water risk To identify areas of high water risk we employ a composite index approach that aggregates multiple waterrelated risks i.e. physical risk quantity physical risk quality and regulatory and reputational risks allowing for a comprehensive risk assessment. The calculation is performed on via the World Resources Institute Aqueduct tool which returns values for the total water risk on a scale from low risk to extremely high risk. The assessment covered logistics and nonlogistics sites. Among all Zalando sites only our fulfilment centre in Lodz Poland is classified as in an area at high overall water risk. Water consumption in areas at water risk is calculated as the sum of all water consumption at facilities that are located in areas of high and extremely high overall water risk scores from to .

955,Identification and assessment of material resource use and circular economyrelated IROsTo identify the environmental impact potential related to the circular economy we conducted life cycle assessments LCAs in and updated them in during the DMA. They encompassed different circular business models such as preowned takeback care and repair and reusable packaging. The LCA results highlighted that raw material extraction and processing were the most significant environmental impact areas of a products life cycle. These outcomes informed our DMA completed in and our new circularity policy. Regarding the use of materials we depend heavily on cotton polyester and leather as key materials for the majority of products offered by our private label business and brand partners. By embedding more sustainable practices across our value chain from product sourcing and design to logistics and recommerce we ensure that we remain resilient in the face of emerging environmental challenges while contributing to the creation of longterm value for our stakeholders. We have outlined the specific business units responsible for managing IROs related to our resource use and circular economy initiatives below.The SDI team includes resources dedicated to the oversight of the comprehensive assessment of IROs related to resource use and the circular economy. This team sets our strategic direction for transitioning to a circular economy by developing strategic initiatives and partnerships that accelerate circular innovation.Policies related to resource use and circular economyOur circularity policy provides an overarching strategic framework for driving progress in the circular economy to manage our material IROs. The policy focuses on three foundational pillars i Circular products ii Circular business models and iii Endoflife broadly covering our business activities. We are committed to fostering innovation by continuing our efforts to support and scale up initiatives building on strategic investments in textiletotextile recyclers to date.

958, Additionally in October we eliminated the use of void fill from the shipments going out from our fulfilment centres excluding Lounge by Zalando. Before boxes were filled with void fill plastic matter to transport the products in a stable and protected manner.In May we launched a new shipping bag specification and tender which redesigned our entire packaging portfolio. This included the development of a comprehensive specification document that aimed to achieve a full rollout of paper shipping bags while eliminating plastic shipping bags. The transition was completed in March and the initiative has contributed to the significant reduction of singleuse plastics across our portfolio.Contract adjustmentsIn all contractual negotiations with our packaging suppliers we have established the following mandatory actions,,,,,,,,0.3763486389035683,,,,,,,,,,,
961,Mechanical recyclability documentation Upon written request suppliers shall provide documentation on mechanical recyclability of products e.g. ISO certification as proof of selfdeclared recyclable claim.These stringent requirements have been introduced to new and renewed contracts with packaging suppliers starting in . By integrating these sustainability requirements into our contractual agreements we aim to gain comprehensive insights into the environmental impacts of each of our packaging products facilitating informed decisionmaking and identifying areas for improvement. We also aim to ensure that the materials used in packaging ,,,0.49631671060978494,,,,0.4143546944454922,,,,,,,,,,,,
963,come from responsibly managed forests supporting our circularity policy by reducing waste and enhancing material reuse.Reusable intralogistics boxesWe have implemented a reusable system for intralogistics boxes specifically for medium and large cardboard boxes which serve as tertiary packaging to move items between all our logistics sites including fulfilment centres for Lounge by Zalando and return centres. Launched in this process was applied to our mediumsized boxes covering some fulfilment centres for Lounge by Zalando and return centres avoiding the use of metric tons of new boxes in that year. In by expanding the use of reusable cardboard boxes to more fulfilment and return centres we avoided the use of metric tons of packaging material.,,,,,,,,0.38404745633975723,,,,,,,,,,,
964, In we continued the expansion of reusable cardboard boxes to additional fulfilment and return centres across our network resulting in metric tons of packaging avoided. This expansion included standardising operational processes and reallocating reused boxes. We also initiated the development of a reusable concept for our large intralogistics boxes.The project aims for continuous expansion until a fully closedloop system for all intralogistics boxes has been achieved. The full implementation is expected to be completed by in fulfilment and return centres with plans for future expansion.Recommerce In recommerce we offer customers the opportunity to extend the life of fashion items through Tradein and Preowned. We launched our Tradein service in September . Using Tradein today customers in five markets AT DE DK NL SE can sell back items previously purchased on Zalando across women men and unisex in textile sports footwear and bags. All items sent in by customers are individually assessed by an expert team in our logistics centre to ensure authenticity and sufficient item quality for resale. A payout is awarded for each item which passes our quality check either in the form of a Zalando gift card which may be redeemed on all items in our app and web store including Preowned or in the form of an equivalentvalue donation to a charitable cause Red Cross humedica WeForest with customers offered a choice between the two options.Through Preowned also launched in September on Zalando and now live in markets as an ongoing initiative we offer those items sold back to us through Tradein in a dedicated catalogue enabling second hand shopping on Zalando. Orders are fulfilled from a Zalando logistics outbound centre combining new and second hand items in one box where possible. We track progress via the number of markets in which recommerce is live. Market scope is differentiated by i the number of markets in which customers can sell back to us Tradein in live in AT DE DK NL SE and ii the number of markets in which customers can purchase second hand clothing Preowned in live in markets AT BE CZ DE DK ,,,,,,,0.44735864667960384,,,,,,,,,,,,
969,Increased use of responsibly sourced materials in our products including Leather Working Groupcertified leather FSCcertified or Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification PEFC MMCF materials and animal fibres certified by the Responsible Wool Standard or Responsible Mohair Standard. Additionally we are incorporating materials produced using lower environmental impact and processing techniques.Information on the targets for the materials used for private labels is described in the section below.Targets related to resource use and circular economyIn we evaluated the material choices for our private labels using tools such as LCA and the netzero reduction model to identify the most impactful raw materials. The assessment identified cotton and polyester as the most impactful materials in terms of both environmental impact and having the biggest volume share of the private labels material portfolio. Therefore we prioritised setting targets for cotton and polyester for our private label business as well as packaging paper focusing on the resource inflows associated with these materials. At present we have not adopted specific targets for resource outflows and waste in line with the ESRS.Private labels target Following LCA findings and our circular economy and sustainable sourcing policies to reduce reliance on virgin materials we have committed to fully phase out virgin polyester and conventional cotton for our private labels by tons compared to a baseline of tons. We will source preferred material options including recycled for polyester and organic regenerative and recycled for cotton among others.The target applies to the total weight of polyester and cotton used across all private label products. The target will enable us to achieve impact at scale and aligns with the broader climate and resource efficiency goals and our netzero ambition. Focusing on these materials ,,,0.42477245990388024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
970,enables us to drive direct positive impact through our private labels while the findings from the LCA provide scientific evidence that guided our targetsetting process.The Private Label team developed the targets in consultation with the private labels Commercial teams as well as the SDI team. The targets have been approved by the VP Private Label and Product Supply.Packaging target We aim to source . recycled or FSCcertified paper packaging on an annual basis.We have committed to sourcing . of our packaging from recycled or sustainable sources FSC or Blauer Engel certified sources aligned with our circular economy and sustainable sourcing policy objectives of transitioning away from virgin resources. This target covers all packaging procured by us for final products measured by total weight. The scope includes both our own operations and upstream sourcing with a global reach. The target has an annual timeframe for completion meaning that the baseline year coincides with the target year . The target will be reviewed annually taking into account changes in active suppliers and the products procured each year.We base our calculations on the specifications of the primary material which accounts for more than of the products total weight. If the primary material is FSCcertified we consider the entire weight of that material to be sustainably sourced. For recycled content only the percentage of recycled material within the primary component is counted as sustainably sourced. We base this target on scientific evidence using LCAs to quantify packaging impact in supplier contracts. Packaging weight is tracked via our SAP system and FSC certificates are provided at a supplier level. By . of our packaging came from sustainable sources or from recycled content we will work together with our suppliers to collect the proper documentation that validates the sourcing of the rest of the materials.To set our packaging target we engage with key internal and external stakeholders including senior management suppliers and environmental organisations to align with industry best practices. As part of the Canopy PackGood initiative we collaborated with Canopy to adopt sustainable sourcing goals resulting in our target to use . recycled or FSCcertified paper packaging.Resource inflowsAt Zalando resource inflows include all products and materials that enter our facilities including packaging. This encompasses items from various businesses Our BC segment Fashion including retail and partner business as well as all product categories such as private labels Lounge by Zalando Zalando Outlets and recommerce in addition to our BB segment with ZEOS Fulfilment including ZFS and our multichannel fulfilment offering. Whilst packaging within recommerce is included in the scope of resource inflow calculations the data related to recommerce products is excluded from the calculations as this information has already been accounted for during the products first life cycle.,,,0.3730906240139829,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
971,All product categories such as fashion footwear accessories and electronics are reported in aggregate form. The resource inflow metrics refer to all products and materials used for the production of products and packaging. The reported data reflects the materials in their original state including product and packaging weight and material composition as they enter our facilities. The resource inflow metrics were calculated using all available article and packaging data including weight material composition and sustainably sourced and recycled materials data. This includes materials adhering to thirdparty certifications or licensed or trademarked standards such as the Global Recycle Standard and the Global Organic Textile Standard. Packaging material is considered sustainably sourced if it meets one of the following conditions i the supplier provides material that is specifically FSCcertified ii the supplier holds an FSC certificate for their company and Zalando includes a contractual requirement that all materials delivered must be FSCcertified or iii the packaging is labelled as FSC MIX or FSC RECYCLED confirming compliance with FSC sustainability standards. Sustainably sourced and recycled material data undergo automated validation processes to ensure accuracy and applicability. Additionally a binary classification system is applied to distinguish between technical and biological materials. Data duplication is prevented via various mechanisms including i building distinct article provision into the calculation methodology ii ensuring comparability of data across metrics iii comparing of aggregate data results with GHG accounting results and iv testing results for duplication prior to calculation.As a multibrand retail platform Zalandos ability to acquire product sustainabilityrelated data is partly limited. We know that many of our business partners struggle to significantly increase the use of sustainably sourced materials in their own assortments due to technological challenges in innovation and price premiums for many of these materials and customers willingness to pay more for sustainable products. Even when our partners have successfully integrated these materials into their assortments the lack of unified data standards evolving regulatory requirements and difficulty in data sharing processes presents an added challenge to share this information upstream with a multibrand retailer like Zalando. We anticipate that the use of such materials throughout the fashion sector will organically increase in coming years as regulatory ecodesign and reporting requirements continue to expand in Europe. However we aim to continue enabling and encouraging business partners on our platform to adopt sustainablysourced recycled materials and design strategies that support the circular economy through our sustainable sourcing policy and our voluntary sustainabilityrelated claim framework.,,,0.45072333011035143,,,,0.41821924403345656,,,,,,,,,,,,

974,Resource outflowsDurability After conducting an indepth market analysis and a durability maturity assessment we found that no established methodology or industrywide averages exist for our product categories to make comparisons. Therefore durability is excluded from the sustainability statement. Further analysis will be conducted to incorporate any future sectorspecific requirements for reporting. We recognise why such a metric is useful for the industry and especially for customers but this sector already faces a proliferation of tools and methodologies at a time when standardisation is required. Therefore we are dedicated to work on an industry wide solution. Repairability Currently there is no established rating system to evaluate the repairability of fashion products resulting in an inconsistent approach for assessing the feasibility and ease of repair of garments and accessories. We are actively monitoring upcoming regulatory changes including the Right to Repair Directive EU which will take effect in . The regulation is expected to influence how repairability is addressed although it will still vary based on the specific damage and product involved. We expect the sectorspecific ESRS being developed by the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group to provide guidance on how to evaluate the repairability of fashion products.We have developed our first repairability guidelines for our private labels with a focus on promoting design elements and techniques which support product repairability including,,,0.3718042598483288,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

978,Recyclable content in products Current reporting guidelines do not yet define how to assess the recyclable content of fashion products. After thoroughly analysing existing industry standards and regulations related to recyclability and metric methodologies we explored the possibility of establishing an internal metric for product recyclability. However we concluded that the available definitions and methodologies do not meet the qualitative characteristics QC of information required by ESRS . Specifically we are unable to ensure faithful representation QCQC or provide comparable data over time QCQC. CSRD aims to standardise sustainability reporting across companies with sectorspecific standards expected to result in reliable and comparable information. In line with this objective we have excluded the recyclability of products from the sustainability statement as we believe current methodologies would not deliver the level of transparency and consistency required.Recyclable content in product packaging Our current methodology considers product packaging recyclable if the material making up of the product packaging meets specific criteria for recycling processes. According to the minimum standard defined by the Central Agency Packaging Register Zentrale Stelle Verpackungsregister mechanically recyclable means that the packaging can be sorted and processed using available industrial recycling technologies to produce highquality recyclates. This involves assessing the material composition of the packaging the presence of appropriate sorting and recycling infrastructure and ensuring the packaging can substitute virgin material in typical applications after recycling. We consider a material as recyclable when we have self declarations from suppliers or when the specifications of the material indicate that it is paper paperboard or cardboard and aligns with the definition of fibrous material in the standard mentioned above.The rate of recyclable content in products packaging in is ..Waste In the fashion ecommerce sector waste generation primarily comes from two sources packaging and textile waste. At Zalando we are committed to reducing our environmental impact by addressing both of these areas,,,0.5083284029034502,,,,0.43288105902863944,,,,,,,,,,,,
979,Packaging The majority of our waste is packagingrelated driven by customers returns as well as internal logistics processes. Our approach focuses on reducing excess packaging through optimised design and reusing boxes within intralogistics operations thus minimising the need for new packaging materials. Our packaging generated waste consists of paper and cardboard . of our total generated waste plastic . wooden . and mixed packaging ..,,,0.4547081949206866,,0.4276812609623804,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
980,Textiles Our multichannel sales strategy contributes positively to waste minimisation by optimising inventory management. Unsold inventory is offloaded across various platforms including Lounge by Zalando and outlet stores. In addition we take the opportunity to donate remaining stock to organisations such as humedica or sell it to retail partners ensuring no goods are destroyed except for health hygiene or safety reasons. In order to fully comply with our duty of care we only work with selected aid organisations and retail partners whose headquarters are located within the EU and who are therefore also bound by applicable laws.

999,To address these potential negative impacts we have implemented comprehensive processes policies and targets to mitigate risks and promote positive outcomes. We identified material positive impacts on our workforce in the area of training and skills development.The following risks and opportunities stem from impacts and dependencies on our workforce risks related to violence and harassment within the organisation risks related to workers rights including collective bargaining the risk of insufficient worklife balance the risks of lack of DI within the organisation and in hiring and support structures which could lead to legal and reputational liabilities as well as insufficient prevention measures especially for employees in fulfilment centres e.g. the qualification and training of employees. Please also refer to Impacts risks and opportunities in section .. General information for a comprehensive list.We aim to adhere strictly to laws and regulations pertaining to human rights as well as the prohibition of forced and child labour. We have not identified any risks related to human rights violations. This matter is treated with the utmost seriousness and we are committed to ensuring that no violations of human rights occur within our workforce.There are no indications of significant effects on our employees resulting from our planned transition actions aimed at mitigating environmental impacts and achieving ecofriendly and climateneutral operations. We are currently actively developing a climate transition action plan and are committed to disclosing and implementing it within the next two years.All metrics for our employees are reported in terms of headcount individuals who are in an employment relationship with Zalando according to national law or practice at the end of the financial year i.e. December unless otherwise stated. The prioryear data for presented in this section is unaudited. Parttime work is expressed as a percentage of weekly working hours.

1011,Policies and practices related to own workforceRegarding the integration of the following policies into our operational activities in accordance with our strategy and commitment to our employees final accountability lies with our CPO. Our internal Zalando employee portal provides employees with a comprehensive repository of all our policies.Freedom of association At Zalando we are committed to upholding the rights of our employees to freely associate establish works councils and join unions in compliance with the legal frameworks applicable in each of our operating countries across Europe. As a European company with the majority of our employees based in Germany we recognise the diversity of labour practices across the EU and ensure that our policies align with both national and EUwide standards on workers rights.In Germany the right to freedom of association is enshrined in the German Constitution Grundgesetz under Article . Furthermore representation through works councils is highly regulated by the German Works Constitution Act Betriebsverfassungsgesetz. These legal foundations ensure that our employees have the right and the means to organise and represent themselves and participate in decisionmaking processes within Zalando.The voluntary Zalando Employee Participation ZEP programme provides an additional platform for those employees not represented by a works council enabling them to engage directly with management and contribute to company decisions. The Strategic Employee Relations team transparently supports employees who wish to establish an informal ZEP a works council or who have questions regarding unions and their rights. They work closely with the employees on a daily basis ensuring that employee participation and codetermination are central to our operations. We have defined own regulations and these have been agreed to by the management board.We are supported by works councils across various locations in Germany. These works councils which are created elected and composed of by our employees play a critical role in our decisionmaking processes particularly on matters that directly impact employees thus enabling employee participation and codetermination to remain central to our operations.On a groupwide level and particularly for crossborder matters employee representation is further strengthened through our European Works Council EWC formerly International Employee Board which operates under the Act on the Participation of Employees in a European Company SEBeteiligungsgesetz SEBG. This body ensures that employee perspectives from all our operating countries are considered in our European and global strategies. Furthermore the employee representatives ensure employee participation at the supervisory board level.In the following table we present the percentage of total employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. Where there are one or more collective bargaining agreements in the European Economic Area EEA we present the overall percentage of employees covered by such agreements for each country in which there is significant employment defined as at least employees by headcount representing at least of the total number and the ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.34702340880126625,,0.2586792790181389,,
1015,Less than of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.Secure employment We aim to fully comply with the local legislation relevant to secure employment in the countries in which we operate. We take two approaches to ensuring secure employment differentiating between overhead functions embodied by approximately half of our employees and nonoverhead functions primarily logistics and customerfacing functions embodied by the remaining employees. In general for overhead employees we offer an unlimited contract with six months probation for both parties employee and Zalando to reach a longterm commitment agreement. In limited cases and certain instances such as parental coverage andor workload peaks contracts are limited in time. For nonoverhead customer care positions employees initially begin on a temporary contract directly with Zalando which can then be extended to a permanent contract after a successful oneyear term.In our logistics centres and outlets employees typically start on a temporary contract through an external agency for approximately six months. Following a positive performance evaluation and suitable business conditions employees may transition to a direct limitedterm contract with Zalando. After completing four limited contracts or working for two years employees in these roles become eligible for a permanent contract.Social protection In accordance with German law all our employees based in Germany working a fiveday week are entitled to a minimum of vacation days annually. However we go beyond this legal requirement offering employees to vacation days depending on their role and tenure within Zalando. For employees based outside of Germany we ensure full compliance with the respective local labour laws offering vacation days and social benefits that align with or exceed national requirements. In addition Zalando employees are entitled to special leave in the event of major life events such as the death of a close relative relocation marriage or becoming a parent as well as special leave or time off for caretaking needs of relatives.,,,,,,,,,0.3437317369308838,,,,,,,,,,
1016,Our employees are covered by comprehensive social protection aligned with local labour laws which requires that both employees and employers contribute to public funds for unemployment insurance sickness benefits work injury compensation disability support parental leave and retirement.Worklife balance To facilitate a smooth return to work we offer job security childcare support and returntowork programmes. Berlinbased employees have access to approximately kindergarten places through partnerships with daycare providers and our oncampus daycare centre. Additionally all our employees have access to the worklife balance service provided by the Fürstenberg Institute offering up to five days of emergency childcare annually. This support proves invaluable in situations like the recent kindergarten strike in Berlin ensuring employees can manage unforeseen challenges while maintaining a worklife balance.The percentage of employees entitled to take familyrelated leave is .. Furthermore the following table shows the percentage of employees that took familyrelated leave by gender. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3493772217325038,,
1019,Our approach to worklife balance is similar to the secure employment approach differentiating between overhead and nonoverhead functions. Our policies for overhead employees in this area are shaped by a commitment to fostering a culture of trust and flexibility. This approach empowers employees to take ownership of their tasks responsibilities and working hours promoting greater autonomy with the goal of improving both job satisfaction and productivity. Simultaneously we strictly adhere to legal working hour regulations such as the Hours of Work Act Arbeitszeitgesetz ArbZG ensuring that all employees work within the statutory limits. Our nonoverhead employees in logistic centres outlet stores and customer care have flexible shift patterns that accommodate diverse needs. In our logistic centres teams work across early late and night shifts with schedules normally provided several weeks in advance to allow for adequate rest. We offer parental shifts and flexible arrangements to support the worklife balance.We maintain strict guidelines for special workingtime requirements such as oncall duties and weekend work. These regulations subject to approval by works councils and local authorities prioritise employee wellbeing and prevent overtime. We offer specific compensation for oncall duties ensuring fair treatment for employees. Our annual assessment and improvement of Cyber Week planning demonstrates our commitment to balancing employee needs with business demands.,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3819878012222579,,,,0.3108271763559253,,
1020,Mobile work agreement In we introduced a mobile work agreement allowing overhead employees to work remotely for up to of their time depending on their role and internal team guidelines. This agreement was developed collaboratively between the works councils Strategic Employee Relations team and the PO Executive Leadership team. Additionally employees with disabilities are offered enhanced flexibility with the option to work from home up to five days per week depending on the nature of their role.Health and safety The health and safety of employees is critical to our success and we are committed to providing safe and healthy work environments in every possible instance recognising our special responsibility to ensure these qualities in our own logistic centres as highlighted by the results of our DMA.The health safety security and environment policy applicable to our Zalando logistics premises complies with the requirements of the EU Directive EEC the International Organization for Standardization and the Transported Asset Protection Association and sets out a general approach to health and safety security and environment in order to protect people suppliers and business partners as well as to prevent accidents to the same. The policy was authorised by the Director of Warehouse Operation and Director of Logistics Warehouses with consultation from the Legal Compliance and Governance and Risk teams. The policy is made available to all employees during their onboarding sessions and an annual training on health and safety is provided.The following table presents the health and safety management system information for our employees.

1028,Adequate wages For our metrics on adequate wages in accordance with the Eurostat database countries within the EEA are used as an applicable benchmark. For countries outside the EEA any benchmark that meets the criteria set out by the Sustainable Trade Initiative may be used including applicable benchmarks aligned with the Anker Methodology or provided by the Wage Indicator Foundation or Fair Wage Network. For these countries there are different adequate wage benchmark figures for different subnational regions the U.S Bureau of Labour Statistics Chinas average yearly wages and Hong Kongs average monthly wages. Interns and working students are excluded from these calculations. None of our employees are paid below adequate wages.Employment and inclusion of persons with disabilities We aim to create an inclusive workplace for employees with disabilities regardless of their official status. To improve Disability inclusion we implemented an action plan in for our Berlinbased offices and employees. Key initiatives include accessibility audits and improvements to physical spaces particularly in our newly constructed Berlin office Allyship programmes leadership awareness measures and inclusive recruitment processes.The Disability inclusion toolkit focuses on the disability legal framework in Germany and empowers leaders and PO business partners to create inclusive environments. Additionally our Employee Assistance Programme EAP provides specialised support for employees navigating disabilityrelated processes like applying for an official German disability pass.Diversity elimination of discrimination We have a clear policy against discrimination documented in our Code of Ethics as described in ESRS G Business conduct in section ..

1034,The complaints we received from our employees in financial year mainly related to potential unequal treatment and work culture. During the reporting period we identified and addressed no cases of severe human rights incidents related to our employees. Accordingly there have been no incidents that may constitute a violation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights the International Labour Organization ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work or the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. We have implemented policies and procedures to prevent such incidents. Training and skills development We offer an annual training budget to support individual development for our employees with the exception of temporary workers e.g. working students or interns. This budget may be used either on our learning internal catalogue or for external resources in cases where the development requirements are not offered internally. This approach was created by our Learning and Development team and approved by the PO Executive Leadership team.In accordance with German educational holiday regulations Bildungsurlaub our education time policy allows employees in Germany to pursue personal and professional development through continuous learning. Depending on the federal state employees may be entitled to up to five days of paid educational leave per year to attend training courses or seminars related to their work or personal interests.Culture Our founding mindset principles are encapsulated in four core values customer focus entrepreneurial thinking speed and team spirit. These principles guide decisionmaking and empower our employees to work in the interest of our customers and partners. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3580942277037434,,,0.3271936587948516,,,
1035,Our management board worked closely with a broad group of leaders to define these principles that are applicable at all levels at Zalando.Prevention of child and forced labour We aim to adhere strictly to laws and regulations pertaining to human rights. In this context thepolicy statement on Zalandos human rights strategy described in section ESRS S Workers in the value chain is also relevant for our own workforce. Furthermore our Code of Ethics outlines the fundamental values of honesty respect trust and fairness and sets clear expectations for the professional ethical and responsible behaviour of all employees. In addition the group policy internal investigation describes the comprehensive management of reported actual or suspected compliance violations. For detailed information please refer to ESRS G Business conduct in section .. Governance information.Processes for engaging with own workforce and Interests and views of stakeholdersWe maintain a robust engagement framework that includes entitywide crossfunctional and business unit meetings at various levels as well as other formats like employee assemblies in codetermined entities. These meetings serve as platforms for sharing updates gathering feedback and fostering a sense of community. Most of the meetings held in hybrid format to ensure accessibility for all employees regardless of location. Zalandowide level meetings are typically hosted by a SVP or one of our management board members.Our quarterly engagement and culture survey is a valuable tool for gathering anonymous feedback on our employee experiences. Covering topics such as belonging fairness support balance leadership and overall sentiment the survey provides both quantitative and qualitative insights. Quantitative metrics like participation engagement and strategic alignment offer valuable data on employee feelings and perceptions. Additionally free text fields allow employees to share detailed feedback on our strengths and areas for improvement. We believe that leaders play a crucial role in cultivating a positive and engaging workplace. Therefore we hold our leaders responsible for the survey results within their respective teams. After analysing the survey data at various levels leaders collaborate with their teams to develop action plans that address areas with critical feedback. To keep improving on DI as a foundation for our longterm success we need to understand and improve on employee inclusion experiences. Following on from our DI survey we therefore launched a second DI survey in for all our employees except due to local data protection regulations those in Italy and China and Highsnobiety employees. We anticipate that the results will empower leaders to develop DI action plans for their business unit. We encourage a transparent open feedback culture between employees peers and leads.Our Strategic Employee Relations team is available to transparently support employees who wish to establish an informal ZEP a works council or who have questions regarding unions and their rights. For more information please refer to Freedom of Association in this chapter. For more information on our human rights strategy that applies to all employees and complements our Code of Ethics please refer to section ESRS S Workers in the value chain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.27847808859341006,,
1036,Processes to raise concerns If an employee experiences inappropriate behaviour feels discriminated against or harassed has a question wishes to discuss a sensitive situation or observes behaviour that is not in line with our Code of Ethics we encourage them to speak up. In some cases the best approach could be to directly approach the involved colleagues. In others employees might speak to their lead or ask a PO business partner for advice. If an employee has experienced or witnessed direct or indirect discrimination harassment or bullying the Corporate Compliance team that handles our groupwide human rights due diligence and the groups Compliance Management System can be contacted to become involved through a protected system. We also offer a whistleblowing tool for all employees. Employees and externals can raise issues through this tool anonymously . Employees may also reach out directly via email or in person to the Corporate Compliance team. Every report is investigated promptly and subject to action where necessary. Employees are provided with additional ways of raising concerns through various feedback sessions surveys works councils and departmentwide meetings. Our Corporate Compliance team has access to the data generated through the whistleblowing tool and analyses the data to better understand where issues originate e.g. business unit nature of the issue or the location among others. Other processes such as the regular anonymous and voluntary DI survey help us gain insight into employees experiences and their perceptions regarding inclusion and belonging. Feedback provided through surveys and feedback sessions and issues raised through our whistleblowing tool are efficiently handled. Our Code of Ethics and Speak Up guidance protects individuals who raise concerns against actions. These are accessible externally on our corporate website and via the internal Zalando employee portal.

ERGs aim to create safer spaces and communities where employees come together to discuss their experiences. Each ERG has dedicated sponsors and robust governance structures. Although these networks are mainly based in Berlin they cooperate with our international sites as well as with Dortmund when necessary. ERGs increase the visibility of underrepresented groups and provide structures to support diversity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.40500197252953385,,,,0.32153238993357564,0.2696162396788328,0.3478445994206434

1063,Material IROs and their interaction with strategy and business model and Interests and views of stakeholdersDecent work is one of two strategic sustainability focus areas in our updated group strategy. Decent work means creating opportunities for productive work in conditions of freedom equity security and human dignity. Focusing on decent work is vital for ensuring the fair treatment of workers in our supply chain. Our decent work focus supports our commitment to respect human rights throughout our operations and supply chain. Although we depend on a complex global supply chain that can pose significant risks to workers we strive to ensure decent work and fair treatment for all individuals involved in bringing our product portfolio to our customers.Our DMA identified potential negative impacts related to forced labour child labour human trafficking inadequate wages and excessive working hours. Denial of freedom of association and collective bargaining agreements pose further risks as does potential discrimination against vulnerable groups including Indigenous peoples minority groups migrant workers sexual minorities and women and children. These risks can stem from insufficient governance and enforcement e.g. of child labour laws in factories and their identification can be complicated due to insufficient and inaccurate worker data. The employment of migrant workers especially those having irregular status further heightens the risk of forced labour while wage noncompliance and a lack of strong regulatory frameworks contribute to significant wage disparities. Notably a lack of occupational health and safety OHS systems threatens worker safety.In addition to our own risk assessments industry reports indicate the following areas of potential concern,,,0.37361724903813376,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.2688236016706631,,

1067,Accessories manufacturing The production of accessories like bags and jewellery in some developing countries may involve risks of child labour in informal workshops.For our private labels being active in the apparel accessories and footwear sector we have identified a significant risk of child labour in India and Bangladesh as well as a significant risk for forced labour in India Bangladesh China and Vietnam. These risks are addressed through our comprehensive due diligence processes. We actively engage with suppliers to ensure compliance with international labour standards and continuously work to improve transparency and ethical practices throughout our value chain.Data on individual groups of workers across our entire value chain is limited as we do not currently have information at that level of detail. Due to the complexity of the fashion supply ,,,0.4115974348744333,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1068,chain to help us carry out due diligence we have so far focused on knowledge gathering via local organisations and multistakeholder initiatives providing us with insights about groups of workers being specifically riskexposed for certain types of legal violations by actions of the industry to help us carry out due diligence. While such assessments lack the connection to individual entities andor workers they are useful in helping us identify material risks. Our ambition is to improve over time our understanding of how workers in our value chain are materially impacted by our business.Our approach to identifying material IROs for workers in our value chain is described in Impacts risks and opportunities in section .. General information. Policies related to workers in the value chainWe respect human rights and uphold responsible labour practices across our entire supply chain as aligned with the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. This is achieved through our policies standards and processes which address impacts potential risks and opportunities forming the basis for sustainability targets and ambitions. We aim to ensure and we expect that our business partners adhere to our policies emphasising labour rights and ethical business practices. Grievance mechanisms for employees and external members of our supply chain are in place to voice concerns and actively promote the awareness of human rights within Zalando and among our partners. In certain areas we maintain the right to conduct audits of our partners processes to review compliance with our ethical standards. When creating our policies we consider our legal obligations established industry standards and the expectations of investors customers and other stakeholders. For transparency relevant policies are publicly available on our corporate website.Code of Conduct We build strong supplier relationships by setting clear high ethical expectations fostering trust and integrity in our collaborations through our Code of Conduct which can be found on our corporate website. This Code outlines the standards to which we hold our business partners accountable and applies to all contractual partners including our suppliers service providers platform partners distributors consultants and agents. It covers human rights labour rights environmental protection fair and ethical business practices and monitoring and complaints. We require all partners to agree with and commit to these standards and have appropriate management systems and due diligence processes in place. Noncompliance will lead to measures being taken which may include termination of the business relationship.Policy statement on Zalandos human rights strategy Our policy statement is basedon international standards including the ILO Conventions and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and sets the groundwork for managing human rights due diligence which is embedded into our operating standards and management practices. The policy applies throughout our entities and for all business activities including facilities operating on behalf of ourselves and is approved by our coCEO Robert Gentz and implemented by the Corporate Governance ,,,0.39275134817984847,,,,0.4586681992843775,,,,,,,,,,,,
1069,team under the responsibility of our SVP Corporate GovernanceGeneral Counsel. Additionally the policy specifies expectations and requirements for all our business partners within the supply chain encompassing suppliers service providers platform partners distributors consultants agents and subcontractors. Our Human Rights Officer monitors the ongoing activities described in the policy and reports to the management board. We continuously evaluate the effectiveness of our approach updating our practices as required. To this end we use the databases in place to document our risk mitigating measures such as audits business partner checks and investigations and their results in order to assess them against their appropriateness for risk mitigation in the concrete area. Such an assessment might then for example trigger additional mitigating measures in specific parts of our supply chain.Child labour prevention and remediation policy In we introduced a strict child labour prevention and remediation policy that complements our Code of Conduct and human rights strategy. This policy aligned with German and international regulations is embedded in the contracts with our private label business partners and outlines expectations for these partners and their subcontractors to prevent identify and remediate child labour issues thus ensuring continuous improvement. Business partners must be committed to eliminating child labour forced labour and other exploitative practices of children and implement written rules control mechanisms and training programmes to prevent such violations. The policy also covers topics such as working hours health and safety measures and access to child care services and education. The implementation of processes described therein is with the responsibility of our Private Label team overseen at the VP level.Modern slavery statement Our modern slavery statement aligned with international frameworks including the relevant ILO Conventions sets out our commitment to preventing modern slavery throughout our business operations and supply chain. Published on our corporate website in accordance with the United Kingdoms Modern Slavery Act the statement details our efforts to prevent and address human rights violations including modern slavery.Workers in the value chain engagement Impacts concerns and remediation channelsOur due diligence programme supports us in preventing identifying managing and remediating potential violations of our standards in our operations supply chain and business partnerships as per due diligence requirements. The programme is implemented through four cyclical steps,,,,,,,0.4315423853665363,,,,,,,,,,0.2716279511595888,,
1070,Analyse The first step in the cycle is an annual review of our direct contractors to determine their exposure to human rights risks categorised as low medium high or very high risk. To a limited extent the analysis also includes environmental risks using a holistic risk assessment methodology for all direct suppliers based on their location industry and the volume of business with them.,,0.32895129321039557,0.40197371673854304,,,0.361076431448249,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1075,standards. If the business partner fails to engage in appropriate remediation measures or if the violation is of such severity that it warrants immediate business consequences we will pause and potentially terminate the business relationship.All information received and retained during the investigations is handled confidentially and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Our policies namely the thirdparty investigation policy and our Code of Conduct explicitly prohibit actions against individuals who raise concerns in good faith.In we opened investigations into potential human rights violations in our supply chain One led to a termination of the business relationship compared to two in a human rights violation in our supply chain could not be proven in eight cases compared to six in and nine other investigations are still ongoing including the case that has already led to the termination of the business relationship as the execution of this decision is still an ongoing process. We place great value on the option of anonymous reporting. Accordingly we are limited in our ability to follow the source of reports we receive leading to limited insights into whether workers in the supply chain make use of our reporting possibilities. Recognising the importance of continuous improvement we assess the effectiveness of our measures throughout our due diligence practices including our grievance and remediation measures using data analysis industry exchange and engagement with expert organisations. Our data analysis involves comparing data points from the risk assessments investigations and remediation yearoveryear as well as reviewing the audit outcome development. We monitor incoming complaints via our reporting channels in quarterly review cycles and present these to the management board and to the audit committee of our supervisory board. In this review incoming complaints are classified according to the legal area of the accusation as well as the severity of the accused constellation amongst others. In this way we are able to identify patterns and trends and react accordingly. For information on how we engage with workers in the value chain by collaborating with external stakeholders and local organisations refer to the following section below on Actions and resources related to workers in the value chain.Actions and resources related to workers in the value chainWe aim to contribute to the creation of decent jobs in the apparel accessories and footwear sector by exploring and delivering initiatives to empower workers and improve their livelihoods through upskilling and capacity building.

1116,Processes to remediate negative informationrelated impacts and channels for consumers and endusers to raise concernsWe comply with the DSA. Our aim is to create a safer digital space where the fundamental rights of users are protected and to establish a level playing field for businesses. Notifiers consumers can report potential illegal content product image content etc. using a standardised form available on our website explaining why and what they are reporting. The report is recorded in our DSA database and assigned to the relevant team to investigate the complaint. Expert teams investigate and decide whether the product is illegal and communicate with the notifier. The notifier is entitled to respond to the communication only where there is a decision to not impose restrictions in which case the notifier is entitled to challenge the decision via another processform. This is also rerouted to the expert teams.When a product is made unavailable due a DSA violation we are required to inform all consumers who have bought the product within the last six months of the decision. We also publish a DSA transparency report on our corporate website with the findings from the reporting period. All cases are recorded in the DSA EU commission database. Sustainabilityspecific consumer complaints The DSA requires us to enable consumers to report potential legal violations or concerns inter alia environmental concerns e.g. products or productrelated claims with wrong misleading or missing environmental information or when a product does not fulfil mandatory ecodesign requirements. Such consumer complaints are reviewed by us investigated and where necessary result in the information in question being revised or removed to ensure accuracy and compliance. This has become a primary way in which we collect sustainabilityrelated consumer complaints and inquiries. We also receive consumer complaints and queries directly via our Customer Care team. When sustainabilityrelated complaints or questions are raised these are directed to the relevant business unit for further investigation as needed.Actions related to informationrelated impactsIn we aim to accompany our sustainability communication guidelines with a formal policy that will outline requirements and expectations for sustainabilityrelated communications. This will be incorporated into our partner onboarding process as well as apply to all internal employees who support the development of sustainabilityrelated content.Targets related to informationrelated impactsAt Zalando we have not adopted targets in line with the ESRS specifically addressing informationrelated impacts.

We define our consumers as anyone purchasing products from our websites and outlets and take the necessary measures to keep consumers informed about our assortment and their purchase while running a quality assurance programme that protects consumers from physical and chemical injuries.With regards to our material IROs we include all consumers and endusers who could be materially impacted by our business activities in the scope of our disclosures. In terms of material negative impacts inadequate product safety standards can result in individual incidents related to the goods we sell. This risk could lead to fines or reputational loss.Policies related to product and personal safetyQuality Assurance Manual QAM The QAM includes among other things product compliance requirements and our contractually expectations for our business partners. The QAM sets out binding minimum requirements for productrelated due diligence obligations including chemical and physical product characteristics as well as labelling obligations. It also specifies notification and reporting duties to support our internal safety procedures. We work closely with our partners to ensure product safety meet compliance requirements and manage potential corrective measures effectively under the EU General Product Safety Regulation. The QAM is communicated to all business partners on a biannual basis and is available for partners to download from an internal platform. The QAM is regularly updated by internal and external experts and approved by our SVP Corporate GovernanceGeneral Counsel. We provide business partners with a Corporate Compliance Newsletter each quarter offering a threetosixmonth compliance outlook. Internally the QAM is disseminated across all relevant functions. Compliance with the QAM requirements is continuously monitored by Zalando. The relevant procedures are set out in internal work instructions and are reviewed annually. We review relevant information and assess the impact of external factors focusing on compliance with legal and regulatory obligations and incorporate these into our QAM. We also engage with public bodies consumer associations and business partners to ensure comprehensive compliance and effectively address any deviation from our quality standards. Restricted Substance List RSL We have developed a RSL that defines binding minimum requirements for chemical parameters for all product groups in order to comply with statutory requirements of the European Commission and national governing bodies. The RSL serves to control the chemical compliance of all products offered to protect the environment the consumers and the people within our value chain. The RSL outlines the acceptable limits of potentially toxic or harmful substances that may be present in finished products used components materials and packaging. The policy applies to our private label brands as well as our retail and partner product ranges. All Zalando partners and brands are required to implement a robust chemical management system and due diligence testing to ensure compliance with our RSL and the relevant international standards and legislation. The RSL is published on our corporate website and is annexed to the QAM.

Investing in these relationships and protecting our business necessitates tools and processes that support and enable these requirements and aim to ensure that we meet the expectations of our consumers partners and employees.Among these tools is the privacy portal which all registered Zalando consumers can access through their accounts. The privacy portal aims to make exercising data subject rights such as accessing a consumers data or deleting an account easy and transparent.Our DMA identified a potential negative impact related to insufficient security in our IT systems which could lead to the loss of personal data belonging to employees and consumers and a potential risk of cyberattacks based on possible weaknesses in our IT systems and controls.Policies related to privacyWe strive to provide a high level of privacy and security for our consumers partners and employees through compliance with legislation and a comprehensive framework of policies and processes. The framework addresses the key impacts and potential risks aligning with our privacy standard.We are regulated under European and national data protection regulations and we closely monitor changes in legislation in order to properly adopt regulatory requirements. One of the main privacy related laws is the GDPR which regulates data protection and privacy in the EU and the EEA.

They have experience and expertise in business conduct particularly in the areas of corporate governance compliance corporate culture and political engagement as well as the management of supplier relationships. We report key compliance topics to the management board as well as to the audit committee of the supervisory board on a quarterly basis. The chairperson of the audit committee of the supervisory board reports regularly to the full supervisory board on the activities and conclusions of the audit committee in the area of corporate governance and business conduct matters. Key topics generally include insights into compliance investigation data and potential trends arising from these. These reporting formats offer the option for the compliance function to determine further focus topics where required.Identification and assessment of business conductrelated IROsThe potential material IROs related to our business conduct which were identified in the course of our DMA are stated in section Impacts risks and opportunities of ... General information. Policies related to business conductOur group policies are in line with our Code of Ethics and the principles of our founding mindset. Our quarterly engagement and culture survey regularly evaluates our current workplace culture combining both quantitative and qualitative insights. We promise to and expect from all employees an environment in which the values of appreciation speed entrepreneurship and personal responsibility are lived. All policies are therefore formulated in such a way that they do not stand in the way of fast and independent decisionmaking in which those concerned can take responsibility and act quickly.For the following policies subject to EU or local laws a companywide approval process for group policies is applicable according to which the policies are approved by a member of the management board the SVP Corporate GovernanceGeneral Counsel as well as contributing and affected parties such as the PO Tax Indirect Procurement Privacy andor Finance teams. In principle the policies apply to all entities and employees of the Zalando group. We communicate the group policies via various channels such as the companywide employee selfservice system and the intranet. In the mandatory compliance training employees receive further information about the Code of Ethics the group policy internal investigations the group policy benefits gifts events and expenses and the group policy authority to sign. New employees will be enrolled in the compliance training courses once they start their employment. Employees receive compliance refresher courses in a biannual cycle.

It also clarifies the assessment of contractual cash flows for example to assess whether instruments with ESGlinked features meet the SPPI criteria. Furthermore the amendments enhance disclosures related to contractually linked instruments as well as investments in equity instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income.Amendments to IFRS IFRS IFRS IFRS and IAS IFRS Accounting Standards Annual Improvements Volume Includes minor changes related to the application of hedge accounting for IFRS firsttime adopters disclosure of gain or loss on derecognition of financial assets with continuing involvement recognition of any difference from derecognition of lease liabilities in profit or loss and clarifies the definition of a de facto agent. IFRS Presentation and Disclosure in Financial StatementsSets out requirements for the presentation and disclosure of information in financial statements.

January early application permittedNoApplication is expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.Zalando assessed possible impacts of the new IFRS as well as related amendments to other applicable IFRS on our financial statements at initial application. IFRS introduces a new fivecategory classification system that will affect our consolidated income statement. The standard first defines the operating category that will include all items of income or expense that are not classified in one of the other four categories. The majority of items currently included in our EBIT will be allocated to this operating category. The investing category will mainly include income and expenses from investments accounted for using the equity method as well as from cash and cash equivalents. Those items are currently presented within our financial result and will be moved to the investing category. Income and expenses that arise from transactions that involve only the raising of finance or items that arise from transactions that do not involve only the raising of finance but are identified by other IFRS will be classified in the financing category. This will mainly include items that are currently presented in our financial result e.g. interest expenses on convertible bonds and lease liabilities. Items that do not fulfil these criteria shall be classified under other categories. For example income and expenses from hedging relationships shall be moved to the operating category. Foreign exchange differences currently presented in financial result that relate to income and expenses for items that will be classified in the financing category will be presented in this category accordingly. However foreign exchange differences related to cash and cash equivalents will be presented in the investing category and foreign exchange differences related to trade receivables or trade payables will be classified in the operating category. The income taxes category will include only items currently presented under income taxes. Lastly items required by IFRS will be classified in the discontinued operations category which is not expected to be relevant for Zalando.Three new subtotals will be required. The operating profit or loss shall comprise all income and expenses classified in the operating category. The profit before financing and interest expenses will include all income and expenses classified in the operating or investing category. This is not equivalent to our EBIT due to the items that will be moved from the financial result into the operating or investing category. Additionally a profit or loss subtotal will be required which is equal to our net incomeloss for the period. There will be changes to the consolidated statement of cash flows due to amendments to IAS . The starting point for the cash flow from operating activities using the indirect method will be the newly required operating profit or loss and not net incomeloss for the period. In addition interests paid and received that are currently only presented in the cash flow from operating activities will be classified as cash flow from financing activities interest paid or cash flow from investing activities interests and dividends received. With this change the free cash flow which is based on the cash flow from operating activities will be affected accordingly. Furthermore there are new disclosure requirements. Most relevant for Zalando this requires information on expenses by nature if the function of expenses method is used as well as disclosures for managementdefined performance measures that are companyspecific subtotals of income and expenses like EBIT or adjusted EBIT. Zalando will apply IFRS and related amendments of other standards for the annual reporting period beginning on January . The standard will be applied retrospectively according to IAS which requires a reconciliation for each line item of the prior period presented in the annual report . We will also prepare our interim financial statements in financial year in accordance with the new standard. Expected impacts are based on reasonable information available before this annual report was authorised for issue. They may change due to new information available at a later date. January early application permittedNoApplication is not expected to have any material effect as none of our subsidiaries provide consolidated separate or individual financial statements applying IFRS Accounting Standards.

1231,A business combination is a transaction in which an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses. Within the scope of the firsttime consolidation of such a business all acquired assets and liabilities are recognised in the statement of financial position at their fair value at the acquisition date. Any excess of the consideration transferred including any noncontrolling interest or any previously held equity interest over the proportionate fair value of identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities is shown as goodwill. Any shortfall is recorded in the statement of profit or loss as a gain on a bargain purchase.The consolidated financial statements comprise Zalando SE and its subsidiaries over which the company has control within the meaning of IFRS .The separate financial statements of the entities included in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the parent companys uniform accounting policies.Intercompany receivables and liabilities are offset against each other. Offsetting differences are recognised through profit or loss if they arise in the reporting period. The company eliminates intercompany profits or losses from intercompany supplies and services and recognises deferred tax benefits and expenses from consolidation entries through profit or loss. The consolidation of intercompany profits or losses involves offsetting intercompany revenue and other intercompany income against the corresponding expenses.Shares in associates i.e. entities over which the owner can exercise significant influence within the meaning of IAS are accounted for using the equity method. The same applies to joint ventures within the meaning of IFRS i.e. arrangements whereby two or more parties have joint control over the net assets of the arrangement. Such investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently updated to include any changes in the share of the investees joint venture net assets attributable to the investor joint venturer after the acquisition date.The consolidation policies were applied unchanged compared to the prior year.,,,,,,,0.42024911566739875,,,,,,,,,,,,

1238,At Zalando value in use is calculated using cash flow projections based on approved budgets. The duration of the detailed planning phase is based on the remaining useful life of the assets being tested and is capped at five years. In the case of a cashgenerating unit with allocated goodwill the terminal value is added to the planning phase. A constant annual growth factor is assumed for the terminal value. The costs of capital before tax used as a discount rate are based on instruments with a comparable risk profile. ,,,,,,0.3320610302832966,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1256,The group as lesseeAt the commencement date of a lease Zalando recognises a rightofuse asset and a lease liability for all leases except for shortterm leases i.e. leases with a lease term of months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. Zalando has chosen the practical expedient to recognise the lease payments associated with those exceptional leases as an expense when they are incurred.The lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability primarily comprise fixed payments less any lease incentives received and variable lease payments that typically depend on an index or rate initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date. A change in variable payments related to a change in the underlying index or rate will lead to a remeasurement of the lease liability at the point in time this change is effective. The present value of the lease payments is calculated using the term and risk equivalent incremental borrowing rate because the interest rate implicit in the lease typically cannot be readily determined. The lease term is based on the noncancellable period of a lease. Periods covered by an option to extend or terminate the lease are only included in the lease term if it is reasonably certain that such an option will be exercised or will not be exercised in the case of a termination option. In determining the lease term Zalando considers all relevant facts and circumstances to assess whether it is reasonably certain an option to extend a lease will be exercised or an option to terminate a lease will not be exercised. In particular Zalando takes into consideration future business needs the length of the noncancellable period as well as economic incentives like additional rentfree periods or penalties.Initially rightofuse assets are recognised at the amount of the corresponding lease liability plus initial direct costs as well as less any lease incentives received. Costs of dismantling and removal are considered if they relate to the lease asset. Rightofuse assets are subsequently ,,,,0.3340842628378364,,0.363007187046076,,,0.3845090784489732,,,0.4644262217107682,,,,,,,
1257,depreciated over the underlying lease term between one and years using the straightline method.Depreciation of rightofuse assets is presented within the functional area to which it relates. Interest expenses on lease liabilities are shown as interest and similar expenses. They are also included in cash flow from operating activities whereas cash payments for the principal portion of lease liabilities are presented as a separate line item in the cash flow from financing activities.SubleasesA lessor shall classify each lease including each sublease as an operating lease or a finance lease. A lease is classified as a finance lease if all of the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of an underlying asset have been substantially transferred to the lessee. Otherwise it is classified as an operating lease.Zalando classifies subleases by reference to the rightofuse asset arising from the head lease. Typically this assessment is based on the lease term of the sublease compared to the remaining lease term of the head lease. Whenever the lease term of the sublease is at least of the remaining lease term of the head lease Zalando classifies those leases as finance subleases otherwise they are classified as operating subleases. For operating subleases the accounting for the head lease remains unchanged and lease payments from the sublease are recognised as income when incurred. For finance subleases the corresponding rightofuse asset is derecognised and a receivable of an amount equal to the net investment in the sublease is presented. Any difference is recognised through profit or loss. To measure the net investment in the sublease Zalando uses the riskadjusted discount rate used for the head lease. ,,,,,,0.34839839171867343,,,,,,0.5124243451771082,,,,,,,
1258,The income tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred taxes. Taxes are recognised in profit or loss for the period unless they relate to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income in which case the corresponding taxes are also recognised in equity or in other comprehensive income.The current tax expense is calculated using the tax laws of the countries in which the entities operate and generate taxable income effective as of the reporting date.Management regularly prepares tax returns paying close attention to matters open to interpretation and recognises provisions based on the amounts that are expected to be payable to the tax authorities.Deferred taxes are calculated using the liability method on the basis of IAS . Deferred taxes are recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements and the tax accounts if these differences lead to deductable or taxable amounts in future periods. The measurement of deferred taxes is performed taking into account the tax rates and tax laws expected to apply at the time when the differences are reversed. This does not apply to tax laws enacted or substantively enacted to implement the ,,,,,,,,,,0.3258439877810002,,,,,,,,,
1259,Pillar Two model rules published by the OECD. Therefore we neither recognise nor disclose information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences carryforwards of unused tax credits and unused tax losses to the extent that it is sufficiently probable that a taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carryforward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the deferred tax assets to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered.The group offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and if the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.32637771895255463,,,,
1260,Inventories,,,,,,,,0.39032527359128,,,,,,,,,,,
1261,Merchandise accounted for as inventories is recognised at cost pursuant to IAS . The cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase purchase price import duties and other taxes as well as costs for transport handling and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. This also includes a systematic allocation of labour and overhead costs. Cost is calculated on the basis of an itembyitem measurement based on goods moving average prices. Supplier payments that are to be classified as a reduction of cost reduce the carrying amount of inventories. The same applies to discounts rebates and similar items that are deducted from the purchase price in determining the costs of purchase.Merchandise as of the reporting date is measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The net realisable value is the expected selling price less the costs necessary to make the sale. Adequate writedowns to net realisable value are made to allow for all risks from slowmoving goods andor reduced saleability. When the circumstances that previously caused merchandise to be written down below cost no longer exist the writedown is reversed.,,,0.4035001255482012,0.32858617299910153,,0.3494121780391792,0.5620236411508984,0.4617930307042695,0.33490462967034557,0.30837117172968515,,0.2956291024135968,,0.3764770258016284,,,,,0.3573456816226124

1263,General informationA financial instrument is a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed in the consolidated statement of financial position when Zalando becomes a contractual party to a financial instrument. Contracts are recognised irrespective of their classification as of the settlement date i.e. the date on which an asset is delivered to or by the entity. In contrast derivative financial instruments are recognised on the trade date. The trade date is the date that the company commits to purchasing or selling an asset. ,,,,,,,,0.35919773297034946,,,0.49775179765209315,0.29703571447942595,,,,,,,
1264,Financial instruments classified as financial assets and financial liabilities are generally not netted they are only netted if the group has a legally enforceable right to set off and intends to settle the amounts on a net basis. Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or the financial asset and all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset have been substantially transferred. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the contractual commitments have been discharged cancelled or have expired.The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would have been received when selling an asset or paid when transferring a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. If there are listed prices on an active market e.g. share prices these are used as a measurement base. If there is no active market reference is made to the market most favourable to the entity for measurement purposes.The amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability is the amount,,,,,,,,,,,0.4328268079222661,,,,,,,,
1268,adjusted for loss allowance for financial assets.The amortised cost of current receivables and liabilities generally corresponds to the nominal value or settlement amount.Financial assetsFinancial assets are classified as one of the following categories for the purpose of subsequent measurement,,,,,,,,,,,0.47199266708420445,0.2838783766045049,,,,,,,
1271,fair value through profit or loss.When financial assets are initially recognised they are measured at fair value except for trade receivables which Zalando measures at the amount determined by applying IFRS at initial recognition. For all categories except financial assets at fair value through profit or loss the transaction costs incurred are included in the initial recognition.The allocation to the aforementioned categories determines the subsequent measurement of financial assets. There are differing measurement rules for each category.Financial assets measured at amortised cost are those which are held in a business model whose objective is to hold the financial asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and for which the contractual terms give rise on specific dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding SPPI criterion. This measurement category is used for trade and other receivables other financial assets cash and cash equivalents and shortterm deposits.,,,,,,,,,,,0.42179731073735555,0.2961232845865998,,,,,,,
1272,The category of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income relates to financial assets that are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. On specified dates the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The fluctuations in value recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to profit or loss at the time the asset is derecognised. Impairment and foreign exchange gains or losses are nevertheless recognised in profit or loss. No financial assets were classified in this category in the financial year or in the prior year.All other financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Hence they are held within a business model whose objective is not to hold the financial asset to collect contractual cash flows or where cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Derivative financial instruments that are not effective hedging instruments as well as corporate investments are allocated to this category. Changes in the fair value of these financial assets are recognised through profit or loss.Impairment of financial assetsZalando recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses for all financial assets other than those measured at fair value through profit or loss. At each reporting date the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to a month expected credit loss general approach. If the credit risk has increased significantly the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit loss.For trade receivables Zalando applies the simplified approach of IFRS to measure the loss allowance at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit loss. Zalando uses a scenariobased approach for this purpose and takes into account saleschannel and countryspecific allowance rates based on expected risks of default and how long the trade receivables are past due. Trade receivables typically resulting from the use of deferred payment methods e.g. pay by invoice have due dates of a maximum of to days depending on the country in which the order is placed. For other receivables resulting from the purchase of receivables due from customers of our partners for sales concluded on the Zalando platform Zalando applies the general approach of IFRS . Because these receivables also have maximum due dates of to days the month expected credit loss is the same as the lifetime expected credit loss. Therefore as for trade receivables Zalando applies a scenariobased approach to determine expected credit losses for other receivables.Receivables together with the allowance recognised are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows have expired. This is the case if there is no realistic prospect of future recovery and all collateral has been realised.,,,,,,,0.49345397564128757,0.36125570332388307,,,0.4539108275630252,0.32497531259597484,,0.3789395108760634,,,,,0.34776995535811683
1273,Financial liabilitiesFinancial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs in the case of loans and borrowings. Zalando allocates financial liabilities to one of the following categories upon initial recognition,,,,,,,,,,,0.45002090554401913,0.2972211984799217,,,,,,,
1283,General informationProvisions are recognised in accordance with IAS when the group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.A best estimate is made of the amount of the provisions taking into consideration all the expected risks arising from the obligation. This refers to the amount that is most likely needed to settle the liability. Provisions with a residual term of more than one year are discounted on the reporting date.Dismantling obligationsThe group recognises provisions for dismantling obligations for leasehold improvements in the leased fulfilment centres office buildings and outlets. The provision is recognised at an amount equivalent to the present value of the estimated future dismantling obligations. The dismantling obligations are recognised as part of the cost of leasehold improvements for the corresponding amount. The estimated cash flows are discounted using a discount rate that adequately reflects the maturity and the risk profile. Unwinding of the obligation is recognised as an interest expense in the income statement.,,,0.39427092499206506,0.3731979673706383,0.4502569847413405,0.44554352733123925,0.4324869239546102,0.376588687831988,0.3858364700455814,0.3184069013563378,0.42610111454352434,0.41164215701601553,0.35058198940374863,0.4401474297971164,0.3599625159097653,0.30501829390486207,,,0.4402321377335385
1285,The sharebased payment programmes in the group are accounted for as equitysettled sharebased payments. This also applies to sharebased payment transactions in which Zalando has the choice of settling in cash or shares as long as there is no present obligation for Zalando to settle in cash. Zalando recognises the equitysettled sharebased payments as expenses at the fair value of the granted options. Expense recognition and the addition to the capital reserves are performed over the contractually agreed vesting period. The vesting period is the period in which the performance and service conditions must be fulfilled. The fair value of the options granted is measured at the grant date and not adjusted subsequently.,,,,,,,,,0.33029531904685333,,,,,,,,,,

1298,Revenue is recognised in accordance with the provisions of IFRS when the goods or services promised are transferred to the customer. Contractual performance obligations are typically satisfied when goods are handed over to the customer. Revenue is measured at the amount of the consideration Zalando expects to receive in exchange for transferring the promised goods and services. For our retail business we conclude that Zalando is the principal in these revenue arrangements because we control the goods before transferring them to the customer. Revenue is therefore recognised in full. However in the partner business we do not control the goods before transferring them to the customer. Hence revenue is recognised in the amount of the commission that Zalando as agent of these revenue arrangements expects to receive from the partner. In services ZEOS Fulfilment and ZMS we render to partners Zalando recognises all fees within revenue that we expect to receive from our partners for rendering those services. Revenue is recorded net of sales deductions taxes and duties.Zalando identifies its performance obligations as the distinct goods or services promised in a contract with a customer. Apart from Zalando Plus the goods or services promised by Zalando goods delivery and return with a return policy of up to days and customer care express delivery or minimum order fee create a bundle that is distinct i.e. the identified performance obligation. In contrast services promised to our partners partner business ZEOS Fulfilment or ZMS are separately identifiable performance obligations.When selling merchandise to customers Zalando transfers control over the promised goods and services at a specific point in time. This is generally the case when the goods are delivered. For services rendered to our partners partner business ZEOS Fulfilment or ZMS revenue is also recognised at the point in time the underlying performance obligations towards our partners are satisfied. In contrast performance obligations under Zalando Plus are standready obligations that are satisfied over time. Therefore revenue is recognised on a straightline basis over the month subscription period.In assessing the consideration to be received Zalando takes into account the right of return granted to the customers in the retail and the partner business. Revenue is not recognised unless sufficient evidence is available on the probability of the nonexercise of these rights based on past experience. The expected volume of returns is estimated based on saleschannel and countryspecific return rates and recognised as a reduction of revenue.Zalando offers its customers a range of diverse payment options. Depending on the payment option and the country in which the order is placed payments are typically due within a maximum of to days.,,,,,,,0.5184867394452695,0.37594917384026877,0.36001354031593075,,,0.34429805195116564,,0.39244168449350236,,,,,0.3462670625511594
1300,Zalando presents the expected returns of goods on a gross basis in the income statement and reduces revenue by the full amount of sales that is estimated to be returned. Cost of sales that are recorded in full upon delivery of the goods is then corrected by the estimated amount of returns.Zalando also presents expected returns on a gross basis in the statement of financial position. In this context a right to recover goods from expected returns is recognised in other nonfinancial assets. The amount of the asset corresponds to the cost of the goods delivered for which returns are expected taking into account the costs incurred for processing the return and the expected losses resulting from disposal of these goods.Trade receivables for which delivered goods are expected to be returned are also derecognised. For customer receivables already paid and for which returns are expected in the future Zalando recognises a refund liability visvis the customer in other current financial liabilities.,,,,,,,0.46716174867860166,0.3774031261032328,0.3225649207011341,,,,,,,,,,

1304,Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received since Zalando complies with all the attached conditions. Investment subsidies are deducted from the cost of the subsidised assets in the statement of financial position.Government grants received for compensating costs are recognised through profit or loss and offset against the corresponding expense in the period when the entitlement arises.,,,,,,,,,,,,0.290623669777098,,,,,,,

1369,. Rightofuse assets and lease liabilitiesZalandos leases are related mainly to buildings e.g. fulfilment centres office buildings and outlets. These contracts include options to extend and in some cases terminate the contracts. Furthermore these contracts include variable payments depending on the development of consumer price indexes as well as payments relating to nonlease components e.g. service costs. Other leases recognised in rightofuse assets relate mainly to other equipment e.g. company cars as well as technical equipment and machinery.At the end of the reporting period rightofuse assets totalled .m EUR prior year .m EUR. Additions to rightofuse assets amounted to .m EUR prior year.m EUR and relate mainly to the commencement of the lease contracts of a fulfilment centre in France as well as an office building and new outlets in Germany. As of the reporting date the carrying amount of the lease receivable for an office sublease in Berlin that commenced in was .m EUR prior year .m EUR and the sum of the undiscounted lease payments to be received amounted to .m EUR prior year .m EUR. The difference of .m EUR prior year .m EUR represents unearned finance income. In each of the following five years undiscounted lease payments of .m EUR prior year .m EUR will be received. The remainder of the undiscounted lease payments of .m EUR prior year .m EUR is due over the course of the remaining lease term after this fiveyear period.During the financial year Zalando recognised depreciation in the amount of .m EUR prior year .m EUR. Of this an amount of .m EUR prior year .m EUR was recognised in cost of sales .m EUR prior year .m EUR in selling and distribution costs and .m EUR prior year .m EUR in administrative expenses. A total amount of .m EUR prior year .m EUR of the recognised depreciation resulted from the impairment of rightofuse assets for buildings which are not planned to be used for our own business any longer.

1375,Variable payments relate to rent payments depending on consumer price indexes. As a rule adjustments will be made where applicable once a year. On average the rent payable changes at a rate of about of the change of the underlying index. In additional payments for such indexbased rent adjustments totalled .m EUR prior year .m EUR. From the groups perspective options to extend the lease contracts are material. These vary from between three and up to years. Exercising all of the options that have not been included in the measurement of the lease liabilities could lead to an additional total cash outflow of .m EUR prior year .m EUR. Furthermore Zalando leases office and photo equipment as well as cars. Such leases are in general either shortterm leases or leases for assets of low value. Corresponding to our accounting policies described in .. Accounting policies for these contracts Zalando applies the practical expedient in IFRS . and recognises lease payments on a straightline basis over the respective lease term in accordance with IFRS ..

1518,In line with the revised internal management approach we have adjusted our external reporting from Q to reflect our new operating segments of BC and BB. Our external reporting is in line with our internal reporting. Reporting to the management of Zalando for purposes of internal steering fundamentally corresponds to the principles of financial reporting described in .. General principles in accordance with IFRS.The BC segment comprises the majority of our fashion and lifestyle business i.e. our former fashion store segment including the formerly named wholesale and partner business and offprice segment Lounge by Zalando and Outlets as well as our platform service ZMS. The BB segment comprises services that provide the BB products we offer to our partners both on and off the Zalando platform to meet their business needs i.e. ZEOS Fulfilment including ZFS and MCF Tradebyte and Highsnobiety.Revenue and profitability generated through external business partners as well as internal transactions between our segments are reported to the chief operating decisionmaker as required by IFRS . As a result the segment reporting continues to include a reconciliation column to reconcile the segment figures covering both internal and external transactions with the consolidated group figures showing only external transactions. The internal transactions relate to the exchange of goods and services between segments.The management board measures the performance of the segments on the basis of revenue and adjusted EBIT which for segment reporting purposes are defined in the same way as for the consolidated financial statements of the group.

1532,Please refer to sections .. and .. of the notes to the consolidated financial statements subsections inventories for information on the accounting policies applied and the assumptions used.The financial statement riskThe consolidated statement of financial position as at December includes inventories in particular merchandise of EUR million . of total assets after impairments of EUR million.The value of goods initially measured at cost taking into account incidental acquisition costs and purchase price reductions must be reduced if their expected net realisable value no longer covers the cost. Risks from aboveaverage storage periods andor reduced usability are to be taken into account by appropriate deductions in the net realisable value. The net realisable is the estimated selling price less the costs necessary to make the sale. The determination of net realisable value is based on assumptions with regard to the selling price achievable in the normal course of business less the costs necessary to make the sale which are derived from historically observed data. The age seasonality of the inventories and the realisability in the sales channels of future sales are of particular importance.The result of this valuation is highly dependent on the assessment of the legal representatives with regard to the factors influencing the value and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. There is a risk for the consolidated financial statements that inventories are not valued appropriately.,,,,,,,0.5167608772518787,0.3651571530059679,,,,,,,,,,,
1533,Our audit approach Based on our understanding of the process we assessed the design and implementation of identified internal controls relating to the determination of the expected net realisable value. In doing so we analysed the determination of the costs necessary to make the sale allocated to the sales and the loss rates observed in the past for the respective distribution and utilisation channels.Furthermore we examined the acquisition costs for a randomly selected sample and the season allocation of goods for a randomly selected sample.In addition we assessed the Companys analyses of the seasonality of fashion and constantly changing trends and based on the Companys historical experience evaluated whether the discounts recorded were appropriate. We assessed these historical empirical values on the basis of the analyses of sales results prepared by the Company. We assessed the specific valuation allowances recognised for outlet goods on the basis of comparable sales transactions in the financial year.Finally we set expected values for the required valuation allowances on the basis of the aforementioned calculation methods and compared these with the companys calculations.Our observations The assumptions used to determine the value adjustments for inventories goods and the judgement exercised by the legal representatives are appropriate.,,,,,,,0.44143238007815777,,,,,,,,,,,,
1535,Please refer to sections .. subsection Revenue and .. subsection Revenue recognition of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on the accounting policies applied and the assumptions made.The financial statement riskIn the consolidated statement of comprehensive income Zalando SE recognises revenue from the sale of goods of EUR million. This revenue accounts for around of the Groups total revenue. Revenue from the sale of merchandise has a significant impact on the Groups earnings figures and is one of the most important performance indicators for the Group.Zalando SE recognises revenue from the sale of goods when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised asset to a customer. An asset is considered transferred when the customer obtains control of the asset. In the context of the sale of goods using the Zalando online shop this is the point in time when the goods are delivered to the customer.Customers of Zalando SE have the option of returning goods free of charge within the statutory cancellation periods as well as within the return periods granted by Zalando. The expected returns not to be recognised as revenue are calculated by the legal representatives. This calculation is based on methods data and assumptions in particular regarding expected return rates.,,,,,,,0.4814901199404277,,,,,,,,,,,,
1536,Due to the high transaction volume in the sale of goods and the general risk of fictitious sales the judgemental decision as to when control of the goods is transferred to the customer and the uncertain estimates of expected returns there is a risk for the consolidated financial statements that revenue from the sale of goods does not exist is not recognised in the correct amount or is incorrectly recognised.Our audit approach As part of our audit procedures we reperformed the revenue recognition process for goods from the order to the receipt of payment on the basis of the process documentation provided to us. We also assessed compliance with the requirements for revenue recognition set out in IFRS . Furthermore we tested the effectiveness of internal controls implemented in relation to existence and periodisation of revenue. In particular this also includes the effectiveness of ITsupported controls. In addition we examined the accounting journal for manually recorded revenue postings.In addition we tested the timing amount and existence of the revenue recognised by reconciling the recognised amounts with the related purchase orders external proof of delivery discounts and payments received. This was based on revenue from the sale of goods in the financial year selected on the basis of a random sampling procedure. We verified the determination of the goods in transit as at the reporting date by verification of the actual delivery of shipments to assess the judgment made regarding the transfer of control to the customer. We compared the amounts of expected returns not recognised as revenue with historical return rates and also performed a comparison with the goods returned up to the completion of our audit. We tested the data underlying the determination of actual deliveries and returns for a randomly selected sample.Our observations Zalando SEs approach for the recognition of revenue from the sale of goods is appropriate. The assumptions made by Zalando SE regarding the transfer of control to the customer and the determination of expected returns are appropriate.Other informationManagement respectively the supervisory board are responsible for the other information.
