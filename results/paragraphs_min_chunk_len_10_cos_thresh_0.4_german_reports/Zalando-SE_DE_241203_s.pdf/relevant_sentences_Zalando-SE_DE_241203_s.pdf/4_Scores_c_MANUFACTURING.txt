Chemical pollution processes such as bleaching printing and finishing often involve harmful chemicals that if not properly managed can be released into the environment.The material environmental impacts resulting from the DMA occur during the production and distribution stages including raw material extraction textile production and transportation. These stages are outside our direct operations. Within our own operations emissions are comparatively nonsignificant. For example noncarbon emissions to air of our fulfilment centres are significantly lower than the emissions generated by the manufacturing processes. Similarly microplastics potentially generated from our operations if present are minimal compared to the microplastics generated during the use phase of a fashion product over its life span. We did not screen site locations for pollutionrelated IROs as none of the sites under our operation and control have emission sources that require reporting according to Regulation EC No of the European Parliament and of the Council European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register EPRTR Regulation. Affected communities along the value chain were not directly consulted during the DMA. For further information on stakeholder engagement in our DMA please refer to Impacts risks and opportunities in section .. General information. For these reasons our disclosures on pollution focus on our policies and actions related to chemical management. Accordingly we have not yet established any groupwide policies actions or targets in relation to pollution of air water soil and microplastics in line with the ESRS. Reporting on pollution metrics disclosure requirements ESRS E and E for our own operations is not included as it is considered not material to Zalando according to our DMA.Policies related to pollutionTo manage upstream and downstream impacts and comply with regulations we have developed a chemical management system. This includes the Restricted Substances List RSL to determine chemical requirements and limits for harmful substances in products. For private labels the Manufacturing Restricted Substances List MRSL restricts chemicals in production aligned with Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals standards.

Recyclable content in products Current reporting guidelines do not yet define how to assess the recyclable content of fashion products. After thoroughly analysing existing industry standards and regulations related to recyclability and metric methodologies we explored the possibility of establishing an internal metric for product recyclability. However we concluded that the available definitions and methodologies do not meet the qualitative characteristics QC of information required by ESRS . Specifically we are unable to ensure faithful representation QCQC or provide comparable data over time QCQC. CSRD aims to standardise sustainability reporting across companies with sectorspecific standards expected to result in reliable and comparable information. In line with this objective we have excluded the recyclability of products from the sustainability statement as we believe current methodologies would not deliver the level of transparency and consistency required.Recyclable content in product packaging Our current methodology considers product packaging recyclable if the material making up of the product packaging meets specific criteria for recycling processes. According to the minimum standard defined by the Central Agency Packaging Register Zentrale Stelle Verpackungsregister mechanically recyclable means that the packaging can be sorted and processed using available industrial recycling technologies to produce highquality recyclates. This involves assessing the material composition of the packaging the presence of appropriate sorting and recycling infrastructure and ensuring the packaging can substitute virgin material in typical applications after recycling. We consider a material as recyclable when we have self declarations from suppliers or when the specifications of the material indicate that it is paper paperboard or cardboard and aligns with the definition of fibrous material in the standard mentioned above.The rate of recyclable content in products packaging in is ..Waste In the fashion ecommerce sector waste generation primarily comes from two sources packaging and textile waste.

Material IROs list The detailed DMA results are listed in the table below according to the order of the ESRS. The material sustainability matters are structured in alignment with the ESRS in topics subtopics and subsubtopics. The table outlines the level of our responsibility and the associated triggers for each material IRO. For each identified impact we evaluated whether it leads to risks or opportunities particularly those arising from dependencies on key resources such as natural human or financial capital.Additionally the assessment considers not only risks and opportunities directly linked to identified impacts but also those that stem from resource dependencies where no direct impact may be observed. This ensures that risks and opportunities that arise independently of specific impacts such as broader market or resource dynamics are also captured in our analysis. This comprehensive approach helps us identify potential risks and opportunities both impactrelated and nonimpactrelated ensuring a thorough understanding of our sustainability landscape. The table includes information on the level of responsibility that each material IRO entails. This responsibility is categorised as caused contributed or linked to. These triggers can stem from factors within our control our business relationships or our dependencies on external resources. In the table VC refers to the value chain and OO stands for own operations covering our direct activities. The time horizons are aligned to ESRS and divided into actual year which reflects immediate realised impacts and potential years or beyond years which captures longerterm forecasted or anticipated impacts.

Apart from economic activity . we did not identify any other material CapEx OpEx or Taxonomyrelated turnover. For this evaluation we used a materiality threshold of . on CapEx OpEx and turnover. We only report an eligible activity if it meets at least one of the thresholds. However total CapEx OpEx and turnover are calculated without applying a materiality threshold. Hence turnover disclosed for Taxonomynoneligible activities is the total revenue of the group for the financial year according to IAS .a in the amount of .m EUR prior year .m EUR as disclosed in our consolidated financial statements for and further described under .. . Revenue in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. We have allocated all of the calculated Taxonomyeligible CapEx and OpEx to the environmental objective of climate change mitigation. In addition only one economic activity was identified for which Taxonomyeligible CapEx and OpEx were calculated. This avoided any double counting.Furthermore we assessed the proportion of our CapEx that qualifies as environmentally sustainable and is therefore reported as CapEx related to Taxonomyaligned economic activities. This assessment was based on the criteria laid down in Article of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. Because our CapEx is only related to the purchase of output we connected with the owners of the respective facilities to collect the relevant information. The information obtained relating to the technical screening criteria including both the substantial contribution and the DNSH principles was insufficient to perform the assessment. As a result we were not able to qualify our Taxonomyeligible CapEx related to the leasing of buildings as Taxonomyaligned CapEx for the financial year. This correspondingly also applies to related OpEx. Furthermore since we did not identify any Taxonomyeligible turnover we could not calculate any Taxonomyaligned turnover.

All product categories such as fashion footwear accessories and electronics are reported in aggregate form. The resource inflow metrics refer to all products and materials used for the production of products and packaging. The reported data reflects the materials in their original state including product and packaging weight and material composition as they enter our facilities. The resource inflow metrics were calculated using all available article and packaging data including weight material composition and sustainably sourced and recycled materials data. This includes materials adhering to thirdparty certifications or licensed or trademarked standards such as the Global Recycle Standard and the Global Organic Textile Standard. Packaging material is considered sustainably sourced if it meets one of the following conditions i the supplier provides material that is specifically FSCcertified ii the supplier holds an FSC certificate for their company and Zalando includes a contractual requirement that all materials delivered must be FSCcertified or iii the packaging is labelled as FSC MIX or FSC RECYCLED confirming compliance with FSC sustainability standards. Sustainably sourced and recycled material data undergo automated validation processes to ensure accuracy and applicability. Additionally a binary classification system is applied to distinguish between technical and biological materials. Data duplication is prevented via various mechanisms including i building distinct article provision into the calculation methodology ii ensuring comparability of data across metrics iii comparing of aggregate data results with GHG accounting results and iv testing results for duplication prior to calculation.As a multibrand retail platform Zalandos ability to acquire product sustainabilityrelated data is partly limited. We know that many of our business partners struggle to significantly increase the use of sustainably sourced materials in their own assortments due to technological challenges in innovation and price premiums for many of these materials and customers willingness to pay more for sustainable products. Even when our partners have successfully integrated these materials into their assortments the lack of unified data standards evolving regulatory requirements and difficulty in data sharing processes presents an added challenge to share this information upstream with a multibrand retailer like Zalando. We anticipate that the use of such materials throughout the fashion sector will organically increase in coming years as regulatory ecodesign and reporting requirements continue to expand in Europe. However we aim to continue enabling and encouraging business partners on our platform to adopt sustainablysourced recycled materials and design strategies that support the circular economy through our sustainable sourcing policy and our voluntary sustainabilityrelated claim framework.

Additionally we mapped the IROs across our value chain in terms of time horizons and our role in relation to the impacts or risks and opportunities.Step IRO assessment IROs were assessed via categories defined by the ESRS. Impact materiality considers the likelihood and severity of impacts and financial materiality considers the likelihood and magnitude of potential financial effects. In the case of a potential negative human rights impact the severity of the impact takes precedence over its likelihood.Impact materiality scoring methodology The impacts were assessed and rated based on their severity and likelihood. Severity is determined by factors such as scale scope and irremediable character as outlined in ESRS .

Merchandise accounted for as inventories is recognised at cost pursuant to IAS . The cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase purchase price import duties and other taxes as well as costs for transport handling and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. This also includes a systematic allocation of labour and overhead costs. Cost is calculated on the basis of an itembyitem measurement based on goods moving average prices. Supplier payments that are to be classified as a reduction of cost reduce the carrying amount of inventories. The same applies to discounts rebates and similar items that are deducted from the purchase price in determining the costs of purchase.Merchandise as of the reporting date is measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The net realisable value is the expected selling price less the costs necessary to make the sale. Adequate writedowns to net realisable value are made to allow for all risks from slowmoving goods andor reduced saleability. When the circumstances that previously caused merchandise to be written down below cost no longer exist the writedown is reversed.

Report Reporting of the processes and results of each years cycle is conducted in adherence to the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act and the guidance of the competent authority Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control Bundesamt für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle BAFA. Proactive risk management As outlined above our Code of Conduct serves as the standard foundation for our contractual relations. To monitor alignment with our ethical standards we implemented a tracking mechanism to evaluate the implementation status of the Code of Conduct within our contractual landscape. To review compliance of our suppliers we conduct social standard audits at facilities belonging to our direct logistics and customer care suppliers and require social audits with industrywide accepted standards such as the Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit or Business Social Compliance Initiative from factories supplying our private labels. In we evaluated social audit reports from private labels Tier suppliers December . We conducted social standard audits in our fulfilment area covering customer care and logistic centre providers. Reactive risk identification and mitigationTo ensure workers and other stakeholders have channels in which to effectively raise their concerns we offer two whistleblowing tools which allow workers to anonymously report potential issues and incidents. The tools are available to any external party and can be accessed via our corporate website. One of these is the Speak Up tool which is additionally available in languages as well as via mobile app and hotline.In addition to these whistleblowing tools our membership in the International Accord for Health and Safety in the Garment and Textile Industry formerly the International Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh enables our private labels to receive grievances reported through the Accords established complaints mechanism in factories in Bangladesh and Pakistan. Any grievance that is connected to our private labels supply chain is also fed into our remediation framework and followed up accordingly with the supplier concerned. When potential breaches are identified we investigate and respond to them in a systematic way to ensure they are effectively addressed. Our investigation and remediation process provides internal teams with a standardised approach to potential violations of all our defined standards. All reports are acknowledged within seven days of receipt and appropriate measures including audits and interviews are taken to thoroughly investigate claims. When we confirm the occurrence of a violation we require our business partners to implement suitable remediation measures which we follow up on to ensure compliance with our

standards. If the business partner fails to engage in appropriate remediation measures or if the violation is of such severity that it warrants immediate business consequences we will pause and potentially terminate the business relationship.All information received and retained during the investigations is handled confidentially and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Our policies namely the thirdparty investigation policy and our Code of Conduct explicitly prohibit actions against individuals who raise concerns in good faith.In we opened investigations into potential human rights violations in our supply chain One led to a termination of the business relationship compared to two in a human rights violation in our supply chain could not be proven in eight cases compared to six in and nine other investigations are still ongoing including the case that has already led to the termination of the business relationship as the execution of this decision is still an ongoing process. We place great value on the option of anonymous reporting. Accordingly we are limited in our ability to follow the source of reports we receive leading to limited insights into whether workers in the supply chain make use of our reporting possibilities. Recognising the importance of continuous improvement we assess the effectiveness of our measures throughout our due diligence practices including our grievance and remediation measures using data analysis industry exchange and engagement with expert organisations. Our data analysis involves comparing data points from the risk assessments investigations and remediation yearoveryear as well as reviewing the audit outcome development. We monitor incoming complaints via our reporting channels in quarterly review cycles and present these to the management board and to the audit committee of our supervisory board. In this review incoming complaints are classified according to the legal area of the accusation as well as the severity of the accused constellation amongst others. In this way we are able to identify patterns and trends and react accordingly.

Our skilling goal aligned with our previous do.MORE strategy was reached in Q . In collaboration with Shimmy Technologies and RISE formerly BSRs HERproject we extended training initiatives to the upstream supply chain benefiting workers in two factories in Bangladesh. The training included digital literacy efficiency gender equality financial literacy workplace communication and health and wellbeing. This has resulted in improved efficiency driven by better endtoend process understanding and optimised factory operations. Additionally workers have gained valuable knowledge on gender equality health hygiene and financial planning thus enhancing their daily lives.In addition we aim to act as an enabler by not only focusing on internal projects but also externalising our work. A key aspect of this is collaborating with stakeholders and local organisations to understand industry challenges on site and follow best practices. We are committed to engaging at multiple levels from retailertoretailer partnerships and brand collaborations to working with external stakeholders including government representatives and NGOs. We engage with legitimate interest groups because they advocate for workers rights bring valuable expertise and are often well known to either local workers or the civil society andor union organisations to which they belong. Their credibility helps ensure we follow best practices while supply chain workers awareness of NGOs fosters trust. This collaboration allows us to gain deeper insights into the specific needs and concerns of workers enabling us to tailor our initiatives and measures more effectively.

Material IROs and their interaction with strategy and business model and Interests and views of stakeholdersDecent work is one of two strategic sustainability focus areas in our updated group strategy. Decent work means creating opportunities for productive work in conditions of freedom equity security and human dignity. Focusing on decent work is vital for ensuring the fair treatment of workers in our supply chain. Our decent work focus supports our commitment to respect human rights throughout our operations and supply chain. Although we depend on a complex global supply chain that can pose significant risks to workers we strive to ensure decent work and fair treatment for all individuals involved in bringing our product portfolio to our customers.Our DMA identified potential negative impacts related to forced labour child labour human trafficking inadequate wages and excessive working hours. Denial of freedom of association and collective bargaining agreements pose further risks as does potential discrimination against vulnerable groups including Indigenous peoples minority groups migrant workers sexual minorities and women and children. These risks can stem from insufficient governance and enforcement e.g. of child labour laws in factories and their identification can be complicated due to insufficient and inaccurate worker data. The employment of migrant workers especially those having irregular status further heightens the risk of forced labour while wage noncompliance and a lack of strong regulatory frameworks contribute to significant wage disparities. Notably a lack of occupational health and safety OHS systems threatens worker safety.In addition to our own risk assessments industry reports indicate the following areas of potential concern
