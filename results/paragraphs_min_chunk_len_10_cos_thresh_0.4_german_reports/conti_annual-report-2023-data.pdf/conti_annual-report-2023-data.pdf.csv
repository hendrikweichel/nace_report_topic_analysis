The aim in the medium term is to use these measures to increase the diversity of the Executive Board even further. The Supervisory Board also pays attention to the diversity of its own composition. For the Supervisory Board diversity refers to age gender background and professional experience among other things. The Supervisory Board is convinced that it will achieve diversity in its composition in particular by fulfilling the profile of skills and expertise and meeting the targets for its composition. ,,,,,,,,,,0.3020098356792633,,,,,,,,,

206,Our goal is to finance ongoing investment requirements from the operating cash flow. Other investment projects such as major acquisitions should be financed from a balanced mix of equity and debt depending on the ratio of net indebtedness to equity gearing ratio and the liquidity situation to achieve constant improvement in the respective capital market environment. In general the gearing ratio should be below in the coming years. If justified by extraordinary financing reasons or specific market circumstances we can rise above this ratio under certain conditions. The equity ratio should exceed . In the reporting year the equity ratio was . and the gearing ratio .. Gross indebtedness amounted to .million as at December . Key financing instruments are the syndicated loan with a revolving credit line of .billion that has been granted until December and bonds issued on the capital market. Our gross indebtedness should be a balanced mix of liabilities to banks and other sources of financing on the capital market. For shortterm financing in particular we use a wide range of financing instruments. As at the end of this mix consisted of bonds a syndicated loan other bank liabilities and other indebtedness based on gross indebtedness. The syndicated loan that was renewed ahead of schedule in December consists of a revolving tranche of .billion and has an original term of five years. The margin for the loan will also depend on the Continental Groups sustainability performance. If the Continental Group achieves the performance improvements in sustainability as set out in detail in the loan agreement this will reduce the margin nonachievement will result in a margin increase. Continental has exercised two options each extending the term of the loan by one year. This ensures the financing commitment of the banks until December. The company strives to have at its disposal unrestricted liquidity of about .billion. This is supplemented by committed unutilized credit lines from banks in order to cover liquidity requirements at all times. These requirements fluctuate during a calendar year owing in particular to the seasonal nature of some business areas. In addition the amount of liquidity required is also influenced by corporate growth. Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents amounted to .million as at December . There were also committed and unutilized credit lines of .million. As at December .million of the revolving credit line of .billion had been utilized. Around of gross indebtedness is financed on the capital market in the form of bonds. The interest coupons vary between . and . p.a. In Continental redeemed two maturing bonds in the amounts of .million and .million. In conjunction with this and in order to optimize the maturity profile of its indebtedness Continental issued two new bonds in June and August. One bond with a volume of .million and a term of five years and a second bond with a volume of .million and a term of three and a half years were placed with investors. Both bonds have an interest rate of . p.a. In addition to the forms of financing already mentioned there were also bilateral credit lines with various banks in the amount of .million as at December . Continentals corporate financing instruments currently also include saleofreceivables programs and commercial paper programs. As in the previous year Continental had two commercial paper programs in Germany and the USA in . Neither of these two programs had been utilized as at the end of . Maturity profile Continental strives for a balanced maturity profile particularly with respect to its capital market liabilities in order to be able to repay the amounts due each year from free cash flow as far as possible. Aside from shortterm indebtedness most of which can be rolled on to the next year two bonds in the amounts of .million and .million respectively will mature in . The other bonds issued in the period from to require repayments of .million in .million in .million in and .million in . ,,,,0.3481942389473645,,,,,0.3138112521740702,,,,,,,,,,

253,Within the Executive Board the Executive Board member for Group Human Relations director of Labor Relations and Group Sustainability is responsible for sustainability. Sustainability management within the Continental Group is regulated by a dedicated internal sustainability policy. The Group Sustainability group function is further supplemented by sustainability functions in the group sectors as well as coordinators in several business areas and countries. The sustainability functions in the group sectors and in the Continental Group were further expanded and strengthened over the course of . The Group Sustainability Steering Committee is responsible for assessing interdepartmental issues weighing up opportunities and risks and discussing relevant Executive Board decisions in advance. In fiscal it consisted of the entire Executive Board the heads of the sustainability functions at corporate level and group sector level as well as the heads of other relevant group functions. The committee is chaired by the Executive Board member for Group Human Relations director of Labor Relations and Group Sustainability and managed by the head of the Group Sustainability group function. Some of the group sectors have their own interdepartmental sustainability committees which are coordinated by the relevant sustainability functions. The sustainability performance indicators are consolidated in the Continental Groups sustainability scorecard which is approved annually by the Group Sustainability Steering Committee on behalf of the Executive Board. The scorecard is based on defined quality criteria for the indicators is continuously developed further and establishes the formal basis for integrating sustainability into other corporate processes. The topic of sustainability is also an integral part of the Continental Groups strategy development. Significant investments must be reviewed and assessed as to their contribution to sustainability as a standard part of the approval process. For the Automotive Tires and ContiTech group sectors detailed roadmaps for the implementation of sustainability ambitions in the relevant topic areas are under development. ,,0.33682953567077717,0.3662098600584176,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

274, emissions in accordance with the GHG Protocol we aim to achieve carbon neutrality by at the latest in line with our sustainability ambition. To this end we have identified various levers throughout the value chain. These relate to the use phase of our products coupled with the global shift toward emissionfree mobility and industry product design and the conversion of materials used to renewable and recycled materials as well as a general transition to circular processes. For more information on our concepts in this respect see the sections on emissionfree mobility and industry and circular economy in this combined nonfinancial statement. It will also be necessary to increase the use of green electricity along the supply chain. The Business Partner Code of Conduct was expanded accordingly with a view to carbon neutrality in and reviewed in fiscal . The implementation of carbon neutrality throughout the value chain is managed in the individual group sectors each of which is responsible for taking appropriate measures. In addition achieving carbon neutrality throughout our value chains requires joint sustainability efforts with customers suppliers and other partners. The Continental Groups climate goal and ambition for were reviewed by the Science Based Targets initiative SBTi in . On the basis of the method used the linear derivations for were validated and confirmed as being compliant with the Paris climate agreement. The derived absolute emission reductions for Scope and Scope are set to keep us on track for the .C pathway. With NetZeroNow our immediate action program for climate change mitigation we also offer customers and the Continental group sectors an additional building block to support their individual climate strategies. The program is offered for the business with emissionfree and combustionengine vehicles as well as the industrial business and is also used internally for example at events.

277, removals are calculated individually within the group sectors. The amount of negative emissions used under NetZeroNow is determined and documented accordingly within the group sectors. Continental has purchased a quota of certified projects. Appropriate certificates are issued to Continental in stages and subsequently deleted from the register. A systematic process is then in place at corporate level to ensure that appropriate issued and deleted certificates are available for the amount used by the group sectors in the respective fiscal year and that these are not used more than once in the internal allocation across fiscal years and group sectors. ,,0.3350201641949567,,0.3716748819171709,0.38444957834218335,0.3611354468432433,,,,,,,,,0.2940719717311003,,,,0.374457304650694

308, for example. It does not include harmless emissions such as steam nontoxic biodegradable particle emissions or minimal noise emissions. Of central importance for our ambition are the requirements and speed of transformation of our customers industries and markets as well as the resulting transformation opportunities and risks. Concept Continental is shaping the transformation toward emissionfree mobility and industry with customeroriented solutions such as for electric mobility emissionfree railway engineering bicycles and wind turbines. In doing so we rely both on new product developments and on the further development of our existing product portfolio. Components software and products from Continental can be found in a wide range of electric vehicles for example from tires to highperformance computers and interior surfaces. For current examples of innovative products and systems from Continental see the Research and Development section of this annual report. The respective group sectors and business areas are responsible for implementing this sustainability ambition particularly with regard to portfolio development product strategies and business models and are supported by the group functions of the Continental Group. To this end relevant aspects have been and will continue to be incorporated in portfolio analyses and are included in the strategy and business development processes for the group sectors and business areas. For the implementation of our concept with respect to emissionfree mobility and industry we record our allocated business with zerotailpipeemission vehicles as a performance indicator. Clearly allocated sales are recorded. In terms of vehicles these include sales of tires displays sensors electronic control units artificial leather and hoses for emissionfree passenger cars and trucks as well as air springs for emissionfree trains and trams. ,,,0.3937660647059267,0.3680047831118047,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
309,In fiscal Continental reported the performance indicator of allocated lowcarbon business beyond business with zerotailpipeemission vehicles. The highest share of this indicator was accounted for by the replacement business with highly efficient tires with low rolling resistance. In view of the ongoing uncertainty about how tires and various industrial businesses can be classified as lowcarbon business under the various regulations e.g. EU Taxonomy Continental decided to discontinue reporting on allocated lowcarbon business beyond business with zerotailpipeemission vehicles in fiscal and to develop a new reporting approach going forward. Results of the concept In fiscal the allocated business with zerotailpipeemission vehicles amounted to million PY million. The yearonyear growth is attributable in particular to the growing market success of electric mobility since Continentals products can now be found in many massproduced models. ,,0.36877118890538485,0.3641135476827112,0.33151056464700046,,,0.41084411711236474,0.38443344839008303,,,,,,,,,,,

314,Our ambition As set out in our sustainability ambition we strive for closed resource and product cycles by at the latest together with our partners along the value chain. Of central importance for our ambition are the requirements and speed of transformation of our customers industries and markets as well as the resulting transformation opportunities and risks. Concept The switch to a circular economy is a profound and complex transformation process for Continental which at the same time is highly relevant for the achievement of other topic areas of the companys sustainability ambition. The group sectors are responsible for implementing circularity in particular with respect to product design business models material use and material procurement. They have each started to design andor implement specific initiatives and projects that are aimed at improving the use of productrelated technological and biological cycles. In addition work is continuously being done on the durability recyclability and adaptability of products. To cite some examples ,,,0.4479051221886621,,0.3370250575867426,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

324,Our ambition As set out in our sustainability ambition we strive for responsible sourcing and business partnerships by at the latest together with our partners along the value chain. Our understanding of a responsible value chain thus refers to our supply chain and customer relationships and to our own locations. Of central importance for our ambition are the requirements and speed of transformation of our customers industries and markets as well as the resulting transformation opportunities and risks. ConceptContinental operates in complex global value chains that are exposed to a variety of risks associated with the violation of protected rights. Risks within this context are always related to the potential negative impact on people and the environment. Continental has therefore established a comprehensive management system for ensuring its due diligence obligations in order to identify risks in connection with defined protected rights within its supply chain and in its own business units. For this purpose responsibilities rules and processes have been clearly defined for this purpose including riskmitigation measures and control mechanisms. The responsible value chain due diligence system RVCDDS focuses on the protected rights defined by us and will be developed further in line with the development of dynamic economic social and environmental requirements. The RVCDDS applies to ContinentalAG and to all subsidiaries in which the Continental Group exercises a controlling influence. The Executive Board of ContinentalAG is updated on the current status by the Continental Groups human rights officer at least once a year and decides on the systems effectiveness appropriateness and potential for improvement. It then proposes any suitable improvements to the RVCDDS where necessary either to the system as a whole or to selected elements. The RVCDDS is additionally integrated into Continentals overarching internal control system risk management system and compliance management system. As a key prevention measure at corporate level Continental has adopted responsible value chain commitments RVC commitments that are accessible online at www.continentalsustainability.com. These commitments address the defined risk categories and formulate what is expected of the companys own business units and employees as well as of its direct suppliers. The RVC commitments surpass the minimum legal requirements especially when it comes to working conditions. On top of this Continental has anchored further prevention measures in its own business units and with respect to direct suppliers. Within the RVCDDS our Code of Conduct defines the fundamental requirements for our employees while the Business Partner Code of Conduct defines the fundamental requirements among others for our suppliers as well as their suppliers with regard to human rights working conditions environmental protection conflict minerals and anticorruption. The Business Partner Code of Conduct is updated regularly most recently in fiscal to reflect changes or adjustments to relevant legislation. For suppliers of natural rubber our sourcing policy for sustainable natural rubber additionally applies. The existing corporatewide whistleblower system within ContinentalAG the Continental Integrity Hotline was expanded as part of the legal requirements under the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz and is available both to employees within the Continental Group as well as persons outside the company. The Integrity Hotline is open for information on potential violations of human rights and environmental rights among other issues. Alongside the whistleblower system a range of other resources are used to investigate potential protected right violations and implement preventive and remedial measures where necessary. The RVCDDS additionally defines the framework for taking remedial measures within the companys own business units as well as toward direct suppliers and should the situation arise also toward indirect suppliers. Sustainability aspects are also taken into consideration at various other points in supplier management. For example selected suppliers are evaluated based on various criteria using selfassessment questionnaires which we collect via the generally accepted sustainability platforms for our industries such as EcoVadis and NQC. These questionnaires are reviewed annually at the corporate level. Selective local audits or other audit activities are also carried out for example in relation to the existence of management systems. We also continue to develop our approach for the responsible value chain in dialogue with external stakeholders and support the development of industrywide standards for example through our participation in industry dialogue with the German government on human rights in the automotive industry. Here we have worked in particular to cultivate a shared understanding of industry risks and due diligence requirements. We are also involved in initiatives and associations such as econsense the Responsible Business Alliance RBA and the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber GPSNR. ,0.2815224986957275,,0.4171238480832587,0.31065716134209587,0.33865102833813154,,0.4380496972628776,,,,,,,,,,,,
325,Responsible sourcing is the responsibility of the relevant purchasing organizations which are established at Continental by group sector product group and country for example. A corporate purchasing network regularly deals with responsible sourcing topics as well. The Group Quality group function coordinates the management of conflict minerals including the corresponding reporting processes. Results of the concept The completed risk analysis was used to formally prioritize the risk categories of harmful environmental impacts equal treatmentantidiscrimination and working conditions including working time for the companys own business units as well as all risk categories for the supply chain as they pertain to direct suppliers. As part of the RVCDDS rollout training on the RVC commitments and on the RVCDDS itself was provided to employees worldwide in particular to staff in management positions and to those performing special functions. To further increase transparency and sustainability in Continentals natural rubber supply chain the activities of the joint venture Rubberway which was founded in were rolled out further for the digital risk analysis of the upstream supply chain. The joint project with the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GIZ in the Indonesian province of West Kalimantan which has been in place since was also further expanded. The aim of the project is to jointly drive forward the implementation of a digital system for the traceability of natural rubber from the project region. Optimizing the supply chain and offering training in the sustainable farming of natural rubber helps smallholders to increase the quantity quality and yield of their produce thus improving their income. In addition a cultivation strategy designed around sustainability prevents clearing and deforestation thereby conserving valuable resources. As part of a development project with Security Matters SMX Continental is working on testing a tamperproof means of verification of the geographical origin of natural rubber using marker technologies. In field testing was successfully completed and the marker substance could be verified beyond doubt throughout the entire tire production process. As at December valid supplier selfassessment questionnaires were available via the two sustainability platforms EcoVadis and NQC PY . This corresponds to a completion rate of of suppliers selected for this process PY . The increase in the number of available valid supplier selfassessment questionnaires and the higher completion rate are due to the onboarding of ContiTech suppliers in EcoVadis and the followup activities with suppliers to update and renew their selfassessment questionnaires. ,,0.3803664631755336,0.35946068746153226,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

330,Our ambition As set out in our sustainability ambition we provide inspiring healthy and fair working conditions. Concept The Continental Groups Code of Conduct sets out the foundation for good working conditions as the basis of our global collaboration including respect for human rights and fair working conditions. Employees receive training on compliance with the Code of Conduct. The management system being rolled out for a responsible value chain also includes the companys own activities see the Responsible Value Chain section. Our HR strategy is geared toward meeting staffing requirements in terms of both quantity and quality. The two HR strategy initiatives Industrialize Best Fit and Enable Transformation are therefore focused on efficiently and effectively bringing together the right people and positions as well as shaping the digital and technological transformation and cultural shift toward new forms of collaboration. Workforce planning the search for diagnostic selection and development of talent in particular in the areas of software and IT the promotion of employee diversity and lifelong learning the further development of the management culture and the flexibilization of working hours are therefore essential action fields of strategic HR work. We are tackling the impact of our Transformation structural program and further measures introduced due to changing conditions with targeted training measures for the employees affected. New career prospects and employment opportunities are to be opened up on the internal as well as the external employment markets. The HR functions at Continental Group group sector business area and country level which work together in a global network are responsible for HR. A special network of country coordinators for labor relations is also part of this organization. We measure the success of HR work against the OUR BASICS Live Sustainable Engagement index which is calculated on the basis of the annual employee survey. The index measures employee agreement on topics such as whether they personally support the company values and whether they are proud to work for Continental. We also use sickness rate and unforced fluctuation rate as performance indicators.

Local management systems drive forward the implementation of these guidelines. The concrete organizational and technical requirements can be found in the relevant ESH management manuals for the group sectors. Many locations have additionally undergone external certification audits. The certified business activities are assessed annually to determine how many employees are covered by environmental management energy management and occupational safety and health management systems. The accident rate the number of accidents per million working hours is used as an effectiveness indicator for occupational safety and health management. The accident rate has also been part of the LTI plans for the members of the Executive Board and global managers since fiscal . Continental had set itself the goal of reducing the accident rate to . accidents per million working hours by . For more information see the remuneration report on our website under CompanyCorporate GovernanceExecutive Board. Group Environmental and Climate Protection and Group Safety and Health are responsible for the related strategic corporatewide ESH management process and are supplemented by corresponding functions in the individual group sectors. Local operational environment safety and health protection is the responsibility of the locations and is coordinated by local ESH managers in each case. Results of the concept As at December the majority of our employees throughout the Continental Group were covered by the management systems of the certified business activities. The environmental management system certification covered of employees unchanged from the previous year.

348,Our ambition As set out in our sustainability ambition we are recognized by our customers and society as being a benchmark in quality by ensuring safe and sustainable products. Concept The decisive factor in becoming a benchmark in quality is a qualityoriented company culture. Our quality policy sets out guidelines for product and process quality at Continental. Product recalls product liability claims and proceedings as a result of quality defects represent a business risk that we want to avoid due to the resulting losses of sales costs and loss of customer and market acceptance. For more information see the report on risks and opportunities in this annual report. Local management systems drive forward the implementation of these guidelines. The concrete organizational and technical requirements can be found in the relevant quality management manuals for the group sectors. The extent of the certifications is assessed on an annual basis as to how many employees they cover with respect to quality management systems. The number of new field quality events is used as an effectiveness indicator for our quality management. A field quality event is a riskminimizing measure for a product manufactured andor sold by Continental on the basis of a safetyrelated defect andor noncompliance with regulations that was initiated by Continental a customer andor an authority. The Group Quality Technical Compliance Continental Business System CBS and Environment group function as well as the quality functions at various levels in the Continental Group which work together in a global network are responsible for the strategic corporatewide quality management process. Results of the concept As at December certified quality management systems covered of our employees throughout the Continental Group PY .

354,Our ambition As set out in our sustainability ambition we implement effective management processes fair business practices and responsible corporate governance with a balanced view of different perspectives. Concept Group Compliance which is divided into a central team and regional functions is responsible for preventing violations in the areas of corruption antitrust law money laundering and data protection. This structure is supplemented by compliance coordinators in the countries and at the locations. The Compliance Manual sets out how the compliance management system is designed and implemented. Continental strives for a holistic and proactive compliance management system based on a comprehensive and predictive analysis of potential compliance risks followed by the implementation of appropriate policies and procedures training consulting monitoring and controls that lead to ongoing lessons learned and system improvements. The Integrity Hotline is the primary tool for support with detecting violations. When it comes to preventing violations in the area of technical compliance responsibility lies with the Group Quality Technical Compliance CBS and Environment group function together with the central functions for quality and technical compliance within the group sectors. The technical compliance policy as well as the technical compliance management system manual and other procedural standards set out how the compliance management system is designed and implemented. A network of supporting roles in the various functions within the group sectors business areas segments and sites is being devised and expanded on an ongoing basis in order to support the identification of risks and other technical compliance considerations. The appropriateness and effectiveness of the risk and compliance management systems are monitored and assessed as part of Continentals overarching internal control system. On top of this Integrity Perception is measured using a newly defined indicator. This new indicator was applied for the first time in . It is based on specific questions asked within the context of the annual OUR BASICS Live survey and expresses employees perception of key aspects involved in implementing our integrity ambition within the organization. It is therefore characterized by subjective impressions and estimates that reveal whether the systems are having the intended impact among employees. The indicator will constitute a component of variable remuneration for the members of the Executive Board senior executives and executives worldwide beginning in fiscal . The aim is to make not only immediate but also sustained improvements to the indicator going forward with the ultimate goal of enhancing perceived integrity. As a further cornerstone for sustainable management practice we are committed to promoting employee diversity which we understand as internationality a balanced gender ratio and a range of experiences and age categories. We have set ourselves the corporate target of increasing the share of female executives and senior executives to by and to up to by . We intend to achieve this in particular by using objective diagnosticsassisted appointment procedures by strengthening our inclusive culture by expanding womens networks and by holding diversity workshops and specific events. Gender diversity the share of female executives and senior executives has also been part of the LTI plans for the members of the Executive Board and global managers since fiscal .

For more information on compliance see the Main characteristics of the internal control system section in the report on risks and opportunities in this annual report. Results of the concept As at December Continental had increased its share of female executives and senior executives to . PY .. The increase in the representation of women at management level proves that our initiatives and measures to promote gender diversity are having an effect. The share excluding the USA amounted to .

366,Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems Publication of the Environmental Delegated Act under EU Taxonomy Regulation was accompanied by the introduction of amendments to the Climate Delegated Act comprising changes to the existing activities for the two climate objectives as well the inclusion of new economic activities for the two climate objectives. This affects among others the two economic activities of category . Manufacture of automotive and mobility components and category . Manufacture of rail rolling stock constituents. Furthermore the EU Commission made it explicit in Recital of Delegated Regulation amending Delegated Regulation that the activity of tire manufacturing because of its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector is a Taxonomyeligible activity that is currently to be allocated to category . Manufacture of other lowcarbon technologies. While the amendments to the Climate Delegated Act do clear up some existing ambiguities in terms of how the regulation is to be interpreted when it comes to the Taxonomy eligibility of Continentals economic activities reporting pursuant to the EU Taxonomy Regulation remains fraught with uncertainty for Continental. This is mainly because unclear wording continues to be used in the regulations and notes on determining Taxonomy eligibility and in particular Taxonomy alignment as well as the calculations for key performance indicators for turnover capital expenditure and operating expenditure as they pertain to the economic activities relevant for Continental. As a result these regulations and notes are still open to interpretation. From Continentals perspective there is also uncertainty about the interaction between the various regulations delegated acts and official answers to frequently asked questions. Furthermore the short implementation period granted by the delegated act published in means that many questions of interpretation related to implementation have not yet been conclusively clarified. In interpreting the regulation we also take into consideration the assessments of industry associations in the supplier and automotive industries the reporting practices of European suppliers for and unofficial assessments by various experts. ,0.4261403514482012,0.38720281770995596,0.50983482363462,,0.3608784579585764,,0.47644051115305774,,,,,,,,,,,,0.34645521092791814

368,As part of our sustainability ambition we strive for carbon neutrality and emissionfree mobility and industry by at the latest see also the sections on carbon neutrality and on emissionfree mobility and industry in this combined nonfinancial statement and thus for the expansion of clean and carbonneutral mobility. With this in mind we have introduced performance indicators at a corporate level as part of our sustainability scorecard with the aim of monitoring our progress. In the previous year we used this scorecard to classify the allocated business with emissionfree mobility and industry as the indicator that comprises all economic activities to be disclosed for Continental as Taxonomyeligible with respect to the environmental target of climate change mitigation in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation. It consisted of allocated business with zerotailpipeemission vehicles and allocated lowcarbon business beyond business with zerotailpipeemission vehicles. This business was therefore classified under category . Manufacture of other lowcarbon technologies of the Delegated Regulation for Climate Change Mitigation EU Annex I in the previous year since at the time no general regulations or specific upstream economic activities were provided for. The introduction of category . Manufacture of automotive and mobility components and category . Manufacture of rail rolling stock constituents coupled with the updated approach to the activity of tire manufacturing resulted in the reclassification of various Continental economic activities reported as Taxonomyeligible in the reporting year compared with as well as a significant increase in sales capital expenditure and operating expenditure. In the reporting year we allocated all economic activities involved in the manufacture of automotive and mobility systems and components for road vehicles with the exception of tires but also extending beyond components for zerotailpipeemission vehicles to category .. Continental is of the opinion that the manufacture of all components irrespective of the drive system is Taxonomyeligible for all vehicles belonging to the vehicle classes listed in the category. This classification is based on the fact that from Continentals perspective the activity designation does not entail any restrictions in terms of components for example in relation to function or drive system and the corresponding components parts and systems are intended for use in road vehicles. The unclearly defined qualification characteristic criterion of activity . essential contribution to environmental performance is in Continentals view part of the assessment of Taxonomy alignment and not Taxonomy eligibility. Alternative interpretations were examined but they were found to be unsuitable by Continental. ,,0.3956791548403619,0.4920144090305116,0.316079809765319,0.3571871043482913,,0.4235199025349018,0.38755762524741577,,,,,,,,,,,

370,We allocated all economic activities involved in the manufacture of rail rolling stock constituents to category .. This classification is based in particular on the fact that from Continentals perspective the reference to activity . does not impose any restrictions on components in relation to the function or drive system of rail vehicles for which the components are manufactured provided that the components and systems are necessary for the operation and functioning of rail vehicles. Furthermore the activity designation does not entail any restrictions on components for example in relation to function or drive system. In contrast to the previous year in the reporting year all activities involved in tire manufacturing were classified as Taxonomyeligible under category .. In Recital of Delegated Regulation amending Delegated Regulation the Commission made it clear that tire manufacturing has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector and can contribute to a more circular economy. Until specific technical assessment criteria are defined for this activity tire manufacturing shall remain a Taxonomyeligible activity under category . Manufacture of other lowcarbon technologies. It is Continentals opinion that this clarification for the purposes of Taxonomy eligibility refers to the manufacture of tires of all kinds without any restrictions in terms of specific properties label classes or drive system technologies. Based on this clarification Continental has amended its approach compared with the previous year and now allocates the manufacture of tires of all kinds without any restrictions in terms of specific properties label classes or drive system technologies to category .. Alternative interpretations were also examined here but they were found to be unsuitable by Continental particularly with regard to Recital . In addition various Continental industrial businesses will continue to be reported as Taxonomyeligible as they were in the previous year. In the reporting year these primarily comprised the manufacture of components for wind turbines and the manufacture of materials for industrial plant insulation. Continental still allocates these businesses to category . Manufacture of other lowcarbon technologies since the economic activities pursue substantial reductions and therefore make significant contributions to the expansion of renewable energies and energy saving for example through insulation in industrial plants. For these classifications as well Continental believes it is irrelevant which functions are fulfilled by the supplier technologies in the end products as long as the end product facilitates the goals set out in Art. of the Taxonomy Regulation. The activities mentioned are not identified as Taxonomyeligible under Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act climate change adaptation. All other economic activities of the Continental Group that are not included in the aforementioned economic activities have been classified as Taxonomynoneligible for the reporting year. Accordingly Continental currently has not allocated any economic activities to the other environmental objectives under Annex I Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources Annex II Transition to a circular economy Annex III Pollution prevention and control or Annex IV Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. We base the classification on the information publicly available at the time the report was prepared. Taxonomyeligible turnover The information on turnover is prepared in accordance with section.. of Annex to the Delegated Regulation on Disclosure Obligations and in compliance with IFRS accounting regulations see tables at the end of this nonfinancial statement. The method of determination selected by Continental ensures that double counting is avoided. The described firsttime classification of all tire manufacturing activities as Taxonomyeligible under category . and the firsttime classification of all other economic activities involved in the manufacture of automotive and mobility systems and components for road vehicles as Taxonomyeligible under category . resulted in a significant increase in Taxonomyeligible turnover in the reporting year. Added to this was the firsttime classification of other economic activities involved in the manufacture of rail rolling stock constituents as Taxonomyeligible under category .. In addition various Continental industrial businesses were reported as Taxonomyeligible under category . as they were in the previous year. A total sum of .billion was reported as Taxonomyeligible turnover in the reporting year PY .billion equivalent to . of total consolidated sales PY .. The breakdown of Taxonomyeligible turnover by category is shown in the table on page. Information on the Continental Groups total turnover the denominator of the key figure calculation can be found in the consolidated statement of income of this annual report under Sales. Taxonomyeligible capital expenditure and operating expenditure Taxonomyeligible capital expenditure and operating expenditure have been recorded in accordance with the Delegated Regulation on Disclosure Obligations and taking into account the clarifications made by the European Commission in October. The figures for Taxonomyeligible capital expenditure and operating expenditure under category a are allocations based on the proportion of Taxonomyeligible turnover. For reasons connected to the business model the equipment machinery and buildings of the Continental Group are thus used both for Taxonomyeligible activities and for other activities. This applies both to capital expenditure and operating expenditure for assets or processes associated with Taxonomyeligible activities category a. The allocation takes place at group sector level and not according to the individual locations in order to avoid double counting take into account internal business and consolidation effects and reflect the Continental Groups matrix structure. This allocation of turnover thus reflects the distribution of Continentals production. The Platform on Sustainable Finance also recommends such an approach to allocation in its report to the Commission dated October. This states for enabling activities that capital expenditure and operating expenditure should be reported on the basis of their proportion of turnover provided the activities are Taxonomyeligible and that they not do not include activities that are Taxonomynoneligible. ,0.37255182934177977,0.5069047923603096,0.6377078287374174,0.41779152625190336,0.429442596244472,0.43417420501361853,0.5450928402097495,0.49703611621288485,,0.30834845620798146,,,0.3060740148259581,0.3734088245827501,0.3439771913916736,0.2470444621831323,,0.21053035471213194,0.38437537086136003
371,The expanded interpretation of economic activities classified as Taxonomyeligible in the reporting year likewise led to a significant increase in Taxonomyeligible capital expenditure. A total sum of .million was reported as Taxonomyeligible capital expenditure in the reporting year PY .million equivalent to . of total capital expenditure PY .. The breakdown of Taxonomyeligible capital expenditure by category is shown in the table on page. The information on capital expenditure is prepared in accordance with section.. of Annex to the Delegated Regulation on Disclosure Obligations in compliance with IFRS accounting regulations. Information on the Continental Groups total capital expenditure can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the segment reporting Note of this annual report. The information refers to capital expenditure in the intangible assets Note property plant and equipment Note leases Note and investment property Note presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Operating expenditure is defined in accordance with section.. of Annex to the Delegated Regulation on Disclosure Obligations and has been calculated on an imputed basis as described above. For the denominator of the key figure calculation for operating expenditure Continental takes into account direct noncapitalized costs incurred in the reporting year as a result of research and development net building renovation measures shortterm leasing and maintenance and repairs. The expanded interpretation of economic activities classified as Taxonomyeligible in the reporting year likewise led to a significant increase in Taxonomyeligible operating expenditure. A total sum of .million was reported as Taxonomyeligible operating expenditure in the reporting year PY .million equivalent to . of total operating expenditure PY .. The breakdown of Taxonomyeligible operating expenditure by category is shown in the table on page. When determining the Taxonomyeligible capital expenditure and operating expenditure for reasons of materiality the decision was made to forgo separate reporting of investments in individual measures and the acquisition of products from Taxonomyeligible economic activities under category c as well as reporting of the resulting operating expenditure in the reporting year. Continental notes that from its perspective various interpretations with respect to the requirements concerning capital expenditure and operating expenditure particularly for category c and for operating expenditure more generally continue to result in uncertainty when determining Taxonomyrelated information. ,0.37114946267815757,0.4279523244986516,0.4383749873629116,0.38827998349053044,0.41403760960603414,0.4766421516792232,0.5183324900989191,0.44407928970202176,0.3853393803224932,0.38934484386323426,0.42949259622903446,0.3337547264327452,0.3330123229558057,0.4422646864199267,0.38369394930019796,0.3852896369607732,,0.23737857479008925,0.39929268396603074

373,As in the previous year Continental did not report any economic activities as being Taxonomyaligned. For all economic activities that are reported under category . specific comparative lifecycle assessments are required in order to also report these as being Taxonomyaligned. These must demonstrate substantial savings to lifecycle emissions compared with the highestperforming alternative technology or solution available on the market or the highestperforming alternative product available on the market. External verification of the lifecycle assessments must also take place in accordance with predefined standards. A simplified lifecycle consideration as called for by the Taxonomy Regulation itself is no longer sufficient in accordance with the Delegated Regulation for Climate Change Mitigation for category .. Continental did not have the corresponding lifecycle assessments at its disposal in the reporting year meaning it is currently not possible to allocate Taxonomyaligned economic activities. For this reason the Do No Significant Harm DNSH criteria and the minimum protection requirements along the value chain were not assessed according to specific economic activities. It was not yet mandatory in the reporting year to report Taxonomyaligned economic activities if the economic activities are reported according to the categories . and . which have been newly integrated into the Climate Delegated Act. Since Continental does not currently report any activities as Taxonomyaligned no Taxonomyaligned capital expenditure or operating expenditure according to categories a and b has been reported. Since no Taxonomyeligible capital expenditure or operating expenditure under category c was identified no Taxonomyaligned capital expenditure or operating expenditure under category c has been reported. ,0.329238120532701,0.3610781151853606,0.4794781635001496,0.36526667954833186,0.37137794016495174,0.3164713035947922,0.48447480588721487,,,,,,,0.3848198347437331,0.3382648924924005,,,,0.380098751638404

386,With a share of consolidated sales PY the automotive industry with the exception of the replacement business was Continentals most important customer group in fiscal . The Automotive group sector accounted for the lions share but the Tires and ContiTech group sectors also generated significant sales figures in this market segment. The secondbiggest market segment for Continental was the global replacementtire business for passenger cars and commercial vehicles with of total sales in fiscal PY . Because passenger cars and light commercial vehicles make up a considerably higher share of the replacementtire business their development is particularly important to our economic success. The thirdbiggest market segment for Continental was the global business with industrial customers and spare parts from the ContiTech group sector with around of total sales PY . Continentals biggest sales region in the reporting year was still Europe which accounted for of sales PY followed by North America at PY and AsiaPacific at PY . Development of new passengercar registrations In there was a significant rise in the number of newly registered cars in the major international automotive markets. The availability of many car models improved compared with the weak previous year. These positive developments more than offset the ongoing subdued demand resulting from geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties and high consumer prices. According to preliminary data from the German Association of the Automotive Industry Verband der Automobilindustrie VDA . million new vehicles were registered in the European car market EU EFTA and the United Kingdom in more than in the previous year. Passenger car sales rose by in Japan and by in the USA. Brazil recorded an increase of . In China the worlds largest car market the VDA registered record sales in . The number of newly registered vehicles rose by to .million units outperforming the overall Chinese economy which lost momentum as a whole. In India sales of new vehicles rose by to .million units in . According to preliminary data from car manufacturer Renault newcar registrations in also increased significantly yearonyear. Development of production of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles The stabilization of supply chains which were significantly disrupted in the previous year due to the war in Ukraine and the pandemicrelated lockdowns in China was the main reason for the substantial increase in the production of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles weighing less than metric tons in . Greater semiconductor capacity also contributed to the rise in production. The strike in the US automotive industry which lasted several weeks had no significant impact on the development of global vehicle production. According to preliminary data Europe recorded a rise in the production of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in the reporting year. North America and China increased their production by in . According to preliminary figures global production for rose by to .million units. ,,,,,,,0.403243737877875,,,,,,,,,,,,

388,Development of production of medium and heavy commercial vehicles The production of medium and heavy commercial vehicles weighing more than metric tons grew significantly yearonyear in our core European market in the reporting period thanks to stabilized supply chains. Production increased in Eastern and Central Europe in particular despite the ongoing war in Ukraine. The improved availability of materials and pentup demand also resulted in a significant increase in production in Western Europe. According to preliminary data overall production volumes rose by yearonyear. In our other core market of North America good economic growth and pentup demand led to an ongoing upturn in the production of medium and heavy commercial vehicles by according to preliminary figures. Development of replacementtire markets for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles In both Europe and North America demand for replacement tires initially declined in the year under review. The effects of inflation resulted in significant purchasing restraint among consumers in the first half of the year in particular and the levels of stock among dealers led to a reduced need for stockpiling. In North America a strong second half of the year compensated for the weak start while the replacementtire markets in Europe were down yearonyear overall. By contrast the Chinese market grew significantly. Sales volumes of replacement tires for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles weighing less than metric tons fell by in Europe excluding Russia for as a whole. In North America demand in the year under review was on a par with the previous year. Conversely sales volumes in China rose by . According to preliminary data global sales volumes of replacement tires for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles rose by in the reporting year. Development of replacementtire markets for medium and heavy commercial vehicles In our core markets of Europe excluding Russia and North America preliminary data indicates that yearonyear demand for replacement tires for medium and heavy commercial vehicles weighing more than metric tons fell by and respectively in . Development of industrial production In addition to vehicle production and the replacement business for the automotive industry the development of various other industries is crucial to the success of our ContiTech group sector. ContiTech products are used in particular in equipment machinery and vehicles for railway transport mining agriculture and other key industries. As well as the general development of gross domestic product the development of industrial production is therefore regarded as an important indicator for ContiTechs business with industrial customers. In the reporting period industrial production in the eurozone continued to be affected by increased costs and was down yearonyear as a whole. In the USA as well industrial production saw only a slight increase in remaining more or less constant yearonyear. China on the other hand recorded significant growth in industrial production compared with the previous year which was influenced by lockdowns and other factors. ,,,,,,,,0.34741126348078666,,,,,,,,,,,

390,Compared with previous years the development of raw materials markets in the year under review was largely stable due to an overall improvement in availability. Global supply chains also returned to more normal levels. This was also reflected in less volatile price developments particularly for metals. Although a decline in price volatility was observed for products such as crude oil and butadiene prices still fluctuated significantly in some cases. Overall however they were roughly on a par with the level seen at the start of at the end of the reporting period. Carbon steel and stainless steel are input materials for many of the mechanical components such as diecast parts integrated by Continental into its products. Steel wire is used in particular in tire production as steel cord but also in conveyor belts and timing belts to increase tensile strength. Aluminum is used in particular for diecast parts and stamped and bent components while copper is used in particular in electric motors mechatronic components and printed circuit boards.

The average price of aluminum in US dollars was down in . Precious metals such as silver and gold are used by Continental and by our suppliers to coat components. The average price of gold in US dollars was up in while that of silver was up . For natural rubber weak tire demand worldwide led to a decline in prices. The average price of natural rubber TSR in US dollars was down yearonyear in for example. Crude oil is the most important basic building block for syntheticrubber input materials such as butadiene and styrene as well as for carbon black various other chemicals and plastics. The price of crude oil stabilized noticeably in compared with the high volatility in the previous year. The annual average price of Brent crude oil in US dollars fell by yearonyear. ,,0.353857085195609,0.3672614459443701,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
395,The lower price of crude oil also led to price reductions for various input materials for synthetic rubber in . The average prices in US dollars for butadiene and styrene for example fell by and respectively. Plastic resins as technical thermoplastics are required by Continental and our suppliers in particular for the manufacture of housing parts in the Automotive group sector and for various other plastic parts in the ContiTech group sector. The average price of resins in US dollars was down in . Continental uses natural and synthetic rubber in large quantities for the manufacture of tires and industrial rubber products. It also uses relatively large quantities of carbon black as a filler material and of steel cord and nylon cord as structural materials. Due to the high volumes and direct purchasing of raw materials their price development has a significant influence on the earnings of the Tires and ContiTech group sectors. ,,0.3149205639226713,0.3725827969948238,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

437,Research and development Research and development expenses net increased by . million or . yearonyear to .million PY .million corresponding to . of sales PY .. In the Automotive group sector costs in connection with initial product development projects in the originalequipment business are capitalized. Costs are capitalized as at the time at which we are named as a supplier and have successfully achieved a specific prerelease stage. Capitalization ends with the approval for unlimited volume production. The costs of customerspecific applications preproduction prototypes and testing for products already being sold do not qualify as development expenditure that may be recognized as an intangible asset. Capitalized development expenses are amortized on a straightline basis over a useful life of three to seven years and recognized in the cost of sales. In the opinion of the Continental Group the assumed useful life reflects the period for which an economic benefit is likely to be derived from the corresponding development projects. Of the development costs incurred in including development expenses for internally developed software .million PY .million in the Automotive group sector qualified for recognition as an asset. As in the previous year the requirements for the capitalization of development activities were not met in the Tires ContiTech or Contract Manufacturing group sectors.

511,The governance systems at Continental comprise the internal control system ICS the risk management system RMS and as a subcomponent of these systems the compliance management system. The risk management system in turn also includes the early risk identification system in accordance with Section of the German Stock Corporation Act Aktiengesetz AktG. The Executive Board is responsible for the governance systems which include all subsidiaries. The Supervisory Board and its Audit Committee monitor the effectiveness of these systems. Main characteristics of the internal control system In order to operate successfully as a company in a complex business environment and to ensure the effectiveness efficiency and propriety of all processes and compliance with the relevant legal and sublegislative regulations Continental has established an internal control system that encompasses all relevant business processes. Certain aspects of sustainability are also considered and continuously further developed in compliance with the regulatory framework. The management and monitoring of the internal control system are currently being incorporated into a holistic ICS governance system. The Governance Risk and Compliance GRC Committee chaired by the Executive Board member responsible for Integrity and Law and the Executive Board member responsible for Finance Controlling and IT is responsible for monitoring the internal control system and the risk management system and as part of these systems the compliance management system. Key elements of the corporatewide internal control system are the clear allocation of responsibilities and systeminherent controls in the respective process flows. The twoperson rule and separation of functions are fundamental principles of this organization. Continentals management also issues guidelines to ensure that all business processes are conducted in an economical orderly and legally compliant manner. Guidelines specific to the Continental Group and to its individual group sectors are managed centrally in the House of Rules and are thus available to all Continental employees. Based on these fundamental principles and the globally applicable guidelines the internal control system at Continental follows the Three Lines Model. In the first line systeminherent controls are configured in the companys IT systems to support the orderly and economical execution of all process flow transactions in accordance with the corporatewide guidelines. At the same time these transactional controls help to identify risks and deviations that require separate consideration. As the controls and process flows established in the first line apply to Continentals operating business they are generally put in place at the level of our operating units such as our subsidiaries business areas and group sectors. In the second line of our internal control system guidelines for process flows are developed implemented and updated and compliance with controls and guidelines is monitored. Responsibility for this lies primarily with the group functions in addition to the business areas and group sectors. The responsibilities include for example the risk management system and the compliance management system. In order to perform this supervisory and monitoring function an integrated reporting system has been established that includes for example the financial reporting internal control system Financial Reporting ICS the general risk management system the compliance risk management system and the tax compliance management system. The supervisory and monitoring function is performed on the basis of regular reports and supplemented as needed with effectiveness tests as part of selfaudits and regular internal and external reviews. The compliance management system plays an important role within the second line of defense by helping to prevent detect and respond to compliance violations. The Group Compliance group function is responsible for the compliance management system. ,,0.31151748185557715,,0.35089231681905453,,,,,,0.30472258827586596,,,,,,,,,

513,The chief compliance officer reports directly to the Executive Board member responsible for Integrity and Law. The work done by Group Compliance focuses mainly on preventing and detecting corruption fraud and other property offenses violations of antitrust and competition law and money laundering implementing data protection and responding to compliance violations. For other legal areas in which there is a risk of compliance violations such as taxes customs sanctions and export controls and qualitytechnical compliance responsibility for appropriate and effective compliance management lies with the respective functions which are supported in these tasks by Group Compliance. An effective culture of compliance is the basis for prevention. It begins with setting an appropriate tone from the top by the Executive Board and management and in addition to risk analysis includes in particular employee training compliance consulting and the internal publication of guidelines. In the course of risk analysis the business activities of Continental are examined for compliance risks within the scope of topdown as well as bottomup review processes. The risk of compliance violations arises primarily from organizational structures and workflows the given market situation activities in certain geographical regions inappropriate incentive systems conflicts of interest and criminal intent on the part of individual employees. Furthermore findings from investigations by the Group Internal Audit group function as well as discussions with management and employees at all hierarchical levels are taken into account. This risk analysis is not a oneoff procedure but is performed annually and continuously updated. Prevention is also fostered by consultation on specific matters with Group Compliance and by the internal publication of guidelines on topics such as anticorruption including giving and receiving gifts as well as donations and sponsoring antitrust and competition law antimoney laundering and data protection. In training events Group Compliance addresses topics directly related to everyday compliance issues and challenges. Continental introduced the Business Partner Code of Conduct to prevent compliance violations by suppliers service providers representatives or similar third parties. This must be recognized as a basic requirement for doing business with Continental. In the context of detection Continental has set up an Integrity Hotline to give employees and third parties outside the Continental Group the opportunity to report violations of legal regulations its fundamental values and ethical standards. Information on any kind of potential violations including accounting manipulation can be reported anonymously via this hotline. The hotline is available worldwide in many different languages. The companys investigating units rigorously pursue any and all substantiated leads. Detection also includes the support of regular and incidentrelated audits conducted by Group Internal Audit. Compliancerelated issues are regularly the subject of audits by Group Internal Audit. Responses are aimed at implementing measures as a consequence of identified compliance violations. Group Compliance is involved in decisionmaking on measures that may be required including thorough analysis to ensure that isolated incidents are not symptoms of failings in the system. In this way corresponding gaps can be closed preventively and the compliance management system as well as the internal control system can be systematically developed. When it comes to preventing violations in the area of technical compliance responsibility lies with the Group Quality Technical Compliance CBS and Environment group function supported by the central functions within the group sectors. The technical compliance policy as well as the technical compliance management system manual and other procedural standards set out how the compliance management system is designed and implemented. A network of supporting roles in the various functions within the group sectors business areas segments and sites is being devised and expanded on an ongoing basis in order to support the identification of risks and other technical compliance considerations. The third line of our internal control system is our Group Internal Audit group function. Group Internal Audit serves an independent and objective auditing and advisory function applying a systematic approach to help review assess and improve the adequacy and effectiveness of the organizations governance systems. Continentals Executive Board authorizes Group Internal Audit to conduct audits in all regions companies or functions of ContinentalAG and its affiliated fully consolidated subsidiaries worldwide. Group Internal Audit prepares an annual riskoriented audit plan that is submitted to Continentals Executive Board for review and approval. In addition to its planned general audits Group Internal Audit also conducts special investigations. These are based on tips and information about fraudulent acts received from internal or external sources such as the Integrity Hotline or the ombudsmans office. Group Internal Audit regularly reports its audit and investigation results to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee. Significant risks and potential improvements to internal controls are presented as part of the reporting to the aforementioned bodies. The implementation by management of the measures recommended in the course of audits is also monitored by Group Internal Audit and reported to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee. ,,,,,,,0.4128523674239891,,,0.2921055018211551,,,,,0.31578840883253184,,,,
514,Main characteristics of the internal control and risk management system with respect to the accounting process Sections and of the German Commercial Code Handelsgesetzbuch HGB Pursuant to Sections and HGB the main characteristics of the internal control and risk management system with respect to the accounting process must be described. All parts of the risk management system and internal control system that could have a material effect on the annual and consolidated financial statements must be included in the reporting. The consolidated financial statements of ContinentalAG are prepared on the basis of standard reporting by the subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS. Reporting is performed in compliance with IFRS and with the accounting manual applicable throughout the Continental Group. The consolidation of subsidiaries debt income and expenses and intercompany profits is performed at corporate level. The effectiveness of the financial reporting internal control system Financial Reporting ICS is evaluated in major areas by carrying out effectiveness tests in the reporting units on a quarterly basis. In addition Group Internal Audit reviews the efficiency and effectiveness of control processes as well as compliance with internal and external requirements. If any weaknesses are identified the Continental Groups management initiates the necessary measures. Main characteristics of the risk management system In the GRC policy adopted by the Executive Board Continental defines the general conditions for integrated GRC as a key element of the risk management system that regulates the identification assessment reporting and documentation of risks. In addition this also further increases corporatewide risk awareness and establishes the framework for a uniform risk culture. The GRC system incorporates all components of risk reporting and the examination of the effectiveness of the Financial Reporting ICS. Risks are identified assessed and reported at the organizational level that is also responsible for managing the identified risks. A multistage assessment process is used to involve also the higherlevel organizational units. The GRC system thus includes all reporting levels from the company level to the top corporate level. At the corporate level the responsibilities of the GRC Committee include identifying material risks for the Continental Group based on a multistage reporting process as well as complying with and implementing the GRC policy. The GRC Committee regularly informs the Executive Board and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of the material risks any weaknesses in the control system and measures taken. Moreover the auditor is required to report to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board regarding any material weaknesses in the Financial Reporting ICS which they have identified as part of their audit activities. A period under consideration of one year is always applied when evaluating risks and opportunities. Risks and their effects are assessed using an endtoend gross and net assessment methodology that helps to identify the impact of risk mitigation measures. Risks are assessed primarily according to quantitative criteria in various categories. If a risk cannot be assessed quantitatively then it is assessed qualitatively based on the potential negative effects its occurrence would have on achieving corporate goals and based on other qualitative criteria such as the impact on Continentals reputation. Risks and opportunities are not offset. Material individual risks for the Continental Group are identified from all the reported risks based on the probability of occurrence and the potential amount of damage that would be caused in the period under consideration. Quantified risks are based on EBIT effect and free cash flow effect. The individual risks that Continental has classified as material and the aggregated risks that have been assigned to risk categories are all described in the report on risks and opportunities provided the potential negative effect of an individual risk or the sum of risks included in a category exceeds million in the period under consideration or there is a significant negative impact on the corporate goals. The risk inventory aggregated using a Monte Carlo simulation is compared with the riskbearing capacity determined on the reporting date taking into account possible interactions and quantitative assumptions on qualitatively assessed risks and is supplemented by a qualitative assessment by the GRC Committee on overarching nonquantifiable risks in order to derive a statement on the potential risk to the Continental Group. ,,0.3142954974751161,,0.3394126523510059,,,,,,0.3096767445297653,,,,,,,,,
515,Local management can utilize various instruments for risk assessment such as predefined risk categories e.g. exchangerate risks productliability risks legal risks and assessment criteria centrally developed functionspecific questionnaires as well as the Financial Reporting ICSs process and control descriptions. The key controls in business processes purchase to pay order to cash asset management HR IT authorizations the financial statement closing process and sustainability reporting are thus tested with respect to their effectiveness. All major subsidiaries carry out a semiannual assessment of businessrelated risks and an annual assessment of compliance risks in the GRC systems ITaided risk management application. Any quality legal and compliance cases that have actually occurred are also taken into account when assessing these risks. The GRC system likewise encompasses the tax compliance management system the customs compliance management system and the export control compliance management system in order to ensure standard and regular review and reporting of pertinent risks. The quarterly Financial Reporting ICS completes regular GRC reporting. In the reporting year Continental redesigned its process for identifying and reporting strategic risks and began implementing these procedures in the established GRC process.Any new material risks arising ad hoc between regular reporting dates have to be reported immediately and considered by the GRC Committee. These also include risks identified in the audits performed by group functions. In addition to the risk analyses carried out by the reporting units as part of integrated GRC audits are also performed by Group Internal Audit. Furthermore the various controlling functions analyze the key figures provided as part of this reporting process at corporate and groupsector level in order to assess the effects of potential risks. For each risk identified the responsible management team initiates appropriate countermeasures which for material risks are also documented in the GRC system. The GRC Committee monitors and consolidates the material risks and suitable countermeasures at the corporate level. It regularly reports to the Executive Board and recommends further measures if needed. The Executive Board discusses and resolves the measures and reports to the Supervisory Boards Audit Committee. The responsible bodies continually monitor the development of all identified risks and the progress of actions initiated. Group Internal Audit regularly audits the risk management process thereby continually monitoring its effectiveness and further development. ,,0.34017745352422063,,,0.3438459759752721,,,,,0.28864670224781946,,,,,,,,,
516,Appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control and risk management system The Executive Board based its assessment of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control and risk management system on the findings from routine internal reporting but in particular also on functionspecific statements on the internal control and risk management system as well as an assessment of these by Group Internal Audit which were consolidated into an overall statement by the GRC Committee. These statements together with the overall statement by the GRC Committee are intended to offer an overview of key activities and controls that have been implemented summarize measures for reviewing appropriateness and effectiveness and indicate critical weaknesses in the control system as well as any related improvement measures. The functionspecific statements collected on the basis of a riskoriented selection process included various aspects in accordance with the implemented Three Lines model. In the first line documented processes and controls were checked with respect to whether these were in place and had been implemented as was any communication relating to these elements. Responsibility for guidelines and process flows lies in particular with the second line which within the scope of the review of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control and risk management system including the compliance management system is generally also satisfied with respect to the status of implementation of the regulations based on random checks as well as the processing of external supporting documentation such as certification in line with the International Organization for Standardization ISO the Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange TISAX and the International Automotive Task Force IATF. These not only reinforce compliance with regulatory provisions but also underscore the appropriate and effective operation of systems implemented at Continental in accordance with industry standards. Monitoring the internal control system and risk management system is one of the core tasks of Group Internal Audit the third line. As part of its audits Group Internal Audit assesses the implementation of riskcontrol measures and internal controls conducted with the help of recognized standards and methods. Deviations and weaknesses noted are summarized in a report for the relevant persons responsible and any improvement measures initiated. Significant risks and potential improvements to internal controls are presented as part of the reporting to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee. The implementation by management of the measures recommended in the course of audits is also monitored by Group Internal Audit and reported to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee. The internal control and risk management system including the compliance management system of ContinentalAG is undergoing a continuous process of improvement in order to expand existing processes and controls and meet new regulatory challenges. Currently this mainly includes implementing a technical compliance management system and improving IT governance and data compliance. In addition the global reorganization of the customs and export control functions is currently being driven forward and transferred to a comprehensive compliance management system. In a crossdomain project work is also being done on a reinforced integrative approach and expansion of the governance functions. Based on the statements from the respective functional areas the assessment of these by Group Internal Audit and the consolidated overall statement by the GRC Committee no matters have come to the Executive Boards attention that would suggest that the internal control and risk management system including the compliance management system was inappropriate or ineffective in all material respects in fiscal . Nevertheless there are inherent limitations to any internal control or risk management system including the compliance management system. Even a system considered appropriate and effective does not offer any guarantee that all risks or violations that have actually occurred will be uncovered in advance or that any process disruptions can be entirely ruled out. Opportunity management As part of our opportunity management activities we assess market and economic analyses and changes in legal requirements e.g. with regard to fuel consumption and emission standards as well as safety regulations. In addition we deal with the corresponding effects on the sectors and markets relevant to us our production factors and the composition and further development of our product portfolio. ,,0.33626164154534066,,0.31522133749956344,,0.31555150462181464,,,,,,,0.30956460281199993,,,0.2584884525539198,,,
518,The order of the risk categories and individual risks presented within the four risk groups reflects the current assessment of the relative risk exposure for Continental and thus provides an indication of the current significance of these risks. If no quantitative information on the amount of damage is provided the assessment is carried out on the basis of qualitative criteria. Unless the emphasis is placed on a specific group sector the risks apply to all group sectors. ,,0.3159538868633502,,0.3538943384003657,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

521,monitored provided this information is available. In addition Continental sets investment limits for each bank and trading limits for derivative instruments. The amount of these limits is based on the creditworthiness of the respective bank. Compliance with these limits is continuously monitored. Within the internally defined risk groups the cash and cash equivalents interestbearing investments and positive net fair values of derivative instruments held at banks assigned to a higher risk group range from million to million. ,,,,,,,,,,,0.4823443370947916,,,,,,,,
527,Continental is exposed to risks in connection with its pension commitments. Continental provides defined benefit pension plans in Germany the USA the UK and certain other countries. As at December the pension obligations amounted to .million. These existing obligations are financed predominantly through externally invested pension plan assets. In Continental established legally independent trust funds under contractual trust arrangements CTAs for the funding of pension obligations of certain subsidiaries in Germany. In Continental assumed additional CTAs in connection with the acquisition of Siemens VDO. As at December Continentals net pension obligations defined benefit obligations less the fair value of plan assets amounted to .million. Continentals externally invested plan assets are funded by externally managed funds and insurance companies. While Continental generally prescribes the investment strategies applied by these funds and takes these into account when selecting external fund managers it does not have any influence over their individual investment decisions. The assets are invested in different asset classes including equity fixedincome securities real estate and other investment vehicles. The values attributable to the externally invested plan assets are subject to fluctuations in the capital markets that are beyond Continentals influence. Unfavorable developments in the capital markets could result in a substantial coverage shortfall for these pension obligations resulting in a significant increase in Continentals net pension obligations. Any such increase in Continentals net pension obligations could adversely affect Continentals financial condition due to an increased additional outflow of funds to finance the pension obligations. Also Continental is exposed to risks associated with longevity and interestrate changes in connection with its pension commitments as an interestrate decrease could have an adverse effect on Continentals liabilities under these pension plans. Furthermore certain USbased subsidiaries of Continental have entered into obligations to make contributions to healthcare costs of former employees and retirees. Accordingly Continental is exposed to the potential risk that these costs may increase in the future. If the discount rates used to calculate net pension obligations were to decrease by . percentage points at the end of the year all other things being equal this would lead to a rise in net pension obligations of anywhere from million to million which could not be reduced by taking measures to minimize risk. However this would not affect EBIT. Continental is exposed to risks associated with warranty and product liability claims. In its quality strategy Continental has defined the framework conditions for all qualityrelated activities and ascribes the highest priority to quality. However Continental is constantly subject to product liability claims and proceedings alleging violations of due care violation of warranty obligations or material defects and claims arising from breaches of contract due to recalls or government proceedings. Any such lawsuits proceedings and other claims could result in increased costs for Continental. Moreover defective products could result in loss of sales and loss of customer and market acceptance. Such risks are insured up to levels considered economically reasonable by Continental but its insurance coverage could prove insufficient in individual cases. Additionally any defect in one of Continentals products in particular tires and other safetyrelated products could also have a considerable adverse effect on the companys reputation and market perception. This could in turn have a negative impact on Continentals sales and income. Moreover vehicle manufacturers are increasingly requiring a contribution from their suppliers for potential product liability warranty and recall claims. In addition Continental is subject to continuing efforts by its customers to change contract terms and conditions concerning the contribution to warranty and recall cost. Furthermore Continental manufactures many products pursuant to OEM customer specifications and quality requirements. If the products manufactured and delivered by Continental do not meet the requirements stipulated by its OEM customers at the agreed date of delivery production of the relevant products is generally discontinued until the cause of the product defect has been identified and remedied. Under certain circumstances this could lead to losses of sales and earnings. Furthermore Continentals OEM customers could potentially claim damages even if the cause of the defect is remedied at a later point in time. Moreover failure to fulfill quality requirements could have an adverse effect on the market acceptance of Continentals other products and its market reputation in various market segments. The quantifiable risks from warranty and product liability claims as at December taking into account provisions amounted to around million. Continental is exposed to risks from trade restrictions sanctions and export controls. Due to the global alignment of the economic activity of the Continental Group there are business risks with respect to embargoes sanctions and export controls. As a global company Continental also has business relations with customers and partners based in countries that are or may be in the future subject to export restrictions embargoes economic sanctions or other forms of trade restrictions. In addition to the fundamental influence that such restrictions have on the business activity of the Continental Group violations of relevant provisions may lead to considerable penalties administrative sanctions damage to the companys reputation as well as claims for damages. Continental may also be forced through new trade restrictions to limit or put an end to business activity in certain countries or regions. ,,,,,,,,,,,0.42961415292292143,,,,,,,,

532,There is a risk that Continental could infringe on the industrial property rights of third parties. There is a risk that Continental could infringe on the industrial property rights of third parties since its competitors suppliers and customers also submit a large number of inventions for industrial property protection. It is not always possible to determine with certainty whether there are effective and enforceable thirdparty industrial property rights to certain processes methods or applications. Therefore third parties could assert claims including illegitimate ones of alleged infringements of industrial property rights against Continental. As a result Continental could be required to cease manufacturing using or marketing the relevant technologies or products in certain countries or be forced to make changes to manufacturing processes andor products. In addition Continental could be liable to pay compensation for infringements or could be forced to purchase licenses to continue using technology from third parties. Continental for example supplies telecommunication modules that transmit vehicle data enable voice and internet functionality and are compatible with cellular communication standards. In this respect there is a risk that Continental or its suppliers may be denied their own direct license to use patents relating to these standards standard essential patents especially in the field of telecommunications standards such as G G or G and that Continental may become dependent on licenses and the conditions under which they are granted to customers. In addition Continental is subject to efforts by its customers to change contract terms and conditions concerning the participation in disputes regarding alleged infringements of intellectual property rights. Continental has formed provisions to cover the risks in this regard. In accordance with IAS . and GAS . no further disclosures will be made so as not to adversely affect the companys interests. Continental could become subject to additional burdensome environmental or safety regulations and new regulations could adversely affect demand for the companys products and services. As a corporation that operates worldwide Continental must observe a large number of different regulatory systems in numerous countries that change frequently and are continuously evolving and becoming more stringent particularly with respect to the environment chemicals and hazardous materials as well as health regulations. This also applies to air water and soil pollution regulations and to waste legislation all of which have recently become more stringent through new laws particularly in the European Union and the USA. Continental could be affected in particular by greater restrictions on the use of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances PFAS. Moreover Continentals locations and operations necessitate various permits and the requirements specified therein must be complied with. In the past adjusting to new requirements has necessitated investments and Continental assumes that further investments in this regard will be required in the future. Continental is exposed to risks from legal disputes. Companies from the Continental Group are involved in a number of legal and arbitration proceedings and could become involved in other such proceedings in the future. These proceedings could involve substantial claims for damages or payments particularly in the USA. For more information on legal disputes see Note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Continental could be unsuccessful in adequately protecting its intellectual property and technical expertise. Continentals products and services are highly dependent upon its technological knowhow and the scope and limitations of its proprietary rights therein. Continental has obtained or applied for a large number of patents and other industrial property rights that are of considerable importance to its business. The process of obtaining patent protection can be lengthy and expensive. Furthermore patents may not be granted on currently pending or future applications or may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide Continental with meaningful protection or commercial advantage. In addition although there is a presumption that patents are valid this does not necessarily mean that the patent concerned is effective or that possible patent claims can be enforced to the degree necessary or desired. A major part of Continentals knowhow and trade secrets is not patented or cannot be protected through industrial property rights. Consequently there is a risk that certain parts of Continentals knowhow and trade secrets could be transferred to collaboration partners customers and suppliers including Continentals machinery suppliers or plant vendors. This poses a risk that competitors will copy Continentals knowhow without incurring any expenses of their own. Moreover Continental has concluded a number of license crosslicense collaboration and development agreements with its customers competitors and other third parties under which Continental is granted rights to industrial property andor knowhow of such third parties. It is possible that license agreements could be terminated under certain circumstances in the event of the licensing partners insolvency or bankruptcy andor in the event of a change of control in either party leaving Continental with reduced access to intellectual property rights to commercialize its own technologies. ,,,,0.35949690584657285,,,,0.3470681407744107,,0.34864299920679903,,,,,,,,,

536,Digitalization and sustainability in the industrial business present Continental with opportunities. The growth potential results primarily from the increasing demand for sustainable as well as digital and intelligent solutions in the industrial business. In this regard the ContiTech group sector draws on its longstanding and detailed knowledge of the industry and materials to open up new business opportunities. Various materials are thus combined with electronic components and individual services. Continental also shows for example how future mobile interiors might look e.g. SPACE D design concept see the Research and Development section. If these new products become established more quickly than planned this would create corresponding sales and earnings opportunities for Continental. There are opportunities for Continental from changes in the legal framework. Legal regulations with the aim of further improving traffic safety provide an opportunity for a rise in demand for Continentals products. Based on our broad product portfolio for active vehicle safety we have developed more advanced safety systems over the past years. Further volume growth is expected as a result of more stringent requirements in various regional safety tests since an increasing number of safety systems have been recognized as having achieved the very highest level of safety. In addition more and more legal requirements in individual countries are being expanded to include active safety systems.,,,0.39806929855217243,,,0.3086692400935486,,,,,,,0.3649998130877337,,,,,,

In total orders amounting to around billion were acquired in fiscal PY billion. This figure includes expected sales over the entire duration of the delivery known as lifetime sales. These are based primarily on assumptions regarding production volumes of the respective vehicle or engine platforms the expected and agreed cost adjustments and the development of key raw material prices. The replacementtire business accounts for a large portion of the Tires group sectors sales which is why it is not possible to calculate a reliable figure for order volumes. The same applies to the ContiTech group sector which has business areas operating in various markets and industrial sectors each in turn with their own relevant factors. Consolidating the order figures from the various business areas of the ContiTech group sector would thus be meaningful only to a limited extent. Outlook for fiscal As mentioned on page of the report on expected developments we expect the global production of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in to be roughly on a par with the previous year with a negative development expected in our core market of Europe. This outlook takes into account the current tense geopolitical situation and its expected impact on production volumes in . Higher costs for wages and salaries amounting to around . billion are expected to weigh heavily on our earnings position in fiscal with around half of these costs attributable to the Automotive group sector.

606,the nonfinancial statement included in the Sustainability and Combined NonFinancial Statement section of the consolidated management report is prepared in all material respects in accordance with the applicable German legal and European requirements as well as with the specifying criteria disclosed by the Companys executive directors. Pursuant to Section Sentence HGB we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the consolidated management report. Basis for the audit opinions We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the consolidated management report in accordance with Section HGB and the EU Audit Regulation No. referred to subsequently as EU Audit Regulation in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer IDW. Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the consolidated management report section of our auditors report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition in accordance with Article f of the EU Audit Regulation we declare that we have not provided nonaudit services prohibited under Article of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements on the consolidated management report and on the nonfinancial statement included in the consolidated management report. Key audit matters in the audit of the consolidated financial statements Key audit matters are those matters that in our professional judgment were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from January to December . These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our audit opinion thereon we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters. In our view the matters of most significance in our audit were as follows ,,,,,0.36369769832533627,,,,,,,,,,0.3058005379089264,,,,
614,Goodwill amounting in total to . million . of total assets or . of total equity and noncurrent assets with finite useful lives amounting in total to . million . of total assets or . of total equity are reported in the Companys consolidated financial statements. While goodwill must be tested for impairment once a year or when there are indications of impairment noncurrent assets with finite useful lives only have to be tested for impairment if there are indications that they may be impaired triggering events. The impairment test is performed at the level of the cashgenerating units. The carrying amount of the relevant cashgenerating units where applicable including goodwill is compared with the corresponding recoverable amount in the context of the impairment test. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. The Company generally determines the recoverable amount using the value in use. The present value of the future cash flows from the respective cashgenerating units normally serves as the basis of valuation. Present values are calculated using discounted cash flow models. For this purpose the longterm planning for the cashgenerating units adopted by the executive directors forms the starting point which is extrapolated based on assumptions about longterm rates of growth. Expectations relating to future market developments and assumptions about the development of macroeconomic factors which are currently subject to increased uncertainties are also taken into account. The discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital for the respective cashgenerating unit. If the value in use falls below the carrying amount of the cashgenerating unit it is assessed whether the fair values less costs of disposal of the assets exceed their carrying amounts. If not the need for writedowns shall be based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. The impairment test determined that no writedowns were necessary. The outcome of this valuation is dependent to a large extent on the estimates made by the executive directors with respect to the future cash flows from the respective cashgenerating units the discount rate used the rate of growth and other assumptions and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Against this background and due to the complex nature of the valuation this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit. ,,,,,0.3499743519480147,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

688,In accordance with the provisions of IFRS Operating Segments Continental AGs segment reporting is based on the management approach with regard to segment identification under which information regularly provided to the chief operating decisionmaker for decisionmaking purposes is considered decisive. The activities of the Continental Group are divided into the following segments Automotive offers technologies for safety brake chassis motion and motioncontrol systems. Its portfolio also includes innovative solutions for assisted and automated driving display and operating technologies audio and camera solutions for the vehicle interior as well as intelligent information and communication technology associated with the mobility services of fleet operators and commercial vehicle manufacturers. Comprehensive activities relating to vehicle connectivity architecture and electronics as well as highperformance computers and software solutions round off the range of products and services. With its premium portfolio in the car truck bus twowheel and specialty tire segment Tires stands for innovative solutions in tire technology. Intelligent products and services related to tires and the promotion of sustainability complete the portfolio. For specialist dealers and fleet management Tires offers digital tire monitoring and tire management systems in addition to other services with the aim of keeping fleets mobile and increasing their efficiency. With its tires Continental contributes to safe efficient and environmentally friendly mobility. ContiTech focuses on development and materials expertise in products and systems made from rubber plastic metal and textiles which can also be equipped with electronic components to optimize their functionality for custom service applications. ContiTechs industrial growth areas are primarily in energy agriculture and construction as well as interior design. ContiTech also serves the automotive and transportation industries along with the railway engineering sector. The contract manufacturing of products by Continental companies for Vitesco Technologies is consolidated in Contract Manufacturing. This contract manufacturing is not intended to be a permanent situation rather the operational separation of production will continue to be promoted and the volume of contract manufacturing reduced. These segments correspond to the group sectors as defined in the Structure of the Continental Group section of the consolidated management report. Otherholdingconsolidation This comprises centrally managed subsidiaries and affiliates such as holding financing and insurance companies as well as the holding function of Continental AG and certain effects of consolidation. It also contains the effects on earnings of uncertain risks particularly those in connection with contractual and similar claims or obligations representing among other things risks from investments that cannot currently be assigned to the individual operating units. Internal control and reporting within the Continental Group are based on International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as described in Note . The Continental Group measures the performance of its segments on the basis of their adjusted operating result adjusted EBIT. Their performance is expressed as the return on sales adjusted EBIT divided by adjusted sales and as the return on capital employed ROCE which represents EBIT as a percentage of average operating assets. Intersegment sales and other proceeds are determined at arms length prices. For administrative services performed by centrally operated companies or by the Continental Groups management costs are calculated on an arms length basis in line with utilization. Where direct allocation is not possible costs are assigned according to the services performed. The segment assets comprise the operating assets of the assets side of the statement of financial position as at the end of the reporting period. The segment liabilities show the operating asset parts on the liabilities side of the statement of financial position. Capital expenditure relates to additions to property plant and equipment and software as well as additions to capitalized rightofuse assets in line with IFRS Leases and additions to capitalized borrowing costs in line with IAS Borrowing Costs. Depreciation and amortization include the scheduled diminution of and the impairment on intangible assets property plant and equipment capitalized rightofuse assets and investment properties as well as the impairment on goodwill. This figure does not include impairment on financial investments. Noncash expensesincome mainly include additions to and reversals of pension and warranty provisions as well as provisions for litigation and environmental risks. In the segment information broken down by country and region sales are allocated on the basis of the domicile of the respective customers in contrast capital expenditure and segment assets are allocated on the basis of the domicile of the respective companies. Viewed across all segments Continental recorded sales totaling . million PY . million with a group of companies under common control in the year under review. In the Continental Group generated of its sales in the USA PY in Germany PY and in China PY . Other than these countries there were no countries in which more than of sales were achieved as was also the case in the previous year. ,,0.39514589558729435,0.42760887179205753,0.3466118093136448,,0.3279105794284519,0.45183012532512185,0.4016411534994883,,,,,0.3580096162799614,,,,,,

710,Continental Aktiengesellschaft Continental AG whose registered office is ContinentalPlaza Hanover Germany is the parent company of the Continental Group and a listed stock corporation. It is entered in the commercial register of the Hanover Local Court Amtsgericht under HR B . The Continental Group is a supplier to the automotive industry with worldwide operations. The areas of business and main activities in which the Continental Group is engaged are described in more detail in the Segment Reporting section. The consolidated financial statements of Continental AG for fiscal were prepared by resolution of the Executive Board of February and will be submitted to and published in the German Federal Gazette Bundesanzeiger. Continental AG is included in the consolidated financial statements of INAHolding Schaeffler GmbH Co. KG Herzogenaurach Germany which are published in the German Federal Gazette. The consolidated financial statements of Continental AG as at December have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union pursuant to EU Regulation EC No. in conjunction with Section e of the German Commercial Code Handelsgesetzbuch HGB. The term IFRS also includes the International Accounting Standards IAS the interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee or its predecessor the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC and those of the former Standing Interpretations Committee SIC. All International Financial Reporting Standards mandatory for fiscal have been applied subject to endorsement by the European Union. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost with the exception of certain financial assets and liabilities including derivative instruments which are measured at fair value assets held for sale which are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell or costs to distribute and defined benefit pension plans for which the plan assets are measured at fair value. The annual financial statements of companies included in the Continental Group have been prepared using uniform accounting policies in accordance with IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements. The reporting date for the individual financial statements of companies included in the Continental Group is the same as the reporting date for the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in euros. Unless otherwise stated all amounts are shown in millions of euros millions. Please note that differences may arise as a result of the use of rounded amounts and percentages. In order to increase transparency Continental changed how income and expenses are presented in connection with specific warranties restructuring measures severance payments as well as impairment and reversal of impairment losses on intangible assets and property plant and equipment in the reporting year. Previously these items were reported under other income and other expenses as of fiscal they are assigned to the respective functional areas. This retrospective adjustment due to an amendment of the accounting policies in accordance with IAS Accounting Policies Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors led to a . million increase in cost of sales a . million increase in selling and logistics expenses and a . million increase in administrative expenses for the period from January to December . At the same time research and development expenses decreased by . million other income by . million and other expenses by . million. In addition the presentation of specific expenses primarily personnel expenses incurred in connection with the provision of development services to external customers was adjusted in the Automotive segment. Previously these expenses were reported under research and development expenses now they are reported under cost of sales. The adjustment led to a retrospective reduction in research and development expenses of . million while simultaneously increasing cost of sales by the same amount for the period from January to December . In the Tires segment the reporting of personnel expenses incurred in connection with activities in the workshops of tire companies was adjusted in the reporting year. Previously these expenses were reported under selling and logistics expenses now they are reported under cost of sales. The adjustment led to a retrospective reduction in selling and logistics expenses of . million while simultaneously increasing cost of sales by the same amount for the period from January to December . Companies consolidated All major subsidiaries that Continental AG controls in accordance with the provisions of IFRS have been included in the consolidated financial statements and are fully consolidated. To meet this definition Continental AG must have the decisionmaking power to control the relevant activities and a right to variable returns from the associated company. Furthermore it must be able to use its decisionmaking power to determine the amount of these returns. The companies consolidated may therefore also include companies that are controlled by Continental AG irrespective of the share of voting rights by way of other substantial rights such as contractual agreements as is the case with structured units included in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidation of subsidiaries is based on the acquisition method by offsetting the acquisition cost against the proportion of net assets attributed to the parent company at fair value at the acquisition date. Intangible assets not previously recognized in the separate financial statements of the acquired company are carried at fair value. Intangible assets identified in the course of a business combination including for example brand names patents technology customer relationships and order backlogs are recognized separately at the acquisition date only if the requirements under IAS Intangible Assets for an intangible asset are met. Measurement at the acquisition date is usually provisional only. Increases or reductions of assets and liabilities that become necessary within ,,,,,,,0.43602263344163283,,,,,,,,,,,,
711,months after the acquisition are made retrospectively as at the acquisition date. Significant adjustments are presented in the notes to the financial statements. Any positive remaining amount is capitalized as goodwill. The share of noncontrolling interests is measured using the share of remeasured net assets of the subsidiary. In order to ensure the recoverability of goodwill arising from an as yet incomplete measurement and the corresponding purchase price allocation the goodwill is allocated provisionally to the affected cashgenerating units CGUs as at the end of the reporting period. This provisional allocation can deviate significantly from the final allocation. Any negative difference that arises is recognized in other income after the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities has again been reviewed. Noncontrolling interests in the net assets of subsidiaries that are not attributable to the Continental Group are shown under Noncontrolling interests as a separate component of total equity. Once control has been obtained any differences arising from successive purchases of shares from noncontrolling interests between the purchase price and the carrying amount of those noncontrolling interests are recognized in other comprehensive income. Where there are successive purchases of shares resulting in control the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value at the time of firsttime consolidation for those shares already held is recognized in profit or loss under other income and expenses. Significant investments where Continental AG can exert significant influence on the associated companies associates are accounted for using the equity method. The carrying amount of these associates is adjusted to reflect the share in the associates net equity. If the financial statements of the associates are not available the share of earnings or losses is recognized as necessary based on estimated amounts. Goodwill arising from firsttime consolidation is reported using the equity method. Goodwill is not amortized but the carrying amount of investments in associates consolidated using the equity method is tested for impairment if there are relevant indications. Joint ventures are accounted for in the same way as associates. Companies that are dormant or have only a low level of business activity and therefore no significant impact on the earnings financial and net assets position of the Continental Group are not included in the consolidated financial statements. These are accounted for as other investments at fair value FVOCI. Intercompany receivables and payables in addition to income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Intercompany profits arising from internal transactions and dividend payments made within the Continental Group are eliminated on consolidation. Deferred taxes on the elimination of intercompany transactions are carried in the amount derived from the average income tax rate for the Continental Group. Currency translation The statements of financial position of foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the euro are translated into euros using the middle rate at the end of the reporting period closing rate. The income statements are translated at the average exchange rate for the year. Differences resulting from currency translation are recognized in the difference from currency translation in equity until the disposal of the subsidiary without recognizing deferred taxes. In the separate financial statements of Continental AG and its subsidiaries foreigncurrency receivables and payables are measured on recognition at the transaction rate and adjusted at the end of the reporting period to the related closing rates. Gains and losses arising on currency translation are recognized in profit or loss except for certain loans. Goodwill is recognized directly as an asset of the subsidiary acquired and therefore also translated into euros for subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the euro at the end of the reporting period using the middle rate closing rate. Differences resulting from currency translation are recognized in the difference from currency translation in equity. ,0.2799452255011036,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
714,Revenue recognition Only sales of products and services resulting from the ordinary business activities of the company are shown as sales revenue. In accordance with IFRS Revenue from Contracts with Customers Continental recognizes as revenue from contracts with customers the amount that is received as consideration for the transfer of goods or services to customers. The relevant point in time or period of time is the transfer of control of the goods or services to the customer control approach. To determine when to recognize revenue and at what amount the fivestep model is applied. By applying the fivestep model in the Continental Group to contracts with customers distinct performance obligations are identified. The transaction price is determined and allocated to the performance obligations according to the requirements of IFRS . Variable consideration in contracts with customers such as rebates bonus agreements or other kinds of price concessions is analyzed measured and included in the revenue recognition. The allocation of the transaction price in the case of more than one performance obligation at hand would be performed by using observable prices if possible. Otherwise the allocation would be performed using the adjusted market assessment approach or the approach of cost plus a margin. For every performance obligation that in accordance with IFRS is distinct within the context of the contract the revenue recognition is determined to be at a point in time or to be satisfied over time. Multicomponent contracts that contain distinct performance obligations with different timing of revenue recognition are not currently material. Description of sales revenue in automotive originalequipment business The type of performance obligations to customers in automotive originalequipment business relates to the diverse and predominantly customerspecific products of the Automotive Contract Manufacturing and ContiTech segments and the originalequipment business of the Tires segment please refer to the information provided on the group sectors in the Structure of the Continental Group section of the consolidated management report. Invoices are generally prepared once a month while the payment terms average days and differ mostly depending on the region andor product group. Payments are made by bank transfer in the vast majority of cases. No significant discounts on the invoice amount are granted however customer bonuses and other price reductions are included in the transaction price as variable price components in line with expectations. The customers do not usually make any significant advance payments. Revenue is almost always recognized over time using an outputbased measurement method and sales revenue is measured based on the products that leave the production plant as the products are produced and delivered just in time. There are no significant obligations from the right of customers to return products or from reimbursements to customers or similar obligations or from warranty commitments that include a service component. ,,0.32504413114208563,0.37263222982193167,0.35603129495633784,,0.357609753953899,0.5572323778345829,0.4403455559145379,0.3596271894194592,0.303935876883733,,,,0.3886628024595661,,,,,0.35288944481427514
715,Description of sales revenue in industrial and replacement business The type of performance obligations to customers in industrial and replacement business relates to the replacementtire and retail business of the Tires segment the industrial and retail business of the ContiTech segment and the replacementparts and retail business of the Automotive and Contract Manufacturing segments please refer to the information provided on the group sectors in the Structure of the Continental Group section of the consolidated management report. Invoices are generally prepared once a month while the payment terms for most of the sales average days and differ mostly depending on the region andor product group. Payments are made by bank transfer in the vast majority of cases with the exception of business with end customers and consumers who often pay in cash or by card. No significant discounts on the invoice amount are granted however customer bonuses and other price reductions are included in the transaction price as variable price components in line with expectations. The customers do not usually make any significant advance payments. Revenue is recognized at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer taking into account the agreed incoterms. There are no significant obligations from the right of customers to return products or from reimbursements to customers or similar obligations or from warranty commitments that include a service component. Description of revenue in other business activities Revenue in other business activities is included in the sales of the automotive originalequipment business in the sales of the industrial and replacement business and in other revenues. On the one hand services are provided and on the other project business is conducted in which developments for customers are made goods produced or services provided over a mediumterm or longer period. For this revenue there are no significant obligations from the right of customers to return products or from reimbursements to customers or similar obligations or from warranty commitments that include a service component. The largest component of this revenue relates to revenue from research and development which is recognized at a point in time either when the entire development is completed or when identifiable milestones within a development are reached. Invoices are generally prepared after completion of a milestone or an entire development and acceptance by the customer. Payments are made by bank transfer in most cases. No significant discounts on the invoice amount are granted. The customers do not usually make any significant advance payments. In addition services that are performed alongside the main business also lead to revenue recognition over time though in smaller amounts. Both input and outputbased measurement methods are used and sales are measured either based on the hours or days worked or the costs incurred input or based on the services rendered output. Invoices are generally prepared at least once a month and payments are made by bank transfer in most cases. No significant discounts on the invoice amount are granted. The customers do not usually make any significant advance payments. In addition project business is conducted in which generally customerspecific goods or services are produced or provided for customers over a mediumterm or longer period. Revenue from this is likewise recognized over time and sales are mostly measured using inputbased measurement methods taking account of the costs incurred. Invoices are generally issued as contractually agreed. Advance payments averaging are usually made by the customers before the start of a project. Payments are made by bank transfer in most cases. No significant discounts on the invoice amount are granted. Contract assets and contract liabilities Contract assets primarily arise in the project business from customerspecific goods or services for customers but are only of minor significance in the Continental Group. Contract assets must be recognized because the goods or services are provided over a mediumterm or longer period in which goods or services have already been provided by Continental but there is not yet an unconditional right against the customer i.e. a receivable. The right or part of the right to consideration from the customer is often only unconditional once the provision of the services has been completed and can then be recognized as a receivable and invoiced in full. The associated payments are generally made on the basis of actual invoicing. The recognition of receivables and the receipt of payments reduce the associated contract assets. Contract liabilities include mainly advance payments by customers for deliveries of goods and for services to be performed. In the case of these advance payments by customers for deliveries of goods and for services to be performed the customer has already paid the consideration or part of the consideration but Continental has generally not yet satisfied its performance obligation or has done so only to a limited extent. The provision of the corresponding services to the customers by Continental reduces the level of the associated contract liabilities. Research and development expenses Research and development expenses comprise expenditure on research and development and expenses for customerspecific applications prototypes and testing. Where refunds from customers for research and development expenses are agreed these costs are recognized in inventories until control is transferred. Once control is transferred the refund amounts are stated under other income. In addition the expenses are reduced by the amount relating to the application of research results from the development of new or substantially improved products if the related activity fulfills the recognition criteria for internally generated intangible assets set out in IAS Intangible Assets. This portion of the expenses is capitalized as an asset and amortized over a period of three to seven years from the date that the developed products become marketable. However expenses for customerspecific applications preproduction prototypes or tests for products already being marketed do not qualify as development expenditure which may be recognized as an intangible asset. Furthermore expenses incurred directly in connection with the launch of new production operations and plants are recognized directly in profit or loss. ,0.2837322855615853,0.41167327325704456,0.512226554988767,0.42474244016294727,0.4111628183834737,0.4495073603024073,0.6225896306321593,0.4835106435535937,0.3767014407755796,0.3423931841799462,0.43786430537176607,0.32292020020506806,0.3880639888390714,0.48988617437164544,0.30072588549455376,,,0.22360608955832495,0.4774629169527201
716,New developments for the originalequipment business are not marketable until Continental AG has been nominated as the supplier for the particular vehicle platform or model and furthermore has successfully fulfilled preproduction release stages. Moreover these release stages serve as the prerequisite to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the product especially given the high demands imposed on safety and comfort technology. Accordingly development costs are recognized as an asset only as at the date of nomination as supplier and upon fulfillment of a specific pre production release stage. The development is considered to be completed once the final approval for the unlimited production is granted. Only very few development projects fulfill the recognition criteria. Although suppliers are nominated by original equipment manufacturers with the general obligation to supply products over the entire life of the particular model or platform these supply agreements constitute neither longterm contracts nor firm commitments in particular because the original equipment manufacturers make no commitments in regard to purchase quantities. For this reason all preproduction expenses with the exception of the capitalized development costs as previously described are recognized immediately in profit or loss. Productrelated expenses Costs for advertising sales promotion and other salesrelated items are expensed as incurred. Provisions are recognized for possible warranty claims on sold products on the basis of past experience as well as legal and contractual terms. Additional provisions are recognized for specific known cases. Financial result and investment income Interest income and expenses are recognized for the period to which they relate. Dividends are recognized in profit or loss if legal entitlement to payment of the dividend is established the economic benefit associated with the dividend is likely to be received and the dividend amount can be measured reliably. Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of shares issued. Treasury stock is deducted for the period it is held. Diluted earnings per share also include shares from the potential exercise of option or conversion rights. The corresponding expenses that would no longer be incurred after the conversion or exchange are eliminated. Statement of financial position classification Assets and liabilities are reported as noncurrent assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position if they have a remaining term of over one year and conversely as current assets and liabilities if the remaining term is shorter. Liabilities are treated as current if there is no unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least months after the end of the reporting period. Pension provisions provisions for other postemployment benefits and other employee benefits as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities are accounted for as noncurrent. If assets and liabilities have both current and noncurrent portions the amounts are classified separately and shown as current and noncurrent assets or liabilities. Goodwill Goodwill corresponds to the difference between the acquisition cost and the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities of the business combination. Goodwill is not subject to amortization it is tested for impairment at least annually and if necessary impaired. The details of the annual impairment test are described under Impairment in this note. Once an impairment loss has been recognized on goodwill it is not reversed in subsequent periods. Intangible assets Purchased intangible assets are carried at acquisition costs and internally generated intangible assets at their production costs provided that the conditions for recognition of an internally generated intangible asset are met in accordance with IAS Intangible Assets. If intangible assets have finite useful lives they are amortized on a straightline basis over a useful life of three to eight years in general. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested at least annually for impairment and if necessary impaired. The details of the annual impairment test are described under Impairment in this note. Property plant and equipment Property plant and equipment is measured at cost less straightline depreciation. If necessary additional impairment is recognized on the affected items. Production cost consists of the direct costs and attributable material and manufacturing overheads including depreciation. Under certain conditions portions of the borrowing costs are capitalized as part of the acquisition cost. This also applies to finance leases and investment property. As soon as an asset is available for its intended use subsequent cost is capitalized only to the extent the related modification changes the function of the asset or increases its economic value and the cost can be clearly identified. All other subsequent expenditure is recognized as current maintenance expense. Property plant and equipment is broken down into the lowest level of the components that have significantly different useful lives and to the extent integrated in other assets when they are likely to be replaced or overhauled during the overall life of the related main asset. Maintenance and repair costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. The Continental Group has no property plant or equipment that by the nature of its operation and deployment can be repaired and serviced only in intervals over several years. The useful lives are up to years for buildings and land improvements up to years for technical equipment and machinery and up to years for operating and office equipment. ,,0.3530099128833504,0.4538992798471763,0.33076927893502567,,0.4144936839068015,0.4668115898870238,0.4263591339910358,,0.3081339563299516,,,,,,,,,
717,When assets are sold closed down or scrapped the difference between the net proceeds and the net carrying amount of the assets is recognized as gain or loss in other income or expense respectively. Government grants Government grants are reported if there is reasonable assurance that the conditions in place in connection with the grants will be fulfilled and that the grants will be awarded. Monetary government grants and government subsidies that are directly attributable to depreciable fixed assets are deducted from the procurement and manufacturing costs of the assets in question. All other monetary grants and subsidies are recognized as income in line with planning and are presented alongside the corresponding expenses. Nonmonetary government grants are recognized at fair value. Investment property Land and buildings held for the purpose of generating rental income instead of production or administrative purposes are carried at depreciated cost. Depreciation is charged on a straightline basis over the useful lives which correspond to those for real estate in use by the company. Leases A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. A lessee shall recognize a rightofuse asset and a corresponding lease liability which represents the lessees obligation to make lease payments. The lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments not yet made. It is recognized under indebtedness. Discounting is determined using the incremental borrowing rates as the interest rates underlying the leases often cannot be determined regularly. The rightofuseasset recognized by the lessee is measured at cost. This amount comprises the corresponding lease liability and prepaid lease payments taking into account any lease incentives received. It is recognized in property plant and equipment. Depreciation is charged on a straightline basis. The lease liability is subsequently measured according to the effective interest method. The resulting interest expense is recognized in the financial result. Continental utilizes the exemptions for shortterm leases and for leases in which the underlying asset is of low value. Continental leases property plant and equipment especially buildings. As lessor Continental classifies leases as operating leases or finance leases. For this classification Continental considers whether the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset. If this is the case it is a finance lease otherwise it is an operating lease. If Continental acts as an intermediate lessor the interests arising from the head lease and sublease are accounted for separately. The sublease is measured based on the value of the rightofuse asset resulting from the head lease and not based on the underlying asset. If the head lease is a shortterm lease for which the Continental Group applies the exemption provision it classifies the sublease as an operating lease. The Continental Group applies IFRS Revenue from Contracts with Customers when allocating the consideration in the contract to each lease and nonlease component. Impairment The Continental Group immediately reviews intangible assets and property plant and equipment investment property and goodwill as soon as there is an indication of impairment triggering event. Impairment is assessed by comparing the carrying amount with the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less cost of disposal and the present value of the expected future cash flows from the continued use of the asset value in use. If the carrying amount is higher than the recoverable amount the difference is recognized as impairment. If the indications for the prior recognition of impairment no longer apply the impairment losses are reversed for intangible assets property plant and equipment and investment property. Capitalized goodwill is generally tested for impairment once a year as at November at the level of cashgenerating units CGUs. CGUs are units that come below the segments and are the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. This represents the level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The impairment test is performed by comparing the carrying amount of the CGU including its goodwill and the recoverable amount of this CGU. The recoverable amount in this case is the value in use calculated on the basis of discounted cash flows before interest and tax. Impairment is recognized to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount for a CGU. If the reasons for this cease to apply in the future impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. ,0.28720389835419174,,,0.3743495816593228,0.36285293642692173,0.41802020691764696,0.40558888803917365,0.3971429489400368,0.33155847490883406,0.3120696388513862,,0.4923546805926583,,,0.29906289215192433,,,,
718,The expected cash flows of the CGUs are derived from longterm planning that usually covers the next five years and is approved by management. For the Autonomous Mobility CGU expected cash flow data is derived from its longterm planning that covers the next eight years. The plans are based in particular on assumptions regarding macroeconomic developments as well as trends in sales prices raw material prices and exchange rates derived in part from external sources. In addition to these current market forecasts past developments and experience are also taken into account. Furthermore Continentals internal CO,,,,,,,,0.37897524579539504,,,,,,,,,,,
719, shadow price is also taken into account in the assumptions for further details on its calculation please refer to the consolidated management report. For the perpetuity beyond the period of five years the cash flow is extrapolated using the expected longterm growth rates for the individual CGUs. The main assumptions when calculating the value in use of a CGU are the free cash flows the discount rate and its parameters and the longterm growth rate. Annual impairment testing was performed on the basis of the bottomup business plan for the next five years approved by management in the period under review. The cash flows of the CGUs of the Automotive segment were discounted with an interest rate before tax of . PY . those of the Tires segment with an interest rate of . PY . those of the ContiTech segment with an interest rate of . PY . and those of the Contract Manufacturing segment with an interest rate of . PY .. This pretax WACC is based on the capital structure of the respective relevant peer group on average over the last five years. The riskfree interest rate is . PY . and the market risk premium . PY .. Borrowing costs correspond to the interest rate on industrial bonds with the average rating derived via the peer group. For the annual impairment test the average growth rate in the detailed planning period was . PY . for the CGUs of the Automotive segment . PY . for those of the Tires segment and . PY . for those of the ContiTech segment. Contract manufacturing for Vitesco Technologies is reported in the Contract Manufacturing segment and will conclude by the end of the detailed planning period. The longterm growth rate was . PY . for the CGUs of the Automotive segment . PY . for those of the Tires and ContiTech segments and . PY . for those of the Contract Manufacturing segment. These growth rates do not exceed the longterm average growth rates for the markets in which the CGUs operate. The annual impairment testing of goodwill determined no requirements for impairment for . In the Original Equipment CGU of the Tires segment the carrying amount exceeded the value in use. As there was no significant goodwill the recoverability of the individual assets was reviewed whereby these are mainly productionrelated machines and buildings that are not used exclusively by the Original Equipment CGU but are also used by the three CGUs Replacement EMEA Europe the Middle East and Africa Replacement APAC AsiaPacific region and Replacement The Americas North Central and South America. This review did not reveal any need for impairment since the fair value less costs of disposal for the individual assets exceeds their respective carrying amount. Fair values were derived on the basis of valuation reports relating to the properties and current market values for comparable machinery and technical equipment among other things. Assuming a .percentagepoint increase in the discount rate would not lead to any goodwill impairment. No asset impairment would result. Reducing the longterm growth rate by . percentage points would not lead to any goodwill impairment. No asset impairment would result. If sales in perpetuity would decline by . consequently reducing free cash flow as a key planning parameter this would not lead to any goodwill impairment. No asset impairment would result. Assets held for sale and related liabilities A noncurrent asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale and is presented separately in the statement of financial position if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. For this to be the case the asset or disposal group must be available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets or disposal groups and its sale must be highly probable. A noncurrent asset or disposal group held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell where it meets the held for sale criteria. Depreciation of these assets ceases once they are classified as held for sale. Immediately before the initial classification of the asset or disposal group as held for sale the carrying amounts shall be measured in accordance with the applicable IFRS. A noncurrent asset or disposal group is classified as held for distribution to owners when the entity is committed to distribute the asset or disposal group to the owners. For this to be the case the assets must be available for immediate distribution in their present condition and the distribution must be highly probable. A noncurrent asset or disposal group held for distribution is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to distribute. ,,,,,,0.34523957934844846,,,,,,,,,,,,,
720,On subsequent remeasurement of a disposal group the carrying amounts of any assets and liabilities that are not within the scope of the measurement requirements of IFRS Noncurrent Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations but are included in a disposal group classified as held for sale shall be remeasured in accordance with the applicable IFRS before the fair value less costs to sell of the disposal group is remeasured. A discontinued operation can also be classified as held for sale under IFRS . A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The classification of a component of an entity as a discontinued operation is also appropriate in the case of classification as held for distribution provided the criteria are met. Financial instruments A financial instrument as defined in IAS Financial Instruments Presentation is a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. In the Continental Group a purchase or sale of financial assets or financial liabilities is recognized or derecognized at the settlement date. Financial assets Financial assets are recognized in the statement of financial position as at the date Continental becomes a contractual party to the financial instrument. At the acquisition date they must be classified into measurement categories that determine the subsequent accounting. Receivables from the receivables factoring programs carried out in the Continental Group are recognized in the statement of financial position when the risks and rewards in particular credit and default risk have not been essentially transferred. The repayment obligations therefrom are as a rule then shown as shortterm financial liabilities. The classification and measurement of financial assets that constitute debt instruments is based on the business model in which the assets are managed and on their cash flow characteristics. These conditions are cumulative criteria whose audit sequence is irrelevant. It is therefore necessary to analyze the business model in which the asset to be classified is held. This relates to the investigation of the way in which financial assets held in order to collect cash flows are managed. The Continental Group reclassifies debt instruments if the corresponding business model changes. IFRS Financial Instruments distinguishes between three business models ,,,0.4087337427270012,0.36703323697124135,0.44738353667660324,0.32350504954247256,0.5061919757870056,0.4107963049973624,0.3393058045612785,0.33091208418259593,0.5243165966751238,0.37968802135010177,0.3082317304254175,0.4190656784241497,0.34561750213562753,0.24869678659837555,,0.2163865460742903,0.4459972689517776

In addition to the analysis of the business model the contractual terms applicable on acquisition of the financial instrument must also be assessed SPPI solely payments of principal and interest criterion. The SPPI criterion is met when the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are consistent with a basic lending arrangement. ,,,,0.35649105643678447,,,0.4765537648176804,0.3706022839741367,0.36096364096284345,0.30180720965455815,0.4619660512003124,0.3328999786716072,0.3474957106523297,0.43611352432853384,,,,0.211951260050484,0.38310464414168444

725,Measured at cost The financial asset which constitutes a debt instrument is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows. Furthermore the contractual cash flows can be characterized as payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

Gains or losses arising from derecognition are recognized in profit or loss together with the foreigncurrency gains and losses.

733,Embedded derivatives An embedded derivative is a component of a hybrid contract alongside a nonderivative host contract. A portion of the cash flows of the hybrid contract is therefore subject to similar variability as a separate derivative. Nonderivative host contracts with the exception of financial assets are regularly inspected within the Continental Group for embedded derivatives. If the host contract does not fall under the scope of IFRS or if the host contract is a financial liability embedded derivatives must be separated from the host contract if the assessment finds that the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract a separate instrument with the same terms would meet the definition of a derivative and Continental does not exercise the option to measure the entire hybrid instrument at fair value through profit or loss. If separation is appropriate the host contract is accounted for in accordance with the relevant IFRS requirements. The embedded derivative is recognized at fair value through profit or loss FVPL. Inventories Inventories are recognized at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Acquisition cost is generally determined using the weightedaverage method. Production cost includes direct costs productionrelated material costs overheads and depreciation. Inventory risks resulting from decreased marketability or excessive storage periods are accounted for with writedowns. Other assets Other assets are recognized at amortized cost. Allowances are recognized as appropriate to reflect any possible risk related to recoverability. Accounting for income taxes Income taxes are measured using the concept of the statement of financial position liability method in accordance with IAS Income Taxes. Tax expenses and refunds that relate to income are recognized as income taxes. Late payment fines and interest arising from subsequently assessed taxes are not reported under the item income tax expense but rather as interest income and expense. Current taxes owed on income are recognized as expenses when they are incurred. They are determined taking into account the respective local tax laws and relevant case law. The complexity of these regulations and the possible differences in interpretation between taxpayers on the one hand and local tax authorities on the other may lead to uncertainties regarding the handling of individual facts and circumstances. These uncertain tax positions are measured in accordance with IFRIC as the mostly likely amount. Owing to the lack of an unrestricted market comparison determining prices for crossborder intercompany transactions is extremely complex and therefore subject to uncertainty. In the Continental Group prices are therefore regularly determined on the basis of the internationally recognized arms length principle taking into account the transfer pricing methods specified by lawmakers and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD. If there are multiple tax uncertainties and a correlation between them and certain tax parameters they are presented in the financial statements either individually or as a group depending on how the risk is realized. Deferred taxes include expected tax payments and refunds from temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the related tax bases as well as from the utilization of loss carryforwards. No deferred tax is recognized for nontaxdeductible goodwill. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the applicable tax rates related to the period when the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Changes in tax rates are recognized once the rate has been substantially enacted. Deferred tax assets are not recognized if it is not probable that they will be realized in the future. In a countryspecific review the extent to which taxrelated risks that are likely to occur can or must be offset against losses or loss carryforwards in the individual countries or tax groups is analyzed. If there is a need for offsetting in the countries or tax groups the probable taxrelated risks are offset against the associated losses and loss carryforwards. As a result the disclosure of deferred taxes on loss carryforwards includes a risk adjustment for the Continental Group units affected. Income tax receivables and liabilities are recognized as current items as they are due immediately and this due date often cannot be deferred. As at the end of the reporting period the regulations known as the Pillar Two Model Rules of the OECD governing a global minimum corporate tax rate had already been carried over into German law under the Minimum Tax Act Mindeststeuergesetz MinStG and apply from January . The Continental Group falls within the scope of these regulations. The minimum tax is levied at the level of INAHolding Schaeffler GmbH Co. KG Herzogenaurach Germany as the parent company of the IHO Group ultimate parent entity and group parent. Within the framework of the requirements stipulated by the minimum tax regulations Continental AG as the parent company of the Continental Group acts as a partially owned parent entity. Continental AG is included in the consolidated financial statements of INAHolding Schaeffler GmbH Co. KG Herzogenaurach Germany and for this reason is jointly assessed with the other companies of the IHO Group when determining the minimum tax. Continental AG is obligated in accordance with Section MinStG to compensate INAHolding Schaeffler GmbH Co. KG Herzogenaurach Germany for the share of the minimum tax attributable to Continental AG. Owing to the expected introduction of socalled recognized national topup taxes it is possible that the duty to pay the minimum tax due may fall on group subsidiaries other than Continental AG. The rules governing the global minimum tax stipulate that per country the difference between the effective tax rate in accordance with the global minimum tax rules and the minimum tax rate based on the adjusted minimum tax profit is to be paid as the minimum tax by the ultimate parent entity i.e. INAHolding ,,,,,,0.3496010118630811,0.41906549860398246,0.36118867290258316,0.3329435792010221,0.3043622947194145,,0.29264784567756147,,,,,,,
734,Schaeffler GmbH Co. KG Herzogenaurach Germany. In a transition period for the fiscal years through socalled safe harbor rules linked to the fulfillment of certain criteria may be utilized that allow companies to dispense with the exact calculation of the minimum tax with the minimum tax being set at zero in such cases. Continental together with the IHO Group has conducted an initial indicative analysis to determine the future impact of the regulations governing the global minimum tax. In Argentina Greece the Philippines Singapore Spain South Korea and the United Arab Emirates a tax rate of less than may apply based on the global minimum tax regulations. The proportional minimum tax expense for the Continental Group based on this analysis lies in the midsevenfigure range. The anticipated impact on the effective corporate tax rate is therefore insignificant. Employee benefits The retirement benefits offered by the Continental Group comprise both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Pension provisions under defined benefit plans are actuarially measured pursuant to IAS Employee Benefits revised using the projected unit credit method that reflects salary pension and employee fluctuation trends. The discount rate to determine the present value is based on longterm loans in the respective capital market. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income. Expenses from interest cost on pension liabilities and income from pension funds are reported net in the financial result. Accordingly the interest effects of other longterm employee benefits are reported in the financial result. Pension liabilities for some companies of the Continental Group are covered by pension funds. Furthermore plan assets comprise all assets as well as claims from insurance contracts that are held exclusively toward payments to those entitled to pensions and are not available to meet the claims of other creditors. Pension obligations and plan assets are reported on a net basis in the statement of financial position. The other postemployment benefits also shown under the employee benefits relate to obligations to pay for health costs for retired workers in the USA and Canada in particular. Defined contribution plans represent retirement benefits where the company only contributes contractually fixed amounts for current service entitlements which are generally invested by independent external asset managers until the date of retirement of the employee. The fixed amounts are partly dependent on the level of the employees own contribution. The company gives no guarantees of the value of the asset after the fixed contribution either at the retirement date or beyond. The entitlement is therefore settled by the contributions paid in the year. Provisions for other risks and obligations Provisions are recognized when a legal or constructive obligation has arisen that is likely to result in a future cash outflow to third parties and the amount can be reliably determined or estimated. The provisions are recognized as at the end of the reporting period at the value at which the obligations could probably be settled or transferred to a third party. Noncurrent provisions such as those for litigation or environmental risks are discounted to their present value. The resulting periodic interest charge for the provisions is shown under the financial result including an effect from a change in interest. Nonfinancial liabilities Current nonfinancial liabilities are carried at their settlement amount. Noncurrent nonfinancial liabilities are measured at amortized cost. Sharebased payments Cashsettled sharebased payments are measured at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation. The liabilities are recognized under employee benefits until the end of the holding period. Equitysettled sharebased payments are measured at the fair value of the granted equity instruments. Estimates Proper and complete preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the amount and disclosure of the recognized assets and liabilities income and expenses as well as the disclosures in the notes for the reporting period.

754,Consolidated statement of cash flows The statement of cash flows shows the sources during the reporting period that generated cash and cash equivalents as well as the application of cash and cash equivalents. This includes all cash and cash equivalents and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are shortterm highly liquid financial investments that can be readily converted into known cash amounts and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. The restrictions that may impact the availability of capital are also understood to comprise all existing restrictions on the cash and cash equivalents. In the Continental Group the cash and cash equivalents are restricted with regard to pledged amounts and balances in countries with foreignexchange restrictions or other barriers to accessing liquidity. Taxes to be paid on the transfer of cash assets from one country to another are not usually considered to represent a restriction on cash and cash equivalents. Financial investments are considered to be cash equivalents only if they have a remaining original term not exceeding three months. ,,,,,,,,0.3525923054055728,0.33571103951903686,0.30998732491290215,0.43511382704429297,,,,,,,,
756,In accordance with EU Regulation EC No. in conjunction with Section e of the German Commercial Code Handelsgesetzbuch HGB Continental AG has prepared its consolidated financial statements in compliance with IFRS as adopted by the Commission of the European Communities under the European Union endorsement procedure. Accordingly IFRS are only required to be applied following endorsement of the new standards by the EU Commission. The following endorsed standards interpretations issued in relation to published standards and amendments that were applicable to the consolidated financial statements of Continental AG became effective in and have been adopted accordingly The amendments to IAS Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement Making Materiality Judgements Disclosure of Accounting Policies provide guidance and examples to clarify the application of materiality judgments to accounting policy disclosures. The amendments replace the requirement to disclose significant accounting policies with the requirement to disclose material accounting policies. Furthermore the amendments add guidance on how to apply the concept of materiality in the context of accounting policy disclosures. The amendments are required to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January . The amendments had no significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of Continental AG. The amendments to IAS Accounting Policies Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors Definition of Accounting Estimates replace the previous definition of a change in accounting estimate with a definition of accounting estimates to clarify the distinction between accounting policies and accounting estimates. Accounting estimates are monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty. The amendments are required to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January . The amendments had no significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of Continental AG. The amendments to IAS Income TaxesDeferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction narrow the scope of the initial recognition exemption in IAS so that it no longer applies to transactions that on initial recognition give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The amendments are required to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January . The amendments had no significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of Continental AG. The amendments to IAS Income Taxes International Tax Reform Pillar Two Model Rules introduce a temporary exception to the accounting for deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes. The amendments also require an entity to disclose that it has applied the temporary exception and to disclose separately its current tax expense income related to Pillar Two income taxes. In periods in which Pillar Two legislation is enacted or substantively enacted but not yet in effect an entity is required to disclose known or reasonably estimable qualitative and quantitative information that helps users of financial statements to assess the entitys exposure to Pillar Two income taxes arising from that legislation. To the extent information is not known or reasonably estimable an entity should instead disclose a statement to that effect and disclose information about the entitys progress in assessing its exposure. The temporary exception to the accounting for deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes as well as the obligation to disclose that the mandatory exception will be applied are required to be applied immediately after the publication of the amendment which was on May . The other new disclosure requirements of the amendment are required to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January . The amendments had no significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of Continental AG. ,,,,,,,0.4083190374524206,,,,,,,,,,,,
757,IFRS Insurance Contracts replaces IFRS Insurance Contracts and establishes principles for the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts issued. In June further amendments and clarifications were made to IFRS in order to simplify the requirements of the standard and facilitate the transition to the new regulations. The standard and the consequential amendments to other standards were originally required to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January . The amendments to IFRS deferred the effective date of IFRS including the amendments to IFRS and the consequential amendments to other standards by two years to annual reporting periods beginning on or after January . The standard and the consequential amendments to other standards had no significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of Continental AG. The amendment to IFRS Insurance ContractsInitial Application of IFRS and IFRS Comparative Information adds a transition option classification overlay for entities that apply IFRS and IFRS at the same time. An entity is permitted to apply the option for the purpose of presenting comparative information about a financial asset if the comparative information has not been restated for IFRS . This is the case when the entity chooses not to restate prior periods or if the entity restates prior periods but the financial asset has been derecognized during those prior periods. When applying the option the comparative information should be presented as if the classification and measurement requirements of IFRS for financial assets had been applied. For entities that have applied IFRS before they apply IFRS the option applies to financial assets that have been derecognized in the comparative period. In this case an entity is permitted to apply the redesignation requirements of IFRS based on how the entity expects the asset would have been designated at the date of initial application of IFRS . The amendment is required to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January . The amendment had no significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of Continental AG.The following standards interpretations issued in relation to published standards and amendments have already been adopted by the EU but will not take effect until a later date The amendments to IAS Presentation of Financial StatementsClassification of Liabilities as Current or Noncurrent in clarify the classification of a liability. For a liability to be classified as noncurrent the entitys substantial right to defer settlement of the liability for at least months after the reporting period must exist at the end of the reporting period. For a liability to be noncurrent an assessment is required of whether an entity has the right to defer settlement of a liability and not whether the entity will exercise that right. Furthermore the amendments clarify the circumstances in which counterparty conversion options in relation to issued equity instruments affect classification as current or noncurrent. The amendments also specified how an entity should assess whether it has the right to defer settlement of a liability when that right is subject to compliance with specified conditions covenants within months after the reporting period. Due to strong concerns about its interpretation the IASB addressed this point and made improvements in further amendments to IAS in . These further amendments to IAS Presentation of Financial Statements Noncurrent Liabilities with Covenants clarify that covenants to be complied with after the reporting period do not affect the classification of the corresponding liability as current or noncurrent at the end of the reporting period. Instead the amendments require an entity to disclose information about these covenants in the notes to the financial statements.The amendments to IAS Presentation of Financial StatementsClassification of Liabilities as Current or Noncurrent in were originally required to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January . The additional amendment to IAS Presentation of Financial StatementsClassification of Liabilities as Current or Noncurrent Deferral of Effective Date in July deferred the effective date of the amendments by one year to annual reporting periods beginning on or after January as operational relief due to the COVID pandemic. With the further amendments to IAS Presentation of Financial Statements Noncurrent Liabilities with Covenants in all amendments to IAS together are required to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January . The amendments are expected to have a significant effect on the future consolidated financial statements of Continental AG. In the opening statement of financial position as at January the syndicated loan utilized at the end of the reporting period in the amount of . million is reclassified from current to noncurrent items. The amendments to IFRS Leases Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback refine the accounting treatment for sale and leaseback transactions. The amendments specify the requirements that a sellerlessee should apply when measuring the lease liability arising from a sale and leaseback transaction to ensure that the sellerlessee does not recognize a gain or loss from the right of use retained. The amendments are required to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January . The amendments are not expected to have any significant effect on the future consolidated financial statements of Continental AG. The following standards interpretations issued in relation to published standards and amendments have not yet been adopted by the EU and will become effective at a later date The amendments to IAS Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS Financial Instruments Disclosures Supplier Finance Arrangements require an entity to provide additional disclosures about its supplier finance arrangements that enable users of financial statements to assess the effects of those arrangements on the entitys liabilities and cash flows and on the entitys exposure to liquidity risk. The amendments are required to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January . The amendments are not expected to have any significant effect on the future consolidated financial statements of Continental AG. The amendments to IAS The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates Lack of Exchangeability require an entity to apply a consistent approach to assessing whether a currency is exchangeable into another currency and when it is not to determining the exchange rate to use and the disclosures to provide. A currency is exchangeable into another currency when an entity is able to obtain the other currency within a time frame that allows for a normal administrative delay and through a market or exchange mechanism in which an exchange transaction would create enforceable rights and obligations. If an entity is able to obtain no more than an insignificant amount of the other currency at the measurement date for the specified purpose the currency is not exchangeable ,,,,,,,0.4186883452711062,,,0.28938254139571495,,,,,,0.252590384676407,,,

845,In addition to cash outflows for the interest and principal portion of recognized lease liabilities the cash outflow for leases also includes variable lease payments and lease payments for unrecognized leases for lowvalue assets as well as for shortterm leases. Potential future cash outflows The leases recognized as at December include options that were not considered reasonably certain as at the reporting date and are not included in the measurement of lease liabilities. These options may result in potential future cash outflows over the coming fiscal years. The leases in some cases include variable lease payments as well as extension termination and purchase options. As a rule the Continental Group endeavors to include extension and termination options in new leases in order to ensure operational flexibility. For the initial measurement of lease liabilities such options are recognized once it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. If a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs that is within Continentals control this will be taken into account accordingly in the remeasurement of lease liabilities. As at the end of the reporting period potential future lease payments of . million PY . million from such options were not included in the measurement of lease liabilities. Potential future cash outflows of . million PY . million arising from variable lease payments were likewise not included in the measurement of lease liabilities as at the end of the reporting period. The yearonyear change is mainly due to the gradual reduction in contract manufacturing with Vitesco Technologies. The future scope of obligations arising from leases to which Continental is committed but that had not yet commenced as at the balance sheet date amounted to . million PY . million. The Continental Group estimates the potential cash outflow from residual value guarantees which were not included in the measurement of the lease liability as at the reporting date at . million PY . million. Contract manufacturing In the Continental Group concluded a framework agreement with Vitesco Technologies on contract manufacturing.

846,agreement in certain cases includes an embedded lease whereby Continental acts as lessee of the production equipment and bears the investment risk. Due to variable lease payments from Continental to Vitesco Technologies which are made according to customer calls for delivery no rightofuse assets or corresponding lease liabilities are recognized. In the fiscal year under review the expenses for variable lease payments due to contract manufacturing amounted to . million PY . million. In connection with contract manufacturing the Continental Group expects future cash outflows from variable lease payments of . million PY . million for the remaining lease terms. Continental Group as lessor The Continental Group acts as lessor in some business relationships. These constitute operating leases as well as finance leases. Whereas for operating leases the Continental Group retains the material risks and rewards incidental to ownership for finance leases these are transferred to the lessee. Operating leases Lease income from operating leases in which the Continental Group acts as lessor amounted to . million PY . million. These related primarily to the subleasing of land and buildings. Future cash inflows resulting from operating leases as at the end of the reporting period are shown in the following table ,,,,0.39023569045688217,,0.4006160863441546,0.4430283038993992,0.41554088128614575,0.39534681521075804,0.3177514427034474,,0.4118614019404851,,,,,,,0.36237579639648865

848,Contract manufacturing Insofar as the Continental Group manufactures products on behalf of Vitesco Technologies as part of contract manufacturing the agreement in certain cases includes an embedded lease whereby Continental acts as lessor. Such leases are classified as operating leases. The Continental Group receives variable lease payments depending on customer calls for delivery. Income in the reporting year related to variable lease payments due to contract manufacturing amounted to . million PY . million. Finance leases The Continental Group acts exclusively as a sublessor of leased land and buildings. As these subleases extend beyond the total remaining term of the head lease they are classified as finance leases. ,,,0.40991752267017945,,,0.3628718602084499,,,,,,0.3388545804508289,,,,,,,

895,The aim of the Continental Group is to maintain a strong capital base in order to preserve the trust of the capital market customers and employees and to ensure the sustainable development of the company. To assess the achievement of these goals the Continental Group uses the equity ratio defined as equity reported in the statement of financial position including noncontrolling interests divided by total assets and the gearing ratio as key figures. The gearing ratio is calculated as net indebtedness corresponding to the amount of interestbearing financial liabilities the fair values of derivative instruments cash and cash equivalents and other interestbearing investments divided by equity as disclosed in the statement of financial position including noncontrolling interests. In general the gearing ratio should be below in the coming years. If justified by extraordinary financing reasons or specific market circumstances we can rise above this ratio under certain conditions. The equity ratio should exceed .

901,Some prior commitments were granted through two legally independent pension contribution funds. Pensionskasse für Angestellte der Continental Aktiengesellschaft VVaG and Pensionskasse von der Phoenix AG VVaG have been closed since March and July respectively. The pension contribution funds are smaller associations within the meaning of Section of the German Insurance Supervision Act Versicherungsaufsichts gesetz VAG and are subject to the supervision of the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht. The investment regulations are in accordance with the legal requirements and risk structure of the obligations. The pension contribution funds have tariffs with an interest rate of . or .. Under the German Company Pensions Law Betriebsrentengesetz BetrAVG Continental is ultimately liable for the implementation path of the pension contribution fund. In accordance with IAS Employee Benefits the pension obligations covered by the pension contribution fund are therefore defined benefit pension plans. The pension contribution funds met their minimum net funding requirement as at December . However given that only the plan members are entitled to the assets and amounts generated the benefit obligations are recognized in the same amount as the existing assets at fair value. Continental also supports private contribution through deferred compensation schemes. Deferred compensation is essentially offered through a fully funded multiemployer plan Höchster Pensionskasse VVaG for contributions up to of the assessment ceiling in social security. The pension contribution fund ensures guaranteed minimum interest for which Continental is ultimately liable under the German Company Pensions Law. The company is not liable for guarantees to employees of other companies. As Höchster Pensionskasse VVaG is a combined defined benefit plan for several companies and Continental has no right to the information required for accounting for this defined benefit plan this plan is recognized as a defined contribution plan. Entitled employees can use the cash balance plan for deferred compensation contributions above the assessment ceiling. This share is funded by insurance annuity contracts. USA Owing to its acquisition history Continental has various defined benefit plans in the USA which were closed to new entrants and frozen to accretion of further benefits in a period from April to December . In acquisitions also included an open defined benefit plan for unionized employees. The closed defined benefit plans are commitments on the basis of the average final salary and cash balance commitments. The defined benefit plans for unionized and nonunionized employees are based on a pension multiplier per year of service. Closed defined benefit plans were replaced by defined contribution plans. Defined contribution plans apply to the majority of active employees in the USA. Due to the rise in interest rates further efforts are currently being made to push for additional funding. The plan assets of the defined benefit plans are managed in a master trust. Investment supervision was delegated to the Pension Committee a body appointed within the Continental Group. The legal and regulatory framework for the plans is based on the US Employee Retirement Income Security Act ERISA. The valuation of the financing level is required on the basis of this law. The interest rate used for this calculation is the average rate over a period of years and therefore currently higher than the interest rate used to discount obligations under IAS . The statutory valuation therefore gives rise to a lower obligation than that in line with IAS . There is a regulatory requirement to ensure minimum funding of in the defined benefit plans to prevent benefit curtailments. United Kingdom Continental maintains four defined benefit plans as a result of its history of acquisitions in the United Kingdom. All plans are commitments on the basis of the average or final salary. The four plans were closed to new employees in the period between April and November . Continental offers defined contribution plans for all employees who have joined the company since that time. As at April the Continental Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme was frozen to accretion of further benefits. It was replaced by a defined contribution plan as at April . As at July the Mannesmann UK Pension Scheme was frozen to accretion of further benefits. It was replaced by a defined contribution plan as at August . Our pension strategy in the UK focuses on reducing risks and includes the option of partial or complete funding by purchasing annuities. The rise in interest rates and the good funded status currently present opportunities to push for partial or complete funding. The receptivity of the insurance market is currently limited. The funding conditions are defined by the UK Pensions Regulator and the corresponding laws and regulations. The defined benefit plans are managed by trust companies. The boards of trustees of these companies have an obligation solely to the good of the beneficiaries on the basis of the trust agreement and the law. ,,,,,,,,,,,0.43681584962253545,,,,,0.24490955237455453,,,
902,The necessary funding is determined every three years through technical valuations in line with local provisions. The obligations are measured using a discount rate based on government bonds and other conservatively selected actuarial assumptions. Compared with IAS which derives the discount rate from senior corporate bonds this usually results in a higher obligation. Three of the four defined benefit plans had a funding deficit on the basis of the most recent technical valuation. The trustees and the company have agreed on a recovery plan that provides for additional temporary annual payments. The valuation process must be completed within months of the valuation date. The most recent technical valuations of the four defined benefit pension plans took place with their valuation dates between December and March and led to the following result ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.27548930428718815,,,
912,. million PY . million of the defined benefit obligations as at December related to plans that are fully or partially funded and . million PY . million related to plans that are unfunded. The . million increase in the defined benefit obligations compared with December resulted in particular from actuarial losses from changes in financial assumptions. The fund assets in Germany include the CTA assets amounting to . million PY . million pension contribution fund assets of . million PY . million and insurance annuity contracts amounting to . million PY . million. Fund assets increased by . million in the reporting year to . million. Actuarial gains and losses on fund assets in Germany resulted from actuarial gains of . million PY actuarial losses of . million from the CTAs. In the Continental Group there are pension contribution funds for previously defined contributions in Germany that have been closed to new entrants since July and March respectively. As at December the minimum net funding requirement was exceeded Continental AG has no requirement to make additional contributions. The pension fund assets had a fair value of . million as at December PY . million. The pension contribution funds have tariffs with an interest rate of . or .. Under the German Company Pensions Law Continental AG is ultimately liable for the implementation path of the pension contribution fund. It therefore constitutes a defined benefit pension plan that must be reported in line with the development of pension provisions. However given that only the plan members are entitled to the assets and income generated the benefit obligations are recognized in the same amount as the existing assets at fair value.

965,The term of the tranche which was resolved on March by the Supervisory Board for the members of the Executive Board and on May by the Executive Board for senior executives begins retroactively as at January and is four years. After the expiry of the LTI tranche in December the bonus was not paid out in as the fair value of the tranche as at the payment date was . million. For each beneficiary of an LTI tranche the Supervisory Board for the members of the Executive Board or the Executive Board for senior executives of Continental AG specified the amount of a target bonus in euros to be paid out upon target achievement. The actual LTI bonus paid out on expiry of the LTI tranche depends on the degree of target achievement. The LTI bonus can range between no payment and maximum payment. The degree of achievement of two target criteria is decisive for the payment and amount of the LTI bonus. The first target criterion is the equally weighted average of the Continental Value Contribution CVC of the Continental Group over a period of four fiscal years starting from the fiscal year in which the LTI tranche is issued. The equally weighted average is calculated by adding together of the CVC of the four fiscal years of the term of the LTI tranche. The second target criterion is the total shareholder return TSR on Continental shares as at the end of the term in relation to the beginning of the LTI tranche. The share price used in calculating the TSR is the arithmetic mean of closing prices in Xetra trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or a successor system on the trading days in the three months from October to December before the issue and expiry of the LTI tranche. In addition all dividends paid during the term of the LTI tranche are taken into account for the TSR. The scale for determining the degree of target achievement is defined by the Supervisory Board or the Executive Board when the respective LTI tranche is issued. This key data is identical for the members of the Executive Board and senior executives. The degree of target achievement for the first target criterion can lie between and . Target achievement is calculated on a straightline basis between and the maximum amount. There is no cap for the second target criterion. The ultimate degree of target achievement used to calculate the LTI bonus to be paid out is determined by multiplying the two target criteria. The LTI bonus to be paid out is determined by multiplying the degree of target achievement by the target bonus. The total maximum achievable LTI bonus is of the target bonus. A Monte Carlo simulation is used in the measurement of the TSR target criterion. This means that lognormal distributed processes are simulated for the price of Continental shares. The Monte Carlo simulation takes into account the average value accumulation of share prices in the respective reference period the TSR dividends and the restriction for the payment amount. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.26711904042677975,,,
966, Transformation Incentive Plan TIP In the Continental Group offered its senior executives the possibility of participating in the longterm sustainable increase in the Continental Groups value by paying a TIP bonus in addition to the fixed salary and the annual variable remuneration. The term of the TIP which the Executive Board adopted for senior executives on September extends from October to December . After the expiry of the TIP bonus in December the bonus was paid out in June . The Executive Board of Continental AG specified the amount of the target bonus TIP bonus in euros for each beneficiary of a TIP bonus senior executives. The TIP bonus is calculated based on a certain number of virtual shares of Continental AG basic holding which can increase through two bonus packages multiplied by the payment share price. The payment share price is the arithmetic mean of Continental AGs closing share prices in Xetra trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or a successor system on the trading days in the last month prior to the Annual Shareholders Meeting that follows the end of the term. The TIP bonus which can total at most of the initial share price is paid to the respective beneficiary as a gross lump sum at the end of the second complete calendar month following the Annual Shareholders Meeting that follows the end of the term. Since the basic holding can be increased through two bonus packages the degree of achievement of two target criteria is decisive for the amount of the TIP bonus. The target criterion of the first bonus package is the results of the OUR BASICS Live corporate survey in . If at least equally weighted average of all participants respond positively to the Sustainable Engagement Index the beneficiary receives additional virtual shares equivalent to of the basic holding. The target criterion of the second bonus package is met if at the end of the term the TSR on Continental shares equals or exceeds the performance of the STOXX Europe Automobiles Parts Index. In this case the beneficiary receives additional virtual shares equivalent to of the basic holding. The TSR on Continental shares corresponds to the sum of the share price performance as at the end of the term and all dividends distributed during the term relative to the share price at the beginning of the term. The share price used in calculating the TSR is the arithmetic mean of the closing prices in Xetra trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or a successor system on the trading days i in the first month of the term initial share price and ii in the last month of the term final share price. ,,,,,,,,,0.3188524455257803,,,,,,,,,,

Performance bonus deferral under the remuneration systemThe performance bonus was based on a target amount that the Supervisory Board determined for each Executive Board member for target achievement. Target criteria were the yearonyear change in the CVC and the return on capital employed ROCE. For Executive Board members with responsibility for a particular business area these criteria related to the relevant business area for other Executive Board members they related to the Continental Group. The CVC target was achieved if the CVC was unchanged compared with the previous year. If the CVC fell or rose by a defined percentage this element was reduced to zero or reached a maximum of . In the case of a negative CVC in the previous year target achievement was based on the degree of improvement. The criteria for the ROCE target were guided by planning targets. This component could also be omitted if a certain minimum value was not achieved. The CVC target was weighted at and the ROCE target at in the calculation of the performance bonus. In any event the performance bonus was capped at of the target bonus. ,,,,,,0.32731568219363577,,,0.32384899163961517,0.29294816499958604,,,,,0.31404971547213717,0.3265824269553903,,,

For each financial performance criterion the target value for target achievement corresponds to the value that the Supervisory Board agreed in each case for this financial performance criterion in the planning for the respective fiscal year. For each financial performance criterion the Supervisory Board determines the values for target achievement of and on an annual basis. The degree to which the target is achieved is calculated on a straightline basis between and by comparing this with the respective actual value for the fiscal year. In addition prior to the start of each fiscal year the Supervisory Board can determine personal nonfinancial performance criteria to be included in target achievement in the form of a personal contribution factor hereinafter PCF with a value between . and . for individual or all members of the Executive Board. After the end of the fiscal year the target achievement for each financial performance criterion is calculated on the basis of the audited consolidated financial statements of Continental AG and the sum total of these financial performance criteria is multiplied by the STI target amount in accordance with the weighting described above.

989,The additions to restructuring provisions resulted mainly from a program to simplify administrative structures processes and hierarchical levels in the Automotive segment. The program is to be implemented gradually by the end of . Further significant additions to restructuring provisions resulted from the planned closure of a German location in the Automotive segment which will be implemented gradually by the end of . Contrary to the original estimates of the effects from restructuring plans agreements were reached over the course of the restructuring measures that resulted in reversals in all segments. The utilization of restructuring provisions mainly related to the implementation of restructuring measures adopted in previous years. The additions to and reversals of provisions for litigation and environmental risks related in particular to product liability risks in the Tires segment in the USA and risks in connection with disputes over industrial property rights. Please see Note . The utilizations relate mainly to the aforementioned product liability risks in the Tires segment and risks in connection with disputes over industrial property rights. The changes in provisions for warranties include utilizations of . million PY . million and reversals of . million PY . million which are offset by additions of . million PY . million. The changes result mainly from specific individual cases within the Automotive and ContiTech segments. The other provisions also include provisions for risks from operations such as those in connection with compensation from customer and supplier claims that are not warranties. They also include provisions for dismantling and tirerecycling obligations and provisions for possible interest payments and penalties on income tax liabilities. In the other provisions contingencies amounting to a high eightfigure sum have been set aside to cover fines imposed based on the proceedings conducted by the public prosecutors office in Hanover in connection with illegal defeat devices in diesel engines.

1019,Financial instruments allocated to the FVOCIwoR measurement category are classified as such because they are held over a long term for strategic purposes. For financial instruments accounted for at FVOCIwoR for which there are no quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments Level or for similar instruments or for which there are no applicable measurement methods in which all major input factors are based on observable market data Level the fair value must be calculated using a measurement method for which the major input factors are based on nonobservable market data Level . If external valuation reports or information from other financing rounds is available these are used. If such information is not available the measurement is performed according to the measurement method that is deemed appropriate and realizable in each case for example according to the discounted cash flow method or by valuation according to multiples using ratios based on purchase prices for comparable transactions. Measurement at amortized cost is only considered the best estimate of the fair value of financial assets if the most recent information available for fair value measurement is insufficient. Financial instruments accounted for at FVOCIwoR are centrally monitored with regard to any changes to the major nonobservable input factors and continuously checked for changes in value. Please see Note for information on the changes in carrying amounts of other investments. For reasons of materiality a sensitivity analysis is not required. The accounting and measurement methods applied are described in Note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The fair values of other indebtedness were derived from existing quotations on an active market Level or alternatively were determined by discounting all future cash flows at the applicable interest rates for the corresponding residual maturities taking into account a companyspecific credit spread Level provided their carrying amounts as at the reporting date are not approximately equivalent to their fair values. The other financial instruments measured at cost generally have short remaining terms. As a result the carrying amounts as at the end of the reporting period are as a rule approximately their fair values and are not shown in the fair value hierarchy in the table.

Dividend income from financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income is explained under Income from Investments Note . Collateral As at December a total of . million PY . million of financial assets had been pledged as collateral. In the year under review as in the previous year collateral mainly consisted of trade accounts receivable assigned as collateral for liabilities from saleofreceivables programs. The remainder related to pledged cash or other financial assets. Risk management of financial instruments Due to its international business activities and the resulting financing requirements the Continental Group is exposed to default risks risks from changes in exchanges rates and variable interest rates and liquidity risk. The management of these risks is described in the following sections. In addition hedging instruments are used in the Continental Group. Their use is covered by corporatewide policies adherence to which is regularly reviewed by internal auditors. Internal settlement risks are minimized through the clear segregation of functional areas. Further information about the risks presented below and about risk management can be found in the report on risks and opportunities in the consolidated management report. . Default risks Default risks from trade accounts receivable contract assets or other financial assets include the risk that receivables will be collected late or not at all if a customer or another contractual party does not fulfill its contractual obligations. The total of the positive carrying amounts is equivalent to the maximum default risk of the Continental Group from financial assets. Default risk is influenced mainly by characteristics of the customers and the sector and is therefore analyzed and monitored by central and local credit managers. The responsibilities of the credit management function also include pooled receivables risk management. Contractual partners creditworthiness and payment history are analyzed on a regular basis. Default risk for nonderivative financial receivables is also limited by ensuring that agreements are entered into with partners with proven creditworthiness only or that collateral is provided or in individual cases trade credit insurance is agreed. The Continental Group held an immaterial amount of collateral as at December . There are no trade accounts receivable or contract assets for which an impairment loss was not recognized due to collateral held. However default risk cannot be excluded with absolute certainty and any remaining risk is addressed by recognizing expected credit losses for identified individual risks and on the basis of experience taking account of any relevant future components. Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired accordingly have a prime credit rating. Default risks are calculated on the basis of corporatewide standards. The methods for calculating loss allowances are described in Note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Trade accounts receivable and contract assets If the creditworthiness of receivables is impaired corresponding expenses are recognized in an allowance account. Lifetime expected credit losses are largely calculated using estimates and assessments based on the creditworthiness of the respective customer current economic developments and the analysis of historical losses on receivables. The creditworthiness of a customer is assessed on the basis of its payment history and its ability to make payments. It is regularly reviewed whether there is a need to take account of any risks in connection with different customer groups sectors or countries. No such allocation of default risk was required in . Continental calculates the default rates for lifetime expected credit losses based on a threeyear average taking account of the historical defaults allocated to the different periods past due and generally also taking account of a forwardlooking component. Trade accounts receivable and contract assets whose creditworthiness is already impaired are not taken into account when calculating lifetime expected credit losses. There were no significant effects on expected credit losses from the modification of cash flows. ,,,,0.36667749857828696,,0.3358089164521953,0.4887416355963405,0.422451719890292,0.3716180937698829,0.31706103591480794,0.47141926335548767,,0.3024815863680621,0.36700863866486083,,,,,0.3643252238210538

1029,As at December loss allowances for trade accounts receivable whose creditworthiness was impaired amounted to . million PY . million. Of the impaired receivables written down in the reporting period . million PY . million is still subject to enforcement measures. Other financial assets Loss allowances equivalent to the gross carrying amount totaling . million PY . million were recognized for other financial assets whose creditworthiness was impaired. Other month and lifetime expected credit losses on other financial assets are not of significance. Cash and cash equivalents derivative instruments and interestbearing investments In order to minimize the default risk for cash and cash equivalents derivative instruments and interestbearing investments the Continental Group generally uses banks that it has classified as core banks on the basis of defined criteria. As a general rule these banks should have at least one investmentgrade credit rating from one of the global rating agencies. The default risk can therefore be considered very low. The creditworthiness of the core banks and of other banks and other business partners with which investments are made loans are granted or derivative instruments are traded in derogation from the core bank principle for operational or regulatory reasons is continuously monitored by tracking not only their credit ratings but also particularly the premiums for insuring against credit risks credit default swap CDS provided such information is available. In addition the Continental Group sets investment limits for each bank and trading limits for derivative instruments. The amount of these limits is based on the creditworthiness of the respective bank. Compliance with these limits is continuously monitored. As in the previous year expected credit losses from cash and cash equivalents and other interestbearing investments measured at amortized cost as well as assets measured at amortized cost with impaired creditworthiness are not significant. . Currency management The international nature of the Continental Groups business activities results in deliveries and payments in various currencies. Currencyexchange fluctuations involve the risk of losses because assets denominated in currencies with a falling exchange rate lose value while liabilities denominated in currencies with a rising exchange rate become more expensive. For hedging it is allowed to use only derivative instruments that have been defined in corporatewide policies and can be reported and measured in the treasury management system. It is generally not permitted to use financial instruments that do not meet these criteria. ,,,,0.3654545642837416,,,0.48278836145284715,0.4012450630000453,0.30959388520504433,,0.43104203707479527,,,,,,,,0.3617922796053944

1062,Continental AG and its subsidiaries are involved in lawsuits regulatory investigations and proceedings worldwide. Such lawsuits investigations and proceedings could also be initiated or claims asserted in other ways in the future. Product liability In particular Continental is constantly subject to product liability and other claims in which the company is accused of the alleged infringement of its duty of care violations against warranty obligations or defects of material or workmanship. Claims from alleged breaches of contract resulting from product recalls or government proceedings are also asserted. Among other cases claimants in the USA file lawsuits for property damage personal injury and death caused by alleged defects in our products. Claims for material and nonmaterial damages and in some cases punitive damages are asserted. The outcome of individual proceedings which are generally decided by a jury in a court of first instance cannot be predicted with certainty. No assurance can be given that Continental will not incur substantial expenses as a result of the final judgments or settlements in some of these cases or that these amounts will not exceed any provisions set up for these claims. Some subsidiaries in the USA are exposed to relatively limited claims for damages from purported health injuries allegedly caused by products containing asbestos. The total costs for dealing with all such claims and proceedings have amounted to less than million per year since . Disputes over industrial property rights Continental could be liable to pay compensation for infringements or could be forced to purchase licenses to continue using technology from third parties. Continental for example supplies telecommunication modules that transmit vehicle data enable voice and internet functionality and are compatible with cellular communication standards. In this respect there is a risk that Continental or its suppliers may be denied their own direct license to use patents relating to these standards standard essential patents especially in the field of telecommunications standards such as G G or G and that Continental may become dependent on licenses and the conditions under which they are granted to customers. Continental has formed provisions to cover the risks in this regard. In accordance with IAS . and GAS . no further disclosures will be made so as not to adversely affect the companys interests. Regulatory proceedings In May the Brazilian competition authorities opened investigations against Continentals Brazilian subsidiary Continental Brasil Industria Automotiva Ltda. Guarulhos Brazil CBIA following a complaint of anticompetitive behavior in the area of commercialization of tachographs. On August the Brazilian antitrust authorities determined an invitation to cartel and imposed a fine of BRL million around . million on CBIA which was then reduced to BRL . million around . million. CBIA denies the accusation that it has infringed Brazilian antitrust law. Although the court of first instance appealed to by CBIA upheld the decision on CBIAs further appeal the next higher court annulled this decision and remanded the matter. In February the court of first instance rendered a verdict against CBIA and lifted the ban on the enforcement of the financial penalty against CBIA at that time an amount of BRL . million around . million. CBIA filed a motion for clarification requesting that the preliminary injunction against enforcement remain in full force up until a final and unappealable ruling is made. This motion was denied and CBIA filed an appeal against this decision. In case an infringement of Brazilian antitrust law is found third parties may in addition claim damages from CBIA. On October South African antitrust authorities received a complaint from a third party accusing several South African tire manufacturers of alleged antitrust behavior including Continental Tyre South Africa Pty. Ltd. Port Elizabeth South Africa CTSA a subsidiary of Continental. On August the South African antitrust authorities came to the conclusion that CTSA had violated South African antitrust law and referred the matter to the responsible antitrust court for a decision. CTSA denies the allegation of infringements of South African antitrust law. However the tribunal could impose a fine of up to of CTSAs sales. In addition third parties may also claim damages from CTSA in case of an infringement of South African competition law. As a result of investigations by the US Department of Justice DOJ and the Korea Fair Trade Commission KFTC in connection with the suspected involvement in violations of US and South Korean antitrust law in the instrument cluster business which came to light in the KFTC imposed a fine on Continental Automotive Electronics LLC Bugangmyeon South Korea CAE at the end of the final amount of which was set in at KRW million around . million. In the USA CAE and Continental Automotive Korea Ltd. Seongnamsi South Korea agreed to pay a fine of US . million approximately . million in . In the proceedings relating to class action lawsuits filed in the USA and Canada for alleged damages resulting from the antitrust violations settlements totaling US . million around . million were concluded in the USA in and settlements totaling CAN . million around . million concluded in Canada in . The risk of investigations by other antitrust authorities into this matter and claims for damages by further alleged victims remain unaffected by the fines imposed. As a result of investigations that came to light in the European Commission imposed a fine of . million on Continental AG Continental Teves AG Co. oHG Frankfurt am Main Germany and Continental Automotive GmbH Hanover Germany on February for the unlawful exchange of information. This involved specific brake components. Continental has paid this fine. Customers have since approached Continental to claim for damages in some cases for specific amounts. MercedesBenz Group AG filed for declaratory judgment action with the Hanover District Court against Continental AG and two other companies of the Continental Group in December . In April several companies of the Stellantis Group as well as several companies of the Renault Group filed a civil lawsuit in each case against Continental AG and three other companies of the Continental Group before the High ,,,,0.3488900541204827,,,,,,0.29633036164434046,,,,,,,,,

1067,As in previous years contingent liabilities related to guarantees for the liabilities of affiliated companies and third parties not included in consolidation and to contractual warranties. To the best of our knowledge the underlying obligations will be fulfilled in all cases. Utilization is not anticipated. Risks from taxation and customs constitute potential future burdens arising from matters related to income tax sales tax and customs law. During the reporting period Italian tax authorities opened criminal tax investigations into three Italian companies of the Continental Group. The investigations relate to a possible failure by the units concerned to comply with reporting and declaration requirements visvis the Italian tax authorities. Financial charges in the form of back taxes penalties and fines as well as interest payments are not implausible. Due to the complexity of the facts presented by the Italian authorities and the early stage of the investigations it is not possible to reliably estimate the possible financial charges. The other financial obligations relate in part to the acquisition of companies now owned by the Continental Group. The Continental Group could be subject to obligations relating to environmental issues under governmental laws and regulations or as a result of various claims and proceedings that are pending or that might be made or initiated against it. Estimates of future expenses in this area are naturally subject to many uncertainties such as the enactment of new laws and regulations the development and application of new technologies and the identification of contaminated land or buildings for which the Continental Group is legally liable. In connection with the carveout of Vitesco Technologies individual customers of the Vitesco Technologies Group were granted contract performance guarantees valid until December . To the best of our knowledge the companies concerned will be able to fulfill the underlying obligations in all cases. Utilization is not anticipated. Open purchase commitments for property plant and equipment amounted to . million PY . million. ,,,,,0.3383555281028445,0.34441667409012056,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1078,Remuneration of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board The remuneration of the Continental Groups key management personnel that must be disclosed in accordance with IAS Related Party Disclosures comprises the remuneration of the active members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. The remuneration of the active members of the Executive Board in the respective years was as follows ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3160049520233785,,,
1080,The total remuneration of the members of the Executive Board comprises a number of remuneration components. These include a remuneration component that is unrelated to performance including specific additional benefits and entitlement to a company pension and a variable component that is based on performance consisting of a shortterm remuneration component and longterm remuneration components. Additional benefits include i provision of a company car which can also be for personal use ii reimbursement of travel expenses as well as relocation costs and expenses for running a second household where this is required for work reasons iii a regular health check iv directors and officers DO liability insurance with deductible in accordance with Section Sentence AktG v accident insurance vi the employers liability insurance association contribution including where necessary income tax incurred as a result as well as vii health insurance and longterm care insurance contributions based on Section of Book V of the German Social Code SGB V and Section of Book XI of the German Social Code SGB XI. In accordance with their future benefit rights each member of the Executive Board is granted postemployment benefits that are paid starting at the age of but not before they leave the service of Continental AG hereinafter insured event. From January the company pension for the members of the Executive Board was changed to a defined contribution commitment. A capital component is credited to the Executive Board members pension account each year. To determine this a fixed contribution agreed by the Supervisory Board in the Executive Board members service agreement is multiplied by an age factor that represents an appropriate return. For members of the Executive Board who were already in office prior to January the future benefit rights accrued until December have been converted into a starting component in the capital account. When the insured event occurs the benefits are paid out as a lump sum in installments or as is normally the case due to the expected amount of the benefits as a pension. Postemployment benefits must be adjusted after commencement of such benefit payments by p.a. in accordance with Section No. of the German Company Pensions Law Betriebsrentengesetz BetrAVG. The variable components that are based on performance comprise a shortterm remuneration component performance bonus without equity deferral as well as longterm remuneration components longterm incentive and equity deferral of the performance bonus. For the variable remuneration components before the start of each fiscal year target criteria are determined by the Supervisory Board with a view to its strategic goals the provisions of Sections and a AktG and the German Corporate Governance Code in its respective valid version whereby the degree to which these criteria are met will determine the actual amount paid out. The Supervisory Board may take the function and area of responsibility of the individual members of the Executive Board into account with regard to the amount of the total targetbased remuneration. As part of this shares of the individual remuneration component for the total targetbased remuneration are indicated below in percentage ranges. The precise proportions therefore vary depending on the functional differentiation as well as a possible change within the framework of the yearly remuneration review. The fixed annual salary comprises to of the target remuneration the performance bonus excluding equity deferral between and and the equity deferral and longterm incentive between and . Future benefit rights make up between and of the target remuneration and additional benefits make up approximately .
