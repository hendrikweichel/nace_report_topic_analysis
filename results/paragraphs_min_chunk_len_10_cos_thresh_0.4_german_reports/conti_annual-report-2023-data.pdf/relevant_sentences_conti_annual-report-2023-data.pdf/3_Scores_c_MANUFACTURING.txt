We allocated all economic activities involved in the manufacture of rail rolling stock constituents to category .. This classification is based in particular on the fact that from Continentals perspective the reference to activity . does not impose any restrictions on components in relation to the function or drive system of rail vehicles for which the components are manufactured provided that the components and systems are necessary for the operation and functioning of rail vehicles. Furthermore the activity designation does not entail any restrictions on components for example in relation to function or drive system. In contrast to the previous year in the reporting year all activities involved in tire manufacturing were classified as Taxonomyeligible under category .. In Recital of Delegated Regulation amending Delegated Regulation the Commission made it clear that tire manufacturing has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector and can contribute to a more circular economy. Until specific technical assessment criteria are defined for this activity tire manufacturing shall remain a Taxonomyeligible activity under category . Manufacture of other lowcarbon technologies. It is Continentals opinion that this clarification for the purposes of Taxonomy eligibility refers to the manufacture of tires of all kinds without any restrictions in terms of specific properties label classes or drive system technologies. Based on this clarification Continental has amended its approach compared with the previous year and now allocates the manufacture of tires of all kinds without any restrictions in terms of specific properties label classes or drive system technologies to category .. Alternative interpretations were also examined here but they were found to be unsuitable by Continental particularly with regard to Recital . In addition various Continental industrial businesses will continue to be reported as Taxonomyeligible as they were in the previous year. In the reporting year these primarily comprised the manufacture of components for wind turbines and the manufacture of materials for industrial plant insulation. Continental still allocates these businesses to category . Manufacture of other lowcarbon technologies since the economic activities pursue substantial reductions and therefore make significant contributions to the expansion of renewable energies and energy saving for example through insulation in industrial plants. For these classifications as well Continental believes it is irrelevant which functions are fulfilled by the supplier technologies in the end products as long as the end product facilitates the goals set out in Art. of the Taxonomy Regulation. The activities mentioned are not identified as Taxonomyeligible under Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act climate change adaptation. All other economic activities of the Continental Group that are not included in the aforementioned economic activities have been classified as Taxonomynoneligible for the reporting year. Accordingly Continental currently has not allocated any economic activities to the other environmental objectives under Annex I Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources Annex II Transition to a circular economy Annex III Pollution prevention and control or Annex IV Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. We base the classification on the information publicly available at the time the report was prepared. Taxonomyeligible turnover The information on turnover is prepared in accordance with section.. of Annex to the Delegated Regulation on Disclosure Obligations and in compliance with IFRS accounting regulations see tables at the end of this nonfinancial statement. The method of determination selected by Continental ensures that double counting is avoided. The described firsttime classification of all tire manufacturing activities as Taxonomyeligible under category . and the firsttime classification of all other economic activities involved in the manufacture of automotive and mobility systems and components for road vehicles as Taxonomyeligible under category . resulted in a significant increase in Taxonomyeligible turnover in the reporting year. Added to this was the firsttime classification of other economic activities involved in the manufacture of rail rolling stock constituents as Taxonomyeligible under category .. In addition various Continental industrial businesses were reported as Taxonomyeligible under category . as they were in the previous year. A total sum of .billion was reported as Taxonomyeligible turnover in the reporting year PY .billion equivalent to . of total consolidated sales PY .. The breakdown of Taxonomyeligible turnover by category is shown in the table on page. Information on the Continental Groups total turnover the denominator of the key figure calculation can be found in the consolidated statement of income of this annual report under Sales. Taxonomyeligible capital expenditure and operating expenditure Taxonomyeligible capital expenditure and operating expenditure have been recorded in accordance with the Delegated Regulation on Disclosure Obligations and taking into account the clarifications made by the European Commission in October. The figures for Taxonomyeligible capital expenditure and operating expenditure under category a are allocations based on the proportion of Taxonomyeligible turnover. For reasons connected to the business model the equipment machinery and buildings of the Continental Group are thus used both for Taxonomyeligible activities and for other activities. This applies both to capital expenditure and operating expenditure for assets or processes associated with Taxonomyeligible activities category a. The allocation takes place at group sector level and not according to the individual locations in order to avoid double counting take into account internal business and consolidation effects and reflect the Continental Groups matrix structure. This allocation of turnover thus reflects the distribution of Continentals production. The Platform on Sustainable Finance also recommends such an approach to allocation in its report to the Commission dated October. This states for enabling activities that capital expenditure and operating expenditure should be reported on the basis of their proportion of turnover provided the activities are Taxonomyeligible and that they not do not include activities that are Taxonomynoneligible.

Compared with previous years the development of raw materials markets in the year under review was largely stable due to an overall improvement in availability. Global supply chains also returned to more normal levels. This was also reflected in less volatile price developments particularly for metals. Although a decline in price volatility was observed for products such as crude oil and butadiene prices still fluctuated significantly in some cases. Overall however they were roughly on a par with the level seen at the start of at the end of the reporting period. Carbon steel and stainless steel are input materials for many of the mechanical components such as diecast parts integrated by Continental into its products. Steel wire is used in particular in tire production as steel cord but also in conveyor belts and timing belts to increase tensile strength.

Description of sales revenue in industrial and replacement business The type of performance obligations to customers in industrial and replacement business relates to the replacementtire and retail business of the Tires segment the industrial and retail business of the ContiTech segment and the replacementparts and retail business of the Automotive and Contract Manufacturing segments please refer to the information provided on the group sectors in the Structure of the Continental Group section of the consolidated management report. Invoices are generally prepared once a month while the payment terms for most of the sales average days and differ mostly depending on the region andor product group. Payments are made by bank transfer in the vast majority of cases with the exception of business with end customers and consumers who often pay in cash or by card. No significant discounts on the invoice amount are granted however customer bonuses and other price reductions are included in the transaction price as variable price components in line with expectations. The customers do not usually make any significant advance payments. Revenue is recognized at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer taking into account the agreed incoterms. There are no significant obligations from the right of customers to return products or from reimbursements to customers or similar obligations or from warranty commitments that include a service component. Description of revenue in other business activities Revenue in other business activities is included in the sales of the automotive originalequipment business in the sales of the industrial and replacement business and in other revenues. On the one hand services are provided and on the other project business is conducted in which developments for customers are made goods produced or services provided over a mediumterm or longer period. For this revenue there are no significant obligations from the right of customers to return products or from reimbursements to customers or similar obligations or from warranty commitments that include a service component. The largest component of this revenue relates to revenue from research and development which is recognized at a point in time either when the entire development is completed or when identifiable milestones within a development are reached. Invoices are generally prepared after completion of a milestone or an entire development and acceptance by the customer. Payments are made by bank transfer in most cases. No significant discounts on the invoice amount are granted. The customers do not usually make any significant advance payments. In addition services that are performed alongside the main business also lead to revenue recognition over time though in smaller amounts. Both input and outputbased measurement methods are used and sales are measured either based on the hours or days worked or the costs incurred input or based on the services rendered output. Invoices are generally prepared at least once a month and payments are made by bank transfer in most cases. No significant discounts on the invoice amount are granted. The customers do not usually make any significant advance payments. In addition project business is conducted in which generally customerspecific goods or services are produced or provided for customers over a mediumterm or longer period. Revenue from this is likewise recognized over time and sales are mostly measured using inputbased measurement methods taking account of the costs incurred. Invoices are generally issued as contractually agreed. Advance payments averaging are usually made by the customers before the start of a project. Payments are made by bank transfer in most cases. No significant discounts on the invoice amount are granted. Contract assets and contract liabilities Contract assets primarily arise in the project business from customerspecific goods or services for customers but are only of minor significance in the Continental Group. Contract assets must be recognized because the goods or services are provided over a mediumterm or longer period in which goods or services have already been provided by Continental but there is not yet an unconditional right against the customer i.e. a receivable. The right or part of the right to consideration from the customer is often only unconditional once the provision of the services has been completed and can then be recognized as a receivable and invoiced in full. The associated payments are generally made on the basis of actual invoicing. The recognition of receivables and the receipt of payments reduce the associated contract assets. Contract liabilities include mainly advance payments by customers for deliveries of goods and for services to be performed. In the case of these advance payments by customers for deliveries of goods and for services to be performed the customer has already paid the consideration or part of the consideration but Continental has generally not yet satisfied its performance obligation or has done so only to a limited extent. The provision of the corresponding services to the customers by Continental reduces the level of the associated contract liabilities. Research and development expenses Research and development expenses comprise expenditure on research and development and expenses for customerspecific applications prototypes and testing. Where refunds from customers for research and development expenses are agreed these costs are recognized in inventories until control is transferred. Once control is transferred the refund amounts are stated under other income. In addition the expenses are reduced by the amount relating to the application of research results from the development of new or substantially improved products if the related activity fulfills the recognition criteria for internally generated intangible assets set out in IAS Intangible Assets. This portion of the expenses is capitalized as an asset and amortized over a period of three to seven years from the date that the developed products become marketable. However expenses for customerspecific applications preproduction prototypes or tests for products already being marketed do not qualify as development expenditure which may be recognized as an intangible asset. Furthermore expenses incurred directly in connection with the launch of new production operations and plants are recognized directly in profit or loss.

Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems Publication of the Environmental Delegated Act under EU Taxonomy Regulation was accompanied by the introduction of amendments to the Climate Delegated Act comprising changes to the existing activities for the two climate objectives as well the inclusion of new economic activities for the two climate objectives. This affects among others the two economic activities of category . Manufacture of automotive and mobility components and category . Manufacture of rail rolling stock constituents. Furthermore the EU Commission made it explicit in Recital of Delegated Regulation amending Delegated Regulation that the activity of tire manufacturing because of its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector is a Taxonomyeligible activity that is currently to be allocated to category . Manufacture of other lowcarbon technologies. While the amendments to the Climate Delegated Act do clear up some existing ambiguities in terms of how the regulation is to be interpreted when it comes to the Taxonomy eligibility of Continentals economic activities reporting pursuant to the EU Taxonomy Regulation remains fraught with uncertainty for Continental. This is mainly because unclear wording continues to be used in the regulations and notes on determining Taxonomy eligibility and in particular Taxonomy alignment as well as the calculations for key performance indicators for turnover capital expenditure and operating expenditure as they pertain to the economic activities relevant for Continental. As a result these regulations and notes are still open to interpretation. From Continentals perspective there is also uncertainty about the interaction between the various regulations delegated acts and official answers to frequently asked questions. Furthermore the short implementation period granted by the delegated act published in means that many questions of interpretation related to implementation have not yet been conclusively clarified. In interpreting the regulation we also take into consideration the assessments of industry associations in the supplier and automotive industries the reporting practices of European suppliers for and unofficial assessments by various experts.

As part of our sustainability ambition we strive for carbon neutrality and emissionfree mobility and industry by at the latest see also the sections on carbon neutrality and on emissionfree mobility and industry in this combined nonfinancial statement and thus for the expansion of clean and carbonneutral mobility. With this in mind we have introduced performance indicators at a corporate level as part of our sustainability scorecard with the aim of monitoring our progress. In the previous year we used this scorecard to classify the allocated business with emissionfree mobility and industry as the indicator that comprises all economic activities to be disclosed for Continental as Taxonomyeligible with respect to the environmental target of climate change mitigation in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation. It consisted of allocated business with zerotailpipeemission vehicles and allocated lowcarbon business beyond business with zerotailpipeemission vehicles. This business was therefore classified under category . Manufacture of other lowcarbon technologies of the Delegated Regulation for Climate Change Mitigation EU Annex I in the previous year since at the time no general regulations or specific upstream economic activities were provided for. The introduction of category . Manufacture of automotive and mobility components and category . Manufacture of rail rolling stock constituents coupled with the updated approach to the activity of tire manufacturing resulted in the reclassification of various Continental economic activities reported as Taxonomyeligible in the reporting year compared with as well as a significant increase in sales capital expenditure and operating expenditure. In the reporting year we allocated all economic activities involved in the manufacture of automotive and mobility systems and components for road vehicles with the exception of tires but also extending beyond components for zerotailpipeemission vehicles to category .. Continental is of the opinion that the manufacture of all components irrespective of the drive system is Taxonomyeligible for all vehicles belonging to the vehicle classes listed in the category. This classification is based on the fact that from Continentals perspective the activity designation does not entail any restrictions in terms of components for example in relation to function or drive system and the corresponding components parts and systems are intended for use in road vehicles. The unclearly defined qualification characteristic criterion of activity . essential contribution to environmental performance is in Continentals view part of the assessment of Taxonomy alignment and not Taxonomy eligibility. Alternative interpretations were examined but they were found to be unsuitable by Continental.

As in the previous year Continental did not report any economic activities as being Taxonomyaligned. For all economic activities that are reported under category . specific comparative lifecycle assessments are required in order to also report these as being Taxonomyaligned. These must demonstrate substantial savings to lifecycle emissions compared with the highestperforming alternative technology or solution available on the market or the highestperforming alternative product available on the market. External verification of the lifecycle assessments must also take place in accordance with predefined standards. A simplified lifecycle consideration as called for by the Taxonomy Regulation itself is no longer sufficient in accordance with the Delegated Regulation for Climate Change Mitigation for category .. Continental did not have the corresponding lifecycle assessments at its disposal in the reporting year meaning it is currently not possible to allocate Taxonomyaligned economic activities. For this reason the Do No Significant Harm DNSH criteria and the minimum protection requirements along the value chain were not assessed according to specific economic activities. It was not yet mandatory in the reporting year to report Taxonomyaligned economic activities if the economic activities are reported according to the categories . and . which have been newly integrated into the Climate Delegated Act. Since Continental does not currently report any activities as Taxonomyaligned no Taxonomyaligned capital expenditure or operating expenditure according to categories a and b has been reported. Since no Taxonomyeligible capital expenditure or operating expenditure under category c was identified no Taxonomyaligned capital expenditure or operating expenditure under category c has been reported.

Our ambition As set out in our sustainability ambition we are recognized by our customers and society as being a benchmark in quality by ensuring safe and sustainable products. Concept The decisive factor in becoming a benchmark in quality is a qualityoriented company culture. Our quality policy sets out guidelines for product and process quality at Continental. Product recalls product liability claims and proceedings as a result of quality defects represent a business risk that we want to avoid due to the resulting losses of sales costs and loss of customer and market acceptance. For more information see the report on risks and opportunities in this annual report. Local management systems drive forward the implementation of these guidelines. The concrete organizational and technical requirements can be found in the relevant quality management manuals for the group sectors. The extent of the certifications is assessed on an annual basis as to how many employees they cover with respect to quality management systems. The number of new field quality events is used as an effectiveness indicator for our quality management. A field quality event is a riskminimizing measure for a product manufactured andor sold by Continental on the basis of a safetyrelated defect andor noncompliance with regulations that was initiated by Continental a customer andor an authority. The Group Quality Technical Compliance Continental Business System CBS and Environment group function as well as the quality functions at various levels in the Continental Group which work together in a global network are responsible for the strategic corporatewide quality management process.

New developments for the originalequipment business are not marketable until Continental AG has been nominated as the supplier for the particular vehicle platform or model and furthermore has successfully fulfilled preproduction release stages. Moreover these release stages serve as the prerequisite to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the product especially given the high demands imposed on safety and comfort technology. Accordingly development costs are recognized as an asset only as at the date of nomination as supplier and upon fulfillment of a specific pre production release stage. The development is considered to be completed once the final approval for the unlimited production is granted. Only very few development projects fulfill the recognition criteria. Although suppliers are nominated by original equipment manufacturers with the general obligation to supply products over the entire life of the particular model or platform these supply agreements constitute neither longterm contracts nor firm commitments in particular because the original equipment manufacturers make no commitments in regard to purchase quantities. For this reason all preproduction expenses with the exception of the capitalized development costs as previously described are recognized immediately in profit or loss. Productrelated expenses Costs for advertising sales promotion and other salesrelated items are expensed as incurred. Provisions are recognized for possible warranty claims on sold products on the basis of past experience as well as legal and contractual terms. Additional provisions are recognized for specific known cases. Financial result and investment income Interest income and expenses are recognized for the period to which they relate. Dividends are recognized in profit or loss if legal entitlement to payment of the dividend is established the economic benefit associated with the dividend is likely to be received and the dividend amount can be measured reliably. Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of shares issued. Treasury stock is deducted for the period it is held. Diluted earnings per share also include shares from the potential exercise of option or conversion rights. The corresponding expenses that would no longer be incurred after the conversion or exchange are eliminated. Statement of financial position classification Assets and liabilities are reported as noncurrent assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position if they have a remaining term of over one year and conversely as current assets and liabilities if the remaining term is shorter. Liabilities are treated as current if there is no unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least months after the end of the reporting period. Pension provisions provisions for other postemployment benefits and other employee benefits as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities are accounted for as noncurrent. If assets and liabilities have both current and noncurrent portions the amounts are classified separately and shown as current and noncurrent assets or liabilities. Goodwill Goodwill corresponds to the difference between the acquisition cost and the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities of the business combination. Goodwill is not subject to amortization it is tested for impairment at least annually and if necessary impaired. The details of the annual impairment test are described under Impairment in this note. Once an impairment loss has been recognized on goodwill it is not reversed in subsequent periods. Intangible assets Purchased intangible assets are carried at acquisition costs and internally generated intangible assets at their production costs provided that the conditions for recognition of an internally generated intangible asset are met in accordance with IAS Intangible Assets. If intangible assets have finite useful lives they are amortized on a straightline basis over a useful life of three to eight years in general. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested at least annually for impairment and if necessary impaired. The details of the annual impairment test are described under Impairment in this note. Property plant and equipment Property plant and equipment is measured at cost less straightline depreciation. If necessary additional impairment is recognized on the affected items. Production cost consists of the direct costs and attributable material and manufacturing overheads including depreciation. Under certain conditions portions of the borrowing costs are capitalized as part of the acquisition cost. This also applies to finance leases and investment property. As soon as an asset is available for its intended use subsequent cost is capitalized only to the extent the related modification changes the function of the asset or increases its economic value and the cost can be clearly identified. All other subsequent expenditure is recognized as current maintenance expense. Property plant and equipment is broken down into the lowest level of the components that have significantly different useful lives and to the extent integrated in other assets when they are likely to be replaced or overhauled during the overall life of the related main asset. Maintenance and repair costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. The Continental Group has no property plant or equipment that by the nature of its operation and deployment can be repaired and serviced only in intervals over several years. The useful lives are up to years for buildings and land improvements up to years for technical equipment and machinery and up to years for operating and office equipment.

The costs of customerspecific applications preproduction prototypes and testing for products already being sold do not qualify as development expenditure that may be recognized as an intangible asset. Capitalized development expenses are amortized on a straightline basis over a useful life of three to seven years and recognized in the cost of sales.

In accordance with the provisions of IFRS Operating Segments Continental AGs segment reporting is based on the management approach with regard to segment identification under which information regularly provided to the chief operating decisionmaker for decisionmaking purposes is considered decisive. The activities of the Continental Group are divided into the following segments Automotive offers technologies for safety brake chassis motion and motioncontrol systems. Its portfolio also includes innovative solutions for assisted and automated driving display and operating technologies audio and camera solutions for the vehicle interior as well as intelligent information and communication technology associated with the mobility services of fleet operators and commercial vehicle manufacturers. Comprehensive activities relating to vehicle connectivity architecture and electronics as well as highperformance computers and software solutions round off the range of products and services. With its premium portfolio in the car truck bus twowheel and specialty tire segment Tires stands for innovative solutions in tire technology. Intelligent products and services related to tires and the promotion of sustainability complete the portfolio. For specialist dealers and fleet management Tires offers digital tire monitoring and tire management systems in addition to other services with the aim of keeping fleets mobile and increasing their efficiency. With its tires Continental contributes to safe efficient and environmentally friendly mobility. ContiTech focuses on development and materials expertise in products and systems made from rubber plastic metal and textiles which can also be equipped with electronic components to optimize their functionality for custom service applications. ContiTechs industrial growth areas are primarily in energy agriculture and construction as well as interior design. ContiTech also serves the automotive and transportation industries along with the railway engineering sector. The contract manufacturing of products by Continental companies for Vitesco Technologies is consolidated in Contract Manufacturing. This contract manufacturing is not intended to be a permanent situation rather the operational separation of production will continue to be promoted and the volume of contract manufacturing reduced. These segments correspond to the group sectors as defined in the Structure of the Continental Group section of the consolidated management report. Otherholdingconsolidation This comprises centrally managed subsidiaries and affiliates such as holding financing and insurance companies as well as the holding function of Continental AG and certain effects of consolidation. It also contains the effects on earnings of uncertain risks particularly those in connection with contractual and similar claims or obligations representing among other things risks from investments that cannot currently be assigned to the individual operating units. Internal control and reporting within the Continental Group are based on International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as described in Note . The Continental Group measures the performance of its segments on the basis of their adjusted operating result adjusted EBIT. Their performance is expressed as the return on sales adjusted EBIT divided by adjusted sales and as the return on capital employed ROCE which represents EBIT as a percentage of average operating assets. Intersegment sales and other proceeds are determined at arms length prices. For administrative services performed by centrally operated companies or by the Continental Groups management costs are calculated on an arms length basis in line with utilization. Where direct allocation is not possible costs are assigned according to the services performed. The segment assets comprise the operating assets of the assets side of the statement of financial position as at the end of the reporting period. The segment liabilities show the operating asset parts on the liabilities side of the statement of financial position. Capital expenditure relates to additions to property plant and equipment and software as well as additions to capitalized rightofuse assets in line with IFRS Leases and additions to capitalized borrowing costs in line with IAS Borrowing Costs. Depreciation and amortization include the scheduled diminution of and the impairment on intangible assets property plant and equipment capitalized rightofuse assets and investment properties as well as the impairment on goodwill. This figure does not include impairment on financial investments. Noncash expensesincome mainly include additions to and reversals of pension and warranty provisions as well as provisions for litigation and environmental risks. In the segment information broken down by country and region sales are allocated on the basis of the domicile of the respective customers in contrast capital expenditure and segment assets are allocated on the basis of the domicile of the respective companies.

Our ambition As set out in our sustainability ambition we strive for responsible sourcing and business partnerships by at the latest together with our partners along the value chain. Our understanding of a responsible value chain thus refers to our supply chain and customer relationships and to our own locations. Of central importance for our ambition are the requirements and speed of transformation of our customers industries and markets as well as the resulting transformation opportunities and risks. ConceptContinental operates in complex global value chains that are exposed to a variety of risks associated with the violation of protected rights. Risks within this context are always related to the potential negative impact on people and the environment. Continental has therefore established a comprehensive management system for ensuring its due diligence obligations in order to identify risks in connection with defined protected rights within its supply chain and in its own business units. For this purpose responsibilities rules and processes have been clearly defined for this purpose including riskmitigation measures and control mechanisms. The responsible value chain due diligence system RVCDDS focuses on the protected rights defined by us and will be developed further in line with the development of dynamic economic social and environmental requirements. The RVCDDS applies to ContinentalAG and to all subsidiaries in which the Continental Group exercises a controlling influence. The Executive Board of ContinentalAG is updated on the current status by the Continental Groups human rights officer at least once a year and decides on the systems effectiveness appropriateness and potential for improvement. It then proposes any suitable improvements to the RVCDDS where necessary either to the system as a whole or to selected elements. The RVCDDS is additionally integrated into Continentals overarching internal control system risk management system and compliance management system. As a key prevention measure at corporate level Continental has adopted responsible value chain commitments RVC commitments that are accessible online at www.continentalsustainability.com. These commitments address the defined risk categories and formulate what is expected of the companys own business units and employees as well as of its direct suppliers. The RVC commitments surpass the minimum legal requirements especially when it comes to working conditions. On top of this Continental has anchored further prevention measures in its own business units and with respect to direct suppliers. Within the RVCDDS our Code of Conduct defines the fundamental requirements for our employees while the Business Partner Code of Conduct defines the fundamental requirements among others for our suppliers as well as their suppliers with regard to human rights working conditions environmental protection conflict minerals and anticorruption. The Business Partner Code of Conduct is updated regularly most recently in fiscal to reflect changes or adjustments to relevant legislation. For suppliers of natural rubber our sourcing policy for sustainable natural rubber additionally applies. The existing corporatewide whistleblower system within ContinentalAG the Continental Integrity Hotline was expanded as part of the legal requirements under the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz and is available both to employees within the Continental Group as well as persons outside the company. The Integrity Hotline is open for information on potential violations of human rights and environmental rights among other issues. Alongside the whistleblower system a range of other resources are used to investigate potential protected right violations and implement preventive and remedial measures where necessary. The RVCDDS additionally defines the framework for taking remedial measures within the companys own business units as well as toward direct suppliers and should the situation arise also toward indirect suppliers. Sustainability aspects are also taken into consideration at various other points in supplier management. For example selected suppliers are evaluated based on various criteria using selfassessment questionnaires which we collect via the generally accepted sustainability platforms for our industries such as EcoVadis and NQC. These questionnaires are reviewed annually at the corporate level. Selective local audits or other audit activities are also carried out for example in relation to the existence of management systems. We also continue to develop our approach for the responsible value chain in dialogue with external stakeholders and support the development of industrywide standards for example through our participation in industry dialogue with the German government on human rights in the automotive industry. Here we have worked in particular to cultivate a shared understanding of industry risks and due diligence requirements. We are also involved in initiatives and associations such as econsense the Responsible Business Alliance RBA and the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber GPSNR.

A discontinued operation can also be classified as held for sale under IFRS . A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The classification of a component of an entity as a discontinued operation is also appropriate in the case of classification as held for distribution provided the criteria are met. Financial instruments A financial instrument as defined in IAS Financial Instruments Presentation is a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. In the Continental Group a purchase or sale of financial assets or financial liabilities is recognized or derecognized at the settlement date. Financial assets Financial assets are recognized in the statement of financial position as at the date Continental becomes a contractual party to the financial instrument. At the acquisition date they must be classified into measurement categories that determine the subsequent accounting. Receivables from the receivables factoring programs carried out in the Continental Group are recognized in the statement of financial position when the risks and rewards in particular credit and default risk have not been essentially transferred. The repayment obligations therefrom are as a rule then shown as shortterm financial liabilities. The classification and measurement of financial assets that constitute debt instruments is based on the business model in which the assets are managed and on their cash flow characteristics. These conditions are cumulative criteria whose audit sequence is irrelevant. It is therefore necessary to analyze the business model in which the asset to be classified is held. This relates to the investigation of the way in which financial assets held in order to collect cash flows are managed. The Continental Group reclassifies debt instruments if the corresponding business model changes. IFRS Financial Instruments distinguishes between three business models

The necessary funding is determined every three years through technical valuations in line with local provisions. The obligations are measured using a discount rate based on government bonds and other conservatively selected actuarial assumptions. Compared with IAS which derives the discount rate from senior corporate bonds this usually results in a higher obligation. Three of the four defined benefit plans had a funding deficit on the basis of the most recent technical valuation. The trustees and the company have agreed on a recovery plan that provides for additional temporary annual payments. The valuation process must be completed within months of the valuation date. The most recent technical valuations of the four defined benefit pension plans took place with their valuation dates between December and March and led to the following result

Some prior commitments were granted through two legally independent pension contribution funds. Pensionskasse für Angestellte der Continental Aktiengesellschaft VVaG and Pensionskasse von der Phoenix AG VVaG have been closed since March and July respectively. The pension contribution funds are smaller associations within the meaning of Section of the German Insurance Supervision Act Versicherungsaufsichts gesetz VAG and are subject to the supervision of the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht. The investment regulations are in accordance with the legal requirements and risk structure of the obligations. The pension contribution funds have tariffs with an interest rate of . or .. Under the German Company Pensions Law Betriebsrentengesetz BetrAVG Continental is ultimately liable for the implementation path of the pension contribution fund. In accordance with IAS Employee Benefits the pension obligations covered by the pension contribution fund are therefore defined benefit pension plans. The pension contribution funds met their minimum net funding requirement as at December . However given that only the plan members are entitled to the assets and amounts generated the benefit obligations are recognized in the same amount as the existing assets at fair value. Continental also supports private contribution through deferred compensation schemes. Deferred compensation is essentially offered through a fully funded multiemployer plan Höchster Pensionskasse VVaG for contributions up to of the assessment ceiling in social security. The pension contribution fund ensures guaranteed minimum interest for which Continental is ultimately liable under the German Company Pensions Law. The company is not liable for guarantees to employees of other companies. As Höchster Pensionskasse VVaG is a combined defined benefit plan for several companies and Continental has no right to the information required for accounting for this defined benefit plan this plan is recognized as a defined contribution plan. Entitled employees can use the cash balance plan for deferred compensation contributions above the assessment ceiling. This share is funded by insurance annuity contracts. USA Owing to its acquisition history Continental has various defined benefit plans in the USA which were closed to new entrants and frozen to accretion of further benefits in a period from April to December . In acquisitions also included an open defined benefit plan for unionized employees. The closed defined benefit plans are commitments on the basis of the average final salary and cash balance commitments. The defined benefit plans for unionized and nonunionized employees are based on a pension multiplier per year of service. Closed defined benefit plans were replaced by defined contribution plans. Defined contribution plans apply to the majority of active employees in the USA. Due to the rise in interest rates further efforts are currently being made to push for additional funding. The plan assets of the defined benefit plans are managed in a master trust. Investment supervision was delegated to the Pension Committee a body appointed within the Continental Group. The legal and regulatory framework for the plans is based on the US Employee Retirement Income Security Act ERISA. The valuation of the financing level is required on the basis of this law. The interest rate used for this calculation is the average rate over a period of years and therefore currently higher than the interest rate used to discount obligations under IAS . The statutory valuation therefore gives rise to a lower obligation than that in line with IAS . There is a regulatory requirement to ensure minimum funding of in the defined benefit plans to prevent benefit curtailments. United Kingdom Continental maintains four defined benefit plans as a result of its history of acquisitions in the United Kingdom. All plans are commitments on the basis of the average or final salary. The four plans were closed to new employees in the period between April and November . Continental offers defined contribution plans for all employees who have joined the company since that time. As at April the Continental Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme was frozen to accretion of further benefits. It was replaced by a defined contribution plan as at April . As at July the Mannesmann UK Pension Scheme was frozen to accretion of further benefits. It was replaced by a defined contribution plan as at August . Our pension strategy in the UK focuses on reducing risks and includes the option of partial or complete funding by purchasing annuities. The rise in interest rates and the good funded status currently present opportunities to push for partial or complete funding. The receptivity of the insurance market is currently limited. The funding conditions are defined by the UK Pensions Regulator and the corresponding laws and regulations. The defined benefit plans are managed by trust companies. The boards of trustees of these companies have an obligation solely to the good of the beneficiaries on the basis of the trust agreement and the law.

Longterm employee benefits Pension plans In addition to statutory pension insurance the majority of employees are also entitled to defined benefit or defined contribution plans after the end of their employment. Our pension strategy is focusing on switching from defined benefit to defined contribution plans in order to offer both employees and the company a sustainable and readily understandable pension system. Many defined benefit plans have been closed for new employees or future service and replaced by defined contribution plans. In countries in which defined contribution plans are not possible for legal or economic reasons defined benefit plans have been optimized or changed to minimize the associated risks of longevity inflation and salary increases. Defined benefit plans Defined benefit plans include pension plans termination indemnities regardless of the reason for the end of employment and other postemployment benefits. As a result of the significant increase in the number of employees in recent years and the high level of acquisition activity pension obligations essentially relate to active employees. The defined benefit pension plans cover beneficiaries including active employees former employees with vested benefits and retirees and surviving dependents. The pension obligations are concentrated in four countries Germany the USA the United Kingdom and Canada which account for more than of total pension obligations. The weighted average term of the defined benefit pension obligations is around years. This term is based on the present value of the obligations. Germany In Germany Continental provides pension benefits through the cash balance plan prior commitments and deferred compensation. The retirement plan regulation applicable to active members is based primarily on the cash balance plan and thus on benefit modules. When the insured event occurs the retirement plan assets are paid out as a lumpsum benefit in installments or as a pension depending on the amount of the retirement plan assets. There are no material minimum guarantees in relation to a particular amount of retirement benefits. Pension plans transferred to or assumed by Continental in the context of acquisitions Siemens VDO Temic Teves Phoenix were included in the cash balance plan. For the main German companies the cash balance plan is partly covered by funds in contractual trust arrangements CTAs. In Germany there are no legal or regulatory minimum funding requirements. The CTAs are legally independent from the company and manage the plan assets as trustees in accordance with the respective CTAs.
