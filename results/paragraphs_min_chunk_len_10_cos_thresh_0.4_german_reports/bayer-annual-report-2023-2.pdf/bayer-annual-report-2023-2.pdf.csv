289,Our mission is to transform the agricultural sector at scale on the basis of regenerative farming and to create a more sustainable food production system. For us regenerative agriculture is an outcomebased production model based on two key building blocks productivity which focuses on helping farms to produce more with less and regeneration which focuses on delivering a positive impact on nature. Our central objectives are to increase agricultural yields and thereby improve the economic and social wellbeing of farmers while at the same time ensuring a positive impact on the environment for example by improving soil health reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing carbon sequestration to halt the advance of climate change protecting and promoting biodiversity and conserving water resources. As part of our commitment to sustainable agriculture we are pursuing ambitious sustainability targets for . We aim to enable our farming customers to reduce their onfield greenhouse gas emissions per mass unit of crop produced by compared to the overall base year emission intensity,0.3822018431573587,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
291, We also aim to reduce the environmental impact of our global crop protection portfolio per hectare by against a average baseline. Furthermore we are working to support million smallholder farmers in low and middleincome countries by improving their access to agricultural products services and partnerships and we are targeting a reduction in water use per kilogram of rice crop by transforming ricecropping systems for our smallholder customers in the relevant regions where we operate starting in India,0.34601941971728933,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At Crop Science we are driving forward the development of innovative products and services tailored to farmers individual needs. We increasingly offer our customers comprehensive and novel systems solutions to drive longterm growth. With our investments in research and development we have developed cuttingedge technologies and innovations which are designed to increase our customers productivity and thus enhance food security and help farmers further reduce the environmental cost of agriculture. Some of these innovations were presented to the public in at the inaugural Crop Science Innovation Summit with the concept of regenerative agriculture taking center stage. We offer a range of products and services to promote this approach to farming such as our shortstature corn the Climate FieldView integrated digital platform and our carbon farming activities which enable farmers to sequester carbon in soil. Our crop protection innovations enable us to set new industry standards with sustainable solutions and develop a new generation of crop protection products through the CropKey approach. The focus here is on new mechanisms of action and selecting the best technological solutions with safety and sustainability aspects being taken into consideration right from the beginning. Our wholly owned subsidiary Targenomix makes an important contribution in this regard by leveraging its leading knowhow in the area of systems biology. In we began the construction of a building complex at the Monheim site in Germany that includes laboratories offices and a greenhouse area. This million investment will go toward helping make crop protection products safer for people animals and the environment. We aim to increase our market potential by tapping into new adjacent markets. To achieve this goal we are increasingly focusing on partnerships. Our collaboration with Kimitec Sociedad Limitada Spain in the area of biologicals is one such example.

545,Sustainability is one of our strategic levers. That means that our business activities are systematically geared toward generating a positive impact for people and the planet. Effective sustainability management throughout the organization is ensured by clearly defined roles and responsibilities. The Chairman of the Board of Management CEO in his capacity as Chief Sustainability Officer CSO and the entire Board of Management hold firstlevel responsibility for this strategy. An external Sustainability Council advises the Board of Management on all matters relating to sustainability and offers a critical constructive perspective. In addition we have a Human Rights Officer who oversees the management of risks relating to human rights and provides updates to the Board of Management. In we established a separate Supervisory Board committee for the areas of environmental protection social affairs and corporate governance ESG Committee. The committee oversees and advises management on integrating sustainability into the business strategy and corporate governance as well as on sustainabilityrelated opportunities and risks including potential consequences for the companys reputation. In addition the Public Affairs Science and Sustainability Health Safety Environment PASS HSE enabling function supports the CSO and Board of Management in identifying risks and opportunities developing strategies and defining sustainability management targets and guidelines. It also provides governance for sustainability topics. Sustainability management is integrated into the existing management and governance structures and the core processes of the entire organization. Our commitment to the UN Global Compact and the Responsible Care initiative of the chemical industry and our involvement in the World Business Council for Sustainable Development WBCSD underline our profile as a company that acts sustainably. ,,0.3149547663932457,,,0.3925031074320497,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

549,We are committed to supporting science society and the common good. Like our business activities our social engagement is guided by our purpose Science for a better life and our mission Health for all Hunger for none. Together with our network of partners and our employees we support social projects around the world in the areas of health nutrition and the environment and engage with communities to create longlasting societal impact. As part of these endeavors we increasingly support social innovation and social enterprises. Responding to disasters by providing humanitarian aid also plays a crucial role in our social commitment. Through our disaster relief programs we support communities affected by natural disasters and public health crises. In we provided around million for social impact programs worldwide. This included products costing around million that we donated to organizations in countries and communities in need. of our cash and product contributions went to low and middleincome countries. In we conducted projects worldwide with partner organizations including the Bayer foundations Bayer Foundation focusing on the global south and life sciences Bayer Fund USA Bayer Foundation India and Hans and Berthold Finkelstein Foundation active in Germany other European countries and Israel which generate an important impact for society in line with our mission and corporate purpose. Our workforce is likewise personally involved in community volunteering. In for example our employees founded the PROSI Pro Social Initiatives program which brings together employees worldwide to engage in social volunteering. Building on the successes of PROSI also saw the introduction of the Groups Corporate Volunteering framework which allows employees to spend at least one workday per year volunteering with social organizations. Germany implemented the concept in October other countries will follow. Employees can use an online platform for volunteering to search for organizations and also propose projects themselves. Existing volunteer programs e.g. in the United States will be continued or combined under the Corporate Volunteering scheme. The contributions we make in the form of monetary product or other inkind donations are governed by our global Corporate Charitable Giving Procedure. It establishes clear criteria for recipient eligibility and project selection and also sets forth the strategy we follow to generate longterm impact for society in line with our sustainability goals. Our charitable contributions are recorded and approved centrally which provides a transparent overview of our contributions to supporting social causes around the world. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.2796559813234295,,

556,Our substances and finished products undergo extensive assessment and testing along the entire value chain. Based on these results we develop measures to minimize health and environmental risks. Our divisions have quality management systems in place that are based on international industryspecific standards. By implementing a binding companywide quality assurance system we aim to guarantee highquality safe and effective products and services that satisfy all internal and external requirements and meet customer expectations. This helps to avoid customer complaints product recalls and other problems. For all chemical substances we compile safety data sheets targeting professional users.

562,Biodiversity Agriculture can benefit significantly from species that provide and maintain important ecosystem services such as pollination and natural pest control and perform soilrelated functions such as nutrient replenishment. At the same time the very purpose of agriculture is to provide a safe and secure food supply for humans which can lead to a loss or reduction of biodiversity for example through landuse change degradation or fragmentation of habitats. To foster production which minimizes the impact on the environment we are investigating and developing cultivation systems that help achieve a better balance between productivity and the conservation of soil health and habitats. In many of our field trials we evaluate how our solutions in combination with practices such as no till cover crops or wider crop rotation help to improve soil health without compromising farmers profitability. In addition we have various cooperation projects involving the Bayer ForwardFarms and nature conservation experts where we research how a better balance could be achieved in various countries and regions. We also support and encourage the development of integrated pest management IPM and pollinator management methods that conserve the abundance and diversity of beneficial insects protect pollinators and reduce the use of pesticides or replace compounds with a less favorable environmental safety profile with modern more environmentally friendly solutions. We therefore conduct comprehensive field trials under agronomic conditions in various crops around the globe with the objective of deriving recommendations regarding the best positioning of our products within an IPM system to protect pollinators and beneficials. We promote the responsible use of natural resources both complying with international and national legislation as well as respecting biodiversity. Our principles on biodiversity are set forth in a corporate policy and a separate position paper on this issue. In this we express our commitment to the objectives of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity which includes the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources. We also have a supplementary corporate policy in place that is designed to ensure compliance with international and national legislation on access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources. Through monetary and nonmonetary contributions to the establishment of new gene banks that serve to preserve the genetic diversity of crops we help to facilitate the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources. In addition we participate in a variety of projects with public partners to enable improved local food crops and promote the buildup of capacities to breed better crops while also supporting other global efforts to preserve biodiversity. Furthermore we continually deploy plant breeding innovations that help improve the genetic diversity of crops food security and ecological sustainability. Biotechnology We apply biotechnological methods in biopharmaceutical production e.g. Kogenate Kovaltry Jivi and the development of innovative biopharmaceuticals and cell and gene therapies. In addition we apply biotechbased methods to seeds e.g. SmartStax PRO with RNAi Technology corn Intacta Xtend soybeans and Bollgard with XtendFlex cotton. In plant breeding we use a variety of methods including conventional breeding approaches and genetic engineering. Genetically modified crops can help increase the sustainability of food production because they enable farmers to produce more food with less impact on natural resources.For us the safety of people and the environment is always the top priority in the use of biotechnology. In addition to meeting legal and regulatory requirements we have specified the responsible use of genetic engineering and strict globally applicable safety measures for handling biological substances in corresponding corporate policies. The development and commercialization of genetically improved seeds are also subject to stringent laws and regulations. In addition we have established internal processes to ensure the responsible use of biotechnologically manufactured products throughout their life cycle. Furthermore our Crop Science Division maintained its membership in the Excellence Through Stewardship organization in . ,0.4140254573779627,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
564,Trace substances in the environment We are committed to preventing emissions of product residues e.g. active ingredients and their degradation products into the environment or where these are unavoidable to minimize the risks they harbor. We focus on all stages of the product cycle from manufacturing to safe use and disposal. At our production sites around the world regulatory authorities and external assessors monitor compliance with wastewater thresholds. Internal experts also perform corresponding audits of the production sites at regular intervals. We take appropriate action in our production facilities to avoid or reduce emissions from production such as the release of active ingredients into the environment. Alongside the regulatory standards such action also comes in the form of our own more farreaching environmental standards for instance as outlined in our corporate policies. We are also working to develop further effective risk minimization measures in various research projects. With regard to the application of crop protection products the potential environmental impact is investigated in ecotoxicological studies during development and prior to the official product approval process. The responsible authorities receive an extensive environmental risk assessment and can specify risk minimization measures as appropriate. Environmental risk assessments are also conducted in Europe and the United States for the official approval of human pharmaceuticals. ,,,,,0.3772091866136058,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

596,Transportation and warehouse safety is part of HSE management and is implemented by networks of supply chain experts. In addition to complying with legal regulations we have implemented supplementary standards and requirements that are defined in corporate policies. This ensures that our materials are handled and transported in accordance with their respective potential hazards and applicable regulations. There were transport incidents in primarily involving road transport accidents. We define transport incidents as accidents that cause personal injury or significant damage to property environmental impact resulting from the release of substances or leakage of hazardous goods. ,,0.30822720724406955,0.3955325644031141,,0.3523043045819103,0.3251758006779768,0.4456239397622078,0.5396517533353372,,,,,0.3515275954097218,,,,,,

601,Our sustainability targets Chapter .. help us to realize our mission of Health for all Hunger for none. In addition we also report on other nonfinancial aspects. For we are required to disclose the proportion of turnover sales capital expenditure CapEx and operating expenditure OpEx in the reporting period that is EU taxonomyeligible and taxonomyaligned with regard to the environmental objectives climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. For the four additional environmental objectives sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources the transition to a circular economy pollution prevention and control and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems by contrast we are only required to disclose taxonomyeligible turnover capital expenditure and operating expenditure. Company activities are assessed for taxonomy eligibility based on the economic activities described in Annexes I and II to the Delegated Act of June and Annexes I through IV to the Delegated Act of June . To avoid doublecounting results are documented for example at product master data level. Taxonomy alignment is evaluated based on the technical screening criteria for each economic activity which are also defined in the aforementioned Annexes. We use our own interpretation when applying the EU taxonomy as definitions are not yet available and the wording used is unclear. The FAQ documents published by the European Commission as of December were duly taken into account. ,0.3273903583860889,0.31175915459913633,0.44656390259407724,,0.40087872757837967,,0.4536528915763255,,,,,,,0.38946767232045354,,,,,
603,The definition of turnover according to EU taxonomy corresponds with the sales reported in the consolidated financial statements see Note . A portion of our core business became taxonomyeligible for the first time through the passage of Delegated Regulation EU of June due to an economic activity manufacture of medicinal products which can contribute to the environmental objective pollution prevention and control. Sales of the Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health divisions can be attributed to this economic activity. The determination of taxonomyeligible sales takes place at product level. According to our interpretation sales generated from medicinal products that are merely resold repackaged or mixed are not taxonomyeligible. Taxonomyeligible sales amounted to million in million and taxonomynoneligible sales amounted to million million. The proportion of taxonomyeligible sales was thus . . Due to the simplified reporting requirements for with respect to the four environmental objectives to be applied for the first time there are no taxonomyaligned sales to disclose. ,,,0.3822895105036096,,0.3519019878531227,,0.5019583165956998,,,,,,,,,,,,

617,The taxonomyeligible capital expenditure is determined by linking the capital expenditure undertaken with the taxonomyeligible products Category a. Capital expenditure that cannot be clearly assigned is taken into consideration on the basis of allocation keys. Capital expenditures for the purchase of products from taxonomyeligible economic activities or individual measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions Category c are also included in this figure. As explained in the previous section no taxonomy alignment review was undertaken in for the economic activity manufacture of medicinal products. Furthermore at present there is no process for reliably verifying the acquisition of taxonomyaligned products in Category c. The procedure for the remaining capital expenditure in connection with the environmental objective climate change mitigation is described below. We examine whether or not an economic activity contributes substantially to climate change mitigation based on the individual asset. To rule out significant harm being caused to other environmental objectives we assess the respective criteria at various levels. The criteria for climate change adaptation are assessed at site level while the in some cases highly granular requirements for the other environmental objectives are examined at the individual asset level. Compliance with the minimum safeguards is examined at Group level taking into account existing corporate policies and risk management processes with respect to human rights compliance anticorruption and other aspects. We incurred taxonomyeligible capital expenditure CapEx of million in million. Taxonomynoneligible capital expenditure amounted to million million. The proportion of taxonomyeligible capital expenditure therefore came to . ..

The improvement in the financial result was largely due to a net positive change in the fair value of financial investments and higher interest income from investments in particular. These effects were partly offset by higher interest expense and negative currency effects related to the Argentinian peso. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.38490842703805156,,,,,

We build on this by analyzing the respective market environments to identify opportunities. These analyses are based on different time periods since trends or developments may impact our business over the short medium or long term. In addition we identify and leverage opportunities as part of our regular business operations and through our daily observation of internal processes and markets.

1003,Report pursuant to Section Paragraph and Section Paragraph of the German Commercial Code As part of the comprehensive risk management system we have an internal control system over financial reporting ICSOFR in place for the Group accounting and financial reporting process. This system comprises suitable structures and workflows that are defined and implemented throughout the organization. The purpose of our ICSOFR is to ensure proper and effective accounting and Group financial reporting in accordance with the relevant reporting principles. The ICSOFR is designed to guarantee timely uniform and accurate accounting for all business transactions based on applicable statutory regulations accounting and financial reporting standards and the internal Group policies that are binding on all consolidated companies. Risks are identified and assessed and appropriate countermeasures are taken to mitigate them. Mandatory Groupwide standards such as systembased and manual reconciliation processes and functional separation have been derived from these frameworks and promulgated throughout the Bayer Group. These standards are implemented by the Bayer Group companies. Compliance with these standards is the responsibility of the respective management teams. However it should be noted that an internal control system irrespective of its design cannot provide absolute assurance that material misstatements in the financial reporting will be avoided or identified. ,,,,,,,,,,0.3379950656778169,,,,,,,,,
1010,All levels of the company are included in risk management in order to heighten the awareness and understanding of risks. This lays the foundation for a risk culture with independent proactive and systematic risk management involving clearly defined roles and responsibilities principles standards methods tools and training measures. The aims of the risk management system are to achieve risk transparency which also encompasses the early detection of risks to support riskbased treatment decisions and to ensure compliance with legal requirements. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.344024000076377,,,,0.2748402962502865,,

1040,Our business activity is subject to extensive regulations that continue to develop and may become more stringent including in certain cases for reasons of a political nature. For example further restrictions could be imposed on the sale and use of various crop protection products. In addition approvals that have already been granted are currently being challenged and will likely continue to be challenged in court especially by NGOs potentially resulting in temporary or permanent revocation of product registrations or approvals and financial loss from reduced sales of crop protection products as well as associated seed offerings. Conserving biodiversity is one of the topics at hand in this respect together with potential restrictions on the manufacture and use of certain chemical substances. Approval conditions may also become even more challenging for the Pharmaceuticals Division. In addition the pricing of pharmaceutical products could become more strictly regulated not only for products already exposed to generic competition but also for innovative patentprotected products. Residues of agrochemical products pharmaceutical compounds or microplastics in the environment could also become subject to more stringent regulation. In addition regulatory changes could affect agricultural imports from other parts of the world and therefore our business in those regions. We also need to prepare for regulatory changes in the field of AI in the future. Regulatory changes could also cause uncertainty over our products patent protection potentially resulting in financial losses that may even include the repayment of license fees. Regulatory changes may also lead to higher product development costs and longer development times or even necessitate adjustments to our product portfolio which in turn may negatively impact our reputation. We counter such risks by monitoring changes in regulatory requirements in order to adequately address them within the company. We pursue a global strategy that bundles our strong product portfolio and sustainability commitments and leverages our global business presence. We also deploy inhouse RD capacities make acquisitions and enter into collaborations while aligning our product portfolio to reflect anticipated changes. We also address these risks by engaging in dialogue with the authorities with the goal of promoting sciencebased decisionmaking and by appropriately participating to defend against challenges to product approvals. ,0.3188722428501402,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1050,Skilled and dedicated employees are essential for our companys success. Difficulties in recruiting hiring and retaining urgently needed specialized employees on a regional level also in view of competition between employers and in employee development could have significant adverse consequences for our companys future development. Developments such as the growing relevance of disruptive technologies and the new operating model we intend to adopt together with new ways of working will require new innovative skillsets from our employees. Based on our analysis of future requirements we counter these risks by designing appropriate employee recruitment and development measures. In addition we align our corporate culture toward diversity and employee needs based on data analyses and insights enabling us to tap the full potential of the employment market. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.394245231211874,,,,,,

1052,Our business and production processes and our internal and external communications are dependent on global IT systems. Ensuring the optimal alignment of our IT architecture which also encompasses the use of cloudbased services and management of any service providers commissioned therefore represents a challenge. This means that system reliability and the confidentiality of internal and external data are of fundamental importance to us. If our governance fails to adequately address this challenging environment our operational stability could negatively impact our business and our information security requirements may not be met adequately. If the risk of a breach of data confidentiality integrity or authenticity for example due to cyber attacks were to materialize it could lead to the manipulation andor uncontrolled outflow of data and knowledge and to reputational damage. Such attacks may also be carried out by inhouse personnel. Our business andor production processes could also be temporarily disrupted by cyber attacks. To counter these risks we evaluate and utilize new technologies. Projects and measures have also been implemented to keep technical security precautions up to date and proactively identify and examine new threats. In addition security measures implemented by the Corporate Cyber Defense Center protect our IT infrastructure against unauthorized access. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.33730171106128176,,,,,,

1078,In almost every country in which we operate our business activity is subject to extensive regulations standards requirements and inspections that also apply to our local contract manufacturers. In the area of health this largely pertains to clinical studies and manufacturing processes but also to production materials for example. At our Crop Science Division extensive requirements apply along the value chain such as in our production activities and also with respect to the external partners involved. Acquisitions may at times also be subject to requirements compliance with which must be ensured both during and after the integration process. Potential infringements of regulatory requirements may result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines restrictions on our freedom to operate andor other adverse financial consequences. They could also harm our reputation and lead to declining sales andor margins. We counter these risks through binding principles standards and the control mechanisms in place. Quality requirements are defined and implemented in global quality management systems. ,,,0.4380898538831873,,,,0.4132764485475887,,,0.31326338961471634,,,0.33966642330775954,,,,,,
1080,Potential criminal activities targeting our employees property or business activities represent a risk for our company. These include intellectual property theft vandalism physical attacks and sabotage. In addition counterfeit versions of our products could be put into circulation. There is also the risk of crisis situations such as a pandemic or a prolonged power outage that could lead to a breakdown of our critical IT infrastructure and our production. We counter these risks which in addition to financial effects could also negatively affect our reputation in some cases if they were to materialize through our local crisis organizations which produce response plans and take further measures.

1097, women at the second management level. These targets are to be attained by June . As part of the succession planning process the Board of Management informs the Supervisory Board about candidates who have been identified as having the potential to become a member of the Board of Management. Among other things the Supervisory Board places emphasis on intensive human resources development at the management level below the Board of Management while taking into account the diversity criteria outlined above. The Supervisory Board endeavors to meet the respective candidates personally during presentations given to the Supervisory Board or its committees or on other occasions. The company has identified candidates who would be able to step in to replace individual Board of Management members and assume their roles at short notice if required. Whenever it becomes clear that there will be an empty seat on the Board of Management efforts are undertaken to identify and evaluate prospective candidates inside and outside the company. When necessary an HR consulting firm is brought in to aid the process. ,,0.2935612457982298,,,,,,,,,,,0.37463276627101016,,,0.3288483519498181,0.26700709834208375,,
1105,Supervisory Board as a whole unless otherwise determined. However since the Supervisory Board can only nominate candidates for election as stockholder representatives it can only take the objectives into account in these nominations. One objective for Supervisory Board elections is that neither women nor men account for less than of the membership in line with the legal requirements. Implementation status of the objectives The Supervisory Board has several members with international business experience or an international background. The ages of the members of the Supervisory Board ranged from to years as of December . One member of the Supervisory Board Dr. Paul Achleitner has been a member of the Supervisory Board for more than years. As such the Supervisory Board does not consider him to be independent as defined in Section C. of the German Corporate Governance Code. However the Supervisory Board does not harbor any concerns about Dr. Achleitners impartiality or any potential conflicts of interest. The Supervisory Board considers the stockholder representatives Dr. Simone BagelTrah Horst Baier Dr. Norbert Bischofberger Ertharin Cousin Colleen A. Goggins Kimberly Mathisen Alberto Weisser Prof. Dr. Otmar Wiestler and Prof. Dr. Norbert Winkeljohann to be independent. The proportion of women on the Supervisory Board is currently for the full Supervisory Board for the employee representatives and for the stockholder representatives. Seven of the members of the Supervisory Board are citizens of a country other than Germany. Numerous other members have many years of international business experience. The members of the Supervisory Board have also completed a whole range of vocational training and study courses. For the purposes of the qualification matrices below the Supervisory Board primarily considers its members to possess expertise and experience in the corresponding areas if they have completed professional training in that field or have amassed many years of professional experience including several years as a member of the Supervisory Board or one of its respective committees. In the opinion of the Supervisory Board the stockholder representatives have the following special expertise and experience as well as the following independence status ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.2781179595653932,,,

1114,Procedure and committees The role of the Supervisory Board is to oversee and advise the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board is directly involved in decisions on matters of fundamental importance to the company regularly conferring with the Board of Management on the companys strategic alignment and the implementation status of the business strategy. The Report of the Supervisory Board in this Annual Report provides details about the work of the Supervisory Board and its committees. In addition to the Presidial Committee and the Nomination Committee the Supervisory Board also has an Innovation Committee and an ESG Committee to oversee and advise the Board of Management on matters relating to innovation and sustainability respectively. Furthermore the Human Resources and Compensation Committee deals intensively with succession planning and the compensation of the Board of Management. The Audit Committee discusses the audit risk assessment the audit strategy and audit planning as well as the audit results with the auditor. As part of this process the Chairman of the Audit Committee regularly discusses the progress of the audit with the independent auditor including during conversations held outside the meetings of the Audit Committee and reports to the Committee. The Audit Committee consults with the independent auditor on a regular basis both with and without the Board of Management present.The Supervisory Board has set itself rules of procedure that are published on the companys website. These rules govern various aspects such as how conflicts of interest are handled. In line with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code the rules of procedure state that conflicts of interest must be disclosed to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and that material conflicts of interest that are not merely temporary in nature shall result in the termination of that persons appointment to the Supervisory Board. When new members join the Supervisory Board a series of introductory meetings are arranged with the members of the Board of Management and with representatives from specialist functions to introduce them to their work on the Supervisory Board and informational material is also provided in written form. Training events are held for the members of the Supervisory Board at regular intervals. In they focused largely on digitalization issues. In the Supervisory Board conducted a selfassessment to evaluate how effectively it performs its duties. An external consultant was brought in to aid the process. ,,0.3183412115045863,,,0.3565965416360405,,,,,0.29643408307393077,,,,,,,,,

1134,Business lease agreements exist between Bayer AG on the one hand and Bayer CropScience AG and Bayer Pharma AG the former parent companies of the divisions Crop Science and Pharmaceuticals on the other. Bayer AG as lessee manages these two companies operational businesses on the basis of these agreements. In addition to its holding company function Bayer AG thus also performs the parent company functions with respect to the two divisions. Bayer AG is a generator and supplier of utilities at multiple locations and thus an energy utility as defined in Section No. of the German Energy Industry Act EnWG. Since utility supply networks are operated by a subsidiary Bayer AG also constitutes a vertically integrated energy utility under Section No. of the EnWG. However regarding its own activities it is only subject to the separate accounting obligation and not the obligation to prepare activity reports. The financial statements of Bayer AG are prepared in accordance with the German Commercial Code HGB and the German Stock Corporation Act AktG. Because the company is an integrated energy utility the provisions of Section b of the EnWG are also observed. ,,,,0.41672799440699815,,,,,,0.3006560749382039,,,,,,,,,

1147,Current and miscellaneous assets fell to million million. Inventories increased to million million. Accounts receivable from subsidiaries which mainly comprised loan receivables and receivables under profit and loss transfer agreements fell to million million. The increase in other assets to million million largely resulted from higher tax receivables. Holdings of marketable securities declined to million million due to the sale of euro and US dollar investments with indefinite maturities. Equity rose by million to million million. Provisions fell to million million. The provisions recognized for the excess of pension liabilities over plan assets declined to million million. This change was partly attributable to an increase in fund assets due to the favorable development of the fair value of the assets held by BPT and lower obligations from pension entitlements due to modified pension trend assumptions. Provisions for taxes fell to million million primarily due to the change in provisions for income taxes not yet finally assessed. Miscellaneous provisions fell to million million with personnelrelated provisions decreasing to million million. This was mainly attributable to a decline in provisions for variable compensation components to million million and a decrease in provisions for personnelrelated restructuring measures to million million. Other miscellaneous provisions fell to million million mainly due to a decline in provisions for the assumption of costs for restructuring measures to million million and a decrease in provisions for impending losses to million million. Liabilities and deferred income net of deductible receivables fell to million million. Five new bonds with a total volume of million were issued in . In addition two existing hybrid bonds issued in and were partially repurchased volume of million. As such the total volume of outstanding bonds increased to million million. Liabilities to banks declined from million to million million mainly due to the repayment of loans. The decline in trade accounts payable to million million mainly pertained to trade accounts payable to subsidiaries. Payables to subsidiaries fell to million million largely due to a decline in loans to million million. Miscellaneous liabilities rose to million million mainly because of additions to commercial paper. Financial obligations declined to million million. IntraGroup financial obligations decreased by million to million with shortterm loans accounting for million of this figure the increase in liabilities from call deposits for million and higher loan liabilities for million. Liabilities to third parties rose by million to million with the million increase in liabilities for bonds to million partially offset by the million decline in loans from banks to million as the primary factor. In addition there was a million increase in commercial paper. Net debt increased to million million after deduction of million million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. Since all of the own shares acquired in were subsequently resold the transactions were not reflected in equity at the closing date.

1206,The financial statements of the individual companies consolidated are prepared according to uniform recognition and measurement methods. The consolidated financial statements are based on the principle of the historical cost of acquisition construction or production with the exception of the items reflected at fair value such as equity instruments held debt instruments held that do not solely comprise principal and interest payments and derivatives and liabilities that must be recognized or were designated at fair value through profit or loss. In preparing the consolidated financial statements management must make certain assumptions and estimates that may substantially impact the presentation of the Groups financial position andor results of operations. Such estimates assumptions or the exercise of discretion mainly relate to the useful life of noncurrent assets the discounted cash flows used for impairment testing and purchase price allocations and the recognition of provisions including those for litigationrelated expenses pensions and other benefits taxes environmental compliance and remediation costs product liability and guarantees as well as the recognition of refund liabilities. Essential estimates and assumptions that may affect reporting in the various item categories of the financial statements are described in the following sections of this Note. Estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that are considered reasonable under given circumstances. They are continually reviewed but may vary from the actual values. New or revised financial reporting standards often contain options regarding the firsttime application of new recognition and measurement methods. The income statement for the previous year and the opening statement of financial position for that year may be adjusted depending on the option Bayer exercises. For further information on the standards applied for the first time as of January see Note . ,,,,,,,0.40961911299264336,,,,,,,,,,,,

1222,All revenues derived from the selling of products rendering of services or from licensing agreements are recognized as sales. Revenues are based on customer contracts and the performance obligations contained therein which are individually identified and may be presented separately for the purpose of revenue recognition. Revenues are recognized in profit or loss when or as soon as the entity transfers control of goods or services to a customer either over time or at a point in time. Control lies with the customer if the customer can independently determine the use of and consume the benefit derived from a product or service. Revenues from product deliveries are recognized at a point in time based on an overall assessment of the existence of a right to payment the allocation of ownership rights the transfer of physical possession the transfer of risks and rewards and acceptance by the customer. In the case of product deliveries undertaken by the Bayer Group the transfer of risks and rewards and the right to determine the product shipment destination are particularly important. Depending on the transfer of control revenues from services are recognized either at a point in time or over the period of time when services are rendered and in accordance with a reasonable measure of progress. Net sales are limited to the amount the Bayer Group expects to receive for the fulfillment of performance obligations. Payment components to be withheld for third parties are deducted. Sales are therefore reduced by sales taxes and by actual and expected sales deductions resulting from rebates discounts and bonuses. Furthermore sales are reduced by the amount of the refund liability for expected returns of defective goods or of saleable products that may be returned under contractual arrangements with this reduction taking place at the date of revenue recognition or when a reliable estimate can be made. Refund liabilities are recognized for expected sales deductions and product returns. Sales deductions and refund liabilities are estimated primarily on the basis of historical experience specific contractual terms price information and thus future expectations of sales development. The underlying assumptions applied for refund liabilities are reviewed at each closing date and revised where necessary. ,,,,,,,0.5104438041061621,,0.33992773496591006,,,,,,,,,,
1223,Assets from expected product returns are recognized in inventories as rightofreturn assets at the previous carrying amounts less any recovery and processing costs and potential impairments. For unilaterally fulfilled customer contracts where more than one year passes between performance and payment significant financing components are accounted for separately based on their present values and the subsequent unwinding of the discount. The underlying discount rate takes into account the individual credit risk of the contracting party that receives the financing. Revenues from contracts involving noncash consideration such as exchange transactions are measured at the fair value of the assets received or the right to receive them. Some of the Bayer Groups revenues are generated on the basis of licensing agreements under which third parties have been granted the right to use or access products and technologies. A righttouse license is characterized by the underlying technology remaining essentially unchanged over the period for which the rights are granted. With a righttoaccess license by contrast the customers interest is directed toward the consistent further development of that intellectual property. Revenues from righttouse licenses are recognized at a specific point in time while those from righttoaccess licenses are recognized over time according to the underlying measure of progress. Milestone payments related to righttoaccess licenses are allocated to satisfied and unsatisfied portions of the underlying performance obligation as applicable. Consideration relating to already satisfied obligations is recognized as catchup adjustments to revenue. Payment elements still to be earned are deferred as contract liabilities. Sales or usagebased royalties agreed in connection with outlicensing arrangements are only recognized if the sale or the usage is sufficiently verified and the underlying performance obligation has been fulfilled. In the Crop Science segment Bayer conducts barter transactions in certain geographies to grant its customers longer payment terms while at the same time reducing the credit risk. For example payment may be made in the form of a subsequent delivery of soybeans or corn or crops may be pledged as collateral. Any commodityprice risk that Bayer is exposed to as a result is hedged using derivatives. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in other operating income and expenses. If Bayer assumes control of goods such as soybeans instead of receiving a cash payment their resale is accounted for in other operating income and their derecognition in other operating expenses since transactions of this nature do not form part of normal business operations. ,0.32836218153684266,,,,,,0.4468822025641064,,,0.31277855942595334,,0.3048472491087614,,,,,,,
1225,Research expenses are recognized through profit or loss. Development expenses are only capitalized as internally generated intangible assets if the recognition criteria of IAS Intangible Assets are met. These include sufficient certainty that the development activity will give rise to future financial cash flows that also cover the respective development expenses. Since our own development projects are often subject to regulatory approval procedures and other uncertainties the conditions for the capitalization of costs incurred before receipt of approvals generally are not satisfied. Development costs for internal software projects can be capitalized. Costs in connection with the implementation of cloud applications are usually recognized through profit or loss. If the definitions and recognition criteria of IAS are met which can be the case with interfaces for example the costs are capitalized as an intangible asset. Capitalized development expenses are recognized at the cost of generation and amortized over their expected useful lives. Impairment testing is also performed on an annual or eventdriven basis. ,,,,,,0.38544719290047896,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1227,Income taxes comprise the taxes levied on taxable income in the individual countries along with changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are recognized in profit or loss. This also includes current income taxes resulting from tax laws that have come into force or been adopted to implement the Pillar Two Model Rules published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD. The income taxes recognized are reflected at the amounts likely to be payable under the statutory regulations in force or already enacted in relation to future periods at the end of the reporting period. Complex tax regulations may give rise to uncertainties with respect to their interpretation and the amounts and timing of future taxable income. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the longterm nature and ,,,,,,,0.4247325700061059,,,0.3173122582341995,,,,,0.31720977296848096,0.2869573741210619,,,
1228,complexity of existing contractual agreements differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made or future changes to such assumptions could necessitate adjustments to tax income and expense in future periods. Liabilities to tax authorities that are uncertain as to their amount and the probability of their occurrence are recognized as tax liabilities based on reasonable estimates. The amounts recognized are based on various factors such as experience with previous tax audits and differing legal interpretations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority. In compliance with IAS Income Taxes deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position prepared according to IFRS and their tax bases. Deferred taxes are also recognized for loss carryforwards interest carryforwards and tax credits that are likely to be usable. Based on the exception stated in IAS .A deferred taxes related to Pillar Two are not recognized nor is information thereon disclosed. Deferred tax assets relating to deductible temporary differences tax credits loss carryforwards and interest carryforwards are recognized where it is probable that taxable income or sufficiently taxable temporary differences will be available in the future to enable them to be used. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized on temporary differences taxable in the future. Deferred taxes are calculated at the rates which on the basis of the statutory regulations in force or already enacted in relation to future periods as of the closing date are expected to apply in the individual countries at the time of realization. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if Bayer has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and these are levied by the same taxation authority. Material effects of changes in tax rates or tax law on deferred tax assets and liabilities are generally accounted for in the period in which the changes are enacted. Such effects are recognized in profit or loss except where they relate to deferred taxes that were recognized outside profit or loss in which case they are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Deferred and current taxes are recognized in profit or loss unless they relate to items recognized outside profit or loss in other comprehensive income in which case they too are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. The probability that deferred tax assets resulting from temporary differences loss carryforwards or interest carryforwards can be used in the future is the subject of forecasts by the individual consolidated companies regarding their future earnings situation and other parameters. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized on planned dividend payments by subsidiaries. Where no dividend payment is planned for the foreseeable future no deferred tax liability is recognized on the difference between the proportionate net assets according to IFRS and the tax base of the investment in the subsidiary. ,,,,,,,0.41335838897700045,,,0.3183344449404452,,,,,,,,,

1235,The expected useful lives of such assets and the amortization patterns are determined based on estimates of the period for which they will generate cash flows. In addition a review is conducted as of each closing date to ascertain whether there are any indications of impairment and impairment testing may then potentially be performed. Should inlicensing result in consideration for the acquisition of intellectual property this is capitalized as an intangible asset. If the transaction also includes research and development activities the share of consideration attributable to these activities is deferred and recognized through profit and loss according to the utilization thereof. If separately capitalizable intangible assets are acquired within the scope of software projects such as SHANA implementation the related costs are correspondingly capitalized. Emission allowances meet the criteria of intangible assets and are not subject to amortization due to their indefinite useful life. If emission allowances are granted to the company free of charge by a statutory authority in connection with regulatory requirements like the EU Emissions Trading System EU ETS no amount is recognized for emission allowances. If more emissions are emitted than the allocated emission allowances permit additional allowances are purchased and recognized as intangible assets at cost. Corresponding provisions are recognized in the period in which the emissions are emitted and usually reflect the cost of acquisition of the emission certificates. If the emissions in a specific period exceed the corresponding emission allowances this portion of the provision is measured at the current market value of the allowances. When the allowances are retired the intangible assets are derecognized and the corresponding provisions are reversed.

If they are used in the production process or are intended for sale within the normal course of business they are recognized in inventories. If the certificates are retired immediately upon acquisition for the purpose of offsetting they are recognized directly in functional costs. ,,,0.34218926760330426,0.39269576375527937,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1241,A review is conducted as of each closing date to ascertain whether there are any indications of impairment. When assets are sold closed down or scrapped the difference between the net proceeds and the net carrying amount of the assets is recognized as a gain or loss in other operating income or expenses respectively. Grants and subsidies from third parties that serve to promote investment are reflected in the statement of financial position under other liabilities and amortized to income over the useful lives of the respective investments in property plant or equipment or in line with the terms of the grant or subsidy. Investment property comprises land and buildings not being used for operational or administrative purposes. It is measured using the cost model. The fair value of this property reported in the Notes is primarily determined on the basis of internal valuations using the income approach while that of undeveloped sites is mainly calculated using the market comparison approach. ,0.3773380589059111,0.30845121657964913,,0.34251384763479986,0.4178054477085785,0.42287567441453217,,,,,,0.4320907993184753,,,,,,0.2549796759256635,
1246,A lease is established by a contract that conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. As lessee Bayer generally recognizes the present value of the future lease payments as a financial liability. The lease payments are split into principal and interest portions according to the effectiveinterest method. In line with this and taking into account any further cost components the rightofuse asset the asset that reflects the right to use the underlying asset is capitalized under property plant and equipment at the inception of the lease. The rightofuse asset is recognized at amortized cost and depreciated by the straightline method. Use is made of the recognition exemptions for certain leases in which the underlying assets are of low value and also for shortterm leases. The lease payments under these contracts are recognized as other operating expenses on a straightline basis over the lease term. Bayer exercises the accounting policy option under IFRS Leases available for lessees not to apply this standard to leases of intangible assets. For certain contracts with both lease and nonlease components Bayer as lessee applies the practical expedient not to separate these components but to recognize them collectively as a single lease component. Payments under intraGroup leases are generally presented as expenses or income in segment reporting in line with the internal reporting system. Lease contracts in which Bayer acts as the lessor and substantially all the risks and rewards of utilizing the underlying asset are transferred to the lessee are classified as finance leases. The net investment in the lease is recognized as a receivable. In the case of operating leases where Bayer is the lessor the leased assets continue to be capitalized and the lease payments are recognized in income on a straightline basis over the lease term. ,,,,,,,,,,,,0.38008677007086666,,,,,,,

1256,Other provisions are recognized for present legal and constructive obligations arising from past events that will probably give rise to a future outflow of resources provided that a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligations. They are established at the present value of the expected future cash outflows and recognized in the respective operating expense items. The interest cost is reflected in the financial result under other financial income and expenses. If the projected obligation declines as a result of a change in the estimate the provision is reversed by the corresponding amount and the resulting income recognized in the operating expense items in which the original charge was recognized. ,,,,0.3170865923717799,,,,0.35662578897608743,0.37706602742347894,0.3126759625836782,0.4785959879529278,0.31148850343488627,,0.38052154390812454,0.35719697081138724,,,,
1257,Costs arising from obligations to decommission or dismantle property plant and equipment are included as a component of the acquisition or construction costs for property plant or equipment if they can be reliably estimated and are covered by provisions. If changes in the estimates require the provisions to be adjusted the carrying amounts of the respective assets are reduced or increased accordingly. Estimating the future costs for environmental protection and similar measures involves in particular uncertainties with regard to the applicable laws and regulations and the actual local conditions. Significant factors in estimating the costs include previous experiences in similar cases expert opinions current costs and new developments affecting costs managements interpretation of current environmental regulations the financial position of third parties that may become obligated to participate in any remediation costs on the basis of joint liability and the remediation methods likely to be deployed. Changes in these assumptions could impact future reported results of the Group. Taking into consideration the experience gained to date and the knowledge and circumstances as of the closing date provisions are believed to be adequate. However material additional costs could be incurred beyond the amounts accrued that result in additional expenses in subsequent periods. Provisions for employee termination benefits are established where the amounts of severance payments additional pension plan modules to be granted or other benefits can be reliably estimated. However material additional costs could be incurred beyond the amounts accrued that result in additional expenses in subsequent periods. Obligations arising from stockbased programs that involve cash settlement pursuant to IFRS Sharebased Payment are covered by provisions in the amount of the fair value of the obligations existing as of the closing date. All resulting changes in value are recognized in profit or loss. Provisions for litigations are established under certain conditions in the case of legal risks. Litigations and other judicial proceedings often raise complex issues and are subject to many uncertainties and complexities including but not limited to the facts and circumstances of each particular case the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought and differences in applicable law. The outcome of any current or future proceedings cannot normally be predicted. It is particularly difficult to assess the likely outcomes of class actions for damages or mass compensation claims in the United States which may give rise to significant financial risks for the Bayer Group. As a result of a final judgment in court proceedings regulatory decisions or the conclusion of a settlement the Bayer Group may incur charges for which no accounting measures have yet been taken for lack of reasonable estimability or which exceed presently established provisions and the insurance coverage. The Bayer Group considers the need for accounting measures in respect of pending or future litigations and the extent of any such measures on the basis of the information available to its legal department and in close consultation with legal counsel acting for the Bayer Group. Where it is more likely than not that such a litigation will result in an outflow of resources that is already reasonably estimable a provision for litigation is recorded in the amount of the present value of the expected cash outflows. Such provisions cover the estimated payments to the plaintiffs court and procedural costs attorney costs and the cost of potential settlements. It is sometimes impossible to reliably determine the existence of a present obligation or reasonably estimate the probability that a potential outflow of resources will result from a pending or future litigation. The status of the material legal risks is described in Note . Due to the special nature of these litigations provisions generally are not established until initial settlements allow an estimate of potential amounts or judgments have been issued. Provisions for legal defense costs are established if it is probable that material costs will have to be incurred for external legal counsel to defend the companys legal position. ,,0.32519016007057405,0.37262244299021,0.3520809827487293,0.4926043406942673,0.39313076614019143,,,,,,0.32105210107301946,,,,,,,

1263,Derivatives are recognized at fair value through profit or loss unless they qualify for hedge accounting. This mainly applies to the exchange hedging of accounting risks the effects of which are reflected in other financial income and expenses as exchange gains or losses. The effective portion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is initially recognized outside profit or loss in other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portions are recognized directly in profit or loss. Only when the hedged item is recognized through profit or loss is the effective portion of the hedging instrument also recognized in the income statement. In the case of commodity futures and options that hedge purchase prices reclassification is to the cost of goods sold. For commodity futures that hedge selling prices reclassification is to sales. The effects of interestrate hedges are reflected in interest income or expense. The effects of the hedging of forecasted sales transactions in foreign currencies are recognized in other operating income or expenses at the time of revenue recognition. The hedging of stockbased employee compensation is recognized in the respective operating expense items of Enabling Functions and Consolidation over the duration of the Aspire programs. Changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized in income along with the adjustments in the carrying amounts of the hedged items. The effects of interestrate hedges are reflected in interest income or expense. ,,,,,,,0.41797705508470556,,,,,,,,,,,,
1268,Divestments of shares in subsidiaries that result in a loss of control are generally accounted for in profit or loss. When shares in a subsidiary are gradually divested in several tranches a reduction in the majority shareholding without the loss of control is reflected outside profit or loss and results in an increase in the equity attributable to noncontrolling interest. After the loss of control the interest remaining at the time of the loss of control is recognized at fair value. ,,,,,,,,,,0.30095170396005033,,0.30350006280831954,,,,,,,
1273,offset all of the remaining greenhouse gas emissions from our own operational processes by purchasing certificates from verified climate protection projects primarily in forestry and agriculture. With respect to our value chain our target is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the relevant Scope categories by at least . in absolute terms by compared with the baseline. In line with the Science Based Target initiative SBTi the Scope categories in the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain Scope Accounting Reporting Standard that are relevant for Bayer are as follows . purchased goods and services . capital goods . fuel and energyrelated activities . upstream transportation and distribution and . business travel. Total Scope and emissions cover all categories defined in the GHG Protocol. An important lever for achieving our climate targets is the purchase of electricity from renewable sources. By we aim to ensure of the electricity we procure is from renewable energy sources. We therefore conclude direct supply agreements for electricity from renewable energy sources or purchase corresponding renewable energy credits. In May we announced the signing of a longterm structured renewable energy credit REC purchase agreement in the United States under which up to . TWh of renewable energy will be generated annually and accordingly up to . million RECs can be acquired by us annually. The agreement will secure of Bayers global and of Bayers USpurchased electricity demand out of renewable sources. The contract is designed as a contract of difference between fixed strike prices and energy prices. Full capacity is currently expected to be reached during . The agreement has an expected initial term of years during which RECs can be purchased. As operations of the facilities have not yet started no RECs were purchased in . The first RECs are expected to be generated purchased and retired in for further informationsee Note . In addition we actively participate in the voluntary carbon market where we both purchase carbon offsets from verified climate protection projects as well as provide our own carbon offsets. In we offset . million metric tons of CO,,,,0.32705653827727094,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1274, equivalents via external projects to achieve climate neutrality at our sites. Besides the voluntary carbon market we also participate in mandatory emissions trading. For further information on how carbon credits and offsets are accounted for see Note . The Crop Science Divisions mediumterm planning contains climaterelated investments in connection with the implementation of the greenhouse gas reduction program that are also taken into account in impairment testing. Since the risks and opportunities from the impact of climate change are balanced there is currently no need to revise the longterm growth rate. Based on currently available information there are no indications that additional impairment losses will be required over and above the impairment losses already recognized see Note . We continuously monitor the risks resulting from climaterelated matters and develop innovative and sustainable methods to minimize them. Based on present information and assumptions we do not currently see any fundamentally changed expectations with regard to the Groups financial position and results of operations. ,0.3568142132168705,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition further reductions in expectations with regard to volumes also had an impact. The impairment losses on goodwill were recognized in other operating expenses. The impairment losses and impairment loss reversals on the assets of the cashgenerating units were allocated to the cost of goods sold selling expenses and research and development expenses. The impairment losses and impairment loss reversals reflected the difference between the respective carrying amounts and their fair value less costs of disposal. Impairment testing was conducted in the third quarter of due to interestrate developments at that time and their related impact on the weighted average cost of capital.

1667,Due to the short maturities of most trade accounts receivable and payable other financial receivables and liabilities and cash and cash equivalents their carrying amounts at the closing date do not significantly differ from the fair values. Trade accounts receivable are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if they can potentially be transferred as part of factoring agreements. In case of a transfer all of the risks and opportunities contained in these agreements are transferred resulting in complete derecognition of the receivables. The fair values of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortized cost that are given for information are the present values of the respective future cash flows. The present values are determined by discounting the cash flows at a closingdate interest rate taking into account the term of the assets or liabilities and also the creditworthiness of the counterparty in certain cases. Where a market price is available however this is deemed to be the fair value. The fair values of financial assets measured at fair value correspond to quoted prices in active markets Level or are determined using valuation techniques based on observable market data as of the end of the reporting period Level or are the present values of the respective future cash flows determined on the basis of unobservable inputs Level . The fair values of derivatives for which no publicly quoted prices exist in active markets Level are determined using valuation techniques based on observable market data as of the end of the reporting period Level . In applying valuation techniques credit or debt value adjustments are determined to account for the credit risk of the contractual party or Bayer. Currency and commodity forward contracts are measured individually at their forward rates or forward prices on the closing date. These depend on spot rates or prices including time spreads. The fair values of interestrate hedging instruments and crosscurrency interestrate swaps were determined by discounting future cash flows over the remaining terms of the instruments at market rates of interest taking into account any foreign currency translation as of the closing date in certain cases. Fair values measured using unobservable inputs are categorized within Level of the fair value hierarchy. This essentially applies to certain debt or equity instruments in some cases to the fair values of embedded derivatives and to obligations for contingent consideration in business combinations. Credit risk is frequently the principal unobservable input used to determine the fair values of debt instruments classified as FVTPL at fair value through profit or loss by the discounted cash flow method. Here the credit spreads of comparable issuers are applied. A significant increase in credit risk could result in a lower fair value whereas a significant decrease could result in a higher fair value. However a relative change of in the credit spread does not materially affect the fair value. When determining the fair values of contingent consideration within the FVTPL nonderivative at fair value through profit or loss category the principal unobservable input is the estimation of the probability that for example predefined milestones for research and development projects will be achieved or that sales targets will be attained as well as the timing of the payments. Changes in these estimates may lead to significant increases or decreases in fair value. Embedded derivatives are separated from their respective host contracts if the contracts do not represent financial assets and are not closely related to them. Such host contracts are generally sale or purchase agreements relating to the operational business. The embedded derivatives cause the cash flows from the contracts to vary with exchangerate or price fluctuations for example. The internal measurement of embedded derivatives is performed using appropriate valuation models such as discounted cash flow models which are based on unobservable inputs. The relevant models include planned sales and purchase volumes and prices derived from market data. Regular monitoring is carried out based on these fair values as part of quarterly reporting. ,,,,,,,0.44012011470312434,0.3560374796680399,,,,,,,,,,,

This matrix serves to specifically incentivize profitable growth in each division. Growth should only be generated while maintaining profitability and raising profitability in the short term should not be incentivized at the expense of growth. At the end of each year the EBITDA margin before special items and the currency and portfolioadjusted sales growth actually achieved by the individual divisions are compared to the target matrix previously set for that year. Failure to meet one of the two minimum values results in a target attainment level of for the divisional component. ,,,,,,,0.42710571757946975,,,,,,,0.38786028551640456,,,,,
