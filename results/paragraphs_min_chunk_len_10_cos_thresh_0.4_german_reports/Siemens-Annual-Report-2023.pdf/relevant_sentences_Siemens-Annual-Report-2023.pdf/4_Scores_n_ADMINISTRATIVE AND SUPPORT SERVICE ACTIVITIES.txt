Industrial Business recorded cash inflows from operating activities that exceeded its profit with the highest contribution from Digital Industries. Cash outflows from changes in operating net working capital were due mainly to Siemens Healthineers which recorded a significant buildup of trade and other receivables as well as inventories due in part to the expected growth of business activities in coming quarters. Cash outflows for purchase of investments and financial assets for investment purposes included additions of assets eligible as central bank collateral and payments for debt or equity investments.Cash outflows from change in receivables from financing activities of SFS related primarily to SFSs debt business.Cash inflows from other disposals of assets included mainly proceeds from disposals of assets eligible as central bank collateral from the sale of the Commercial Vehicles business by Portfolio Companies and from the sale or disposal of debt or equity investments. Cash outflows from the reissuance of treasury shares and other transactions with owners were driven by the purchase of Siemens Healthineers AG treasury shares.

For internal and segment reporting purposes intercompany lease transactions however are classified as operating leases by the lessor and are accounted for offbalance sheet by the lessee except for intercompany leases with Siemens Healthineers as lessees. Intersegment transactions are based on market prices.RevenueRevenue includes revenue from contracts with customers and revenue from leasing activities.

Revenues of Mobility are mainly derived from constructiontype business. ProfitSiemens Managing Board is responsible for assessing the performance of the segments chief operating decision maker. The Companys profitability measure of the segments except for SFS is earnings before interest certain pension costs income taxes and amortization expenses of intangible assets acquired in business combinations as determined by the chief operating decision maker Profit. The major categories of items excluded from Profit are described below.Interest income expenses are excluded from Profit. Decisionmaking regarding financing is typically made at the corporate level.Decisions on essential pension items are made centrally. Accordingly Profit primarily includes amounts related to service cost of pension plans only while all other regularly recurring pension related costs are included in reconciliations in line item Centrally carried pension expense.Amortization expenses of intangible assets acquired in business combinations are not part of Profit. Furthermore income taxes are excluded from Profit since income tax is subject to legal structures which typically do not correspond to the structure of the segments. The effect of certain litigation and compliance issues is excluded from Profit if such items are not indicative of performance. This may also be the case for items that refer to more than one reportable segment SRE and or POC or have a corporate or central character. Costs for support functions are primarily allocated to the segments.

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited assurance on the EU Taxonomy disclosure based on our assurance engagement. We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE Revised Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board IAASB. This standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the Companys EU Taxonomy disclosure is not prepared in all material respects in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder as well as the interpretation by management disclosed in the EU Taxonomy disclosure. In a limited assurance engagement the procedures performed are less extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement and accordingly a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The selection of the assurance procedures is subject to the professional judgment of the auditor. In the course of our assurance engagement we have among other things performed the following assurance procedures and other activitiesInquiries of relevant employees for the assessment of the process to identify the Taxonomyeligible and Taxonomyaligned economic activitiesInquiries of the employees responsible for data capture and consolidation as well as the preparation of the EU Taxonomy disclosure about the reporting processes the data capture and compilation methods as well as internal controls to the extent relevant for the limited assurance of the EU Taxonomy disclosureIdentification of likely risks of material misstatement in the EU Taxonomy disclosureAnalytical evaluation of data at the level of the Group and businesses as well as service and governance unitsInquiries and inspection of documents relating to the collection and reporting of dataReconciliation of selected disclosures with the corresponding data in the consolidated financial statements and group management reportEvaluation of the presentation of the EU Taxonomy disclosure.In determining the disclosures in accordance with Art. of the EU Taxonomy Regulation management is required to interpret undefined legal terms. Due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently the legal conformity of their interpretation and accordingly our assurance engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties.
