laboratories results from a combination of societal and market forces that are driving healthcare providers to operate and organize their businesses differently. This development is driven partly by staff shortages societys increasing resistance to healthcare costs the growing professionalization of health insurance and governmental healthcare systems burdens from chronic diseases and the rapid scientific progress. The growing cost pressure will continue to drive new remuneration models for healthcare services such as valuebased reimbursement instead of treatmentbased reimbursement. As a result of these factors theres a trend of consolidation of healthcare providers into networks. The aim of the resulting larger clinic and laboratory chains often operating internationally and acting increasingly like large corporations are systematic improvements in quality while at the same time reducing costs. This development leads to an increased demand for standardized and scalable systems and solutions as well as new business models.RD activities at Siemens Healthineers are aimed at offering innovative and sustainable solutions for diagnostics and therapy to its customers. Artificial intelligence sensors and robotics are focal points of the RD activities at Siemens Healthineers. A growing share of the RD activities is devoted to improving the sustainability of the products. Furthermore the systems of Siemens Healthineers regularly receive extensive software releases to improve user friendliness and add innovative applications. Investments at Siemens Healthineers were mainly for spending for factories to expand manufacturing and technical capabilities in particular in the U.S. and China for measures related to improving operational efficiency and for additions to intangible assets including capitalized development expenses for products within the Atellica product line.
