Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. This risk arises whenever interest terms of financial assets and liabilities are different. In order to manage the Companys position with regard to interest rate risk interest income and interest expenses Corporate Treasury performs a comprehensive corporate interest rate risk management by using fixed or variable interest rates from bond issuances and derivative financial instruments when appropriate. The interest rate risk is mitigated by managing interest rate risk within an integrated Asset Liability Management approach and results primarily from funding in the U.S. dollar British pound and euro. This includes SFS business for which the interest rate risk was formerly managed separately.If there are no conflicting countryspecific regulations all Siemens operating units generally obtain any required financing through Corporate Treasury in the form of loans or intercompany clearing accounts. The same concept is adopted for deposits of cash generated by the units. As of September and the VaR relating to the interest rate was million and million. The decrease was driven mainly by a decrease in interest rate sensitivity for the U.S. dollar and a lower interest rate volatility for the euro.

Entitlements resulting from plans based on asset returns from underlying assets are generally measured at the fair value of the underlying assets at the balance sheet date. If the performance of the underlying assets is lower than a guaranteed return the pension provision is measured by projecting forward the contributions at the guaranteed fixed return and discounting to a present value.According to the Act on the Improvement of Company Pensions Gesetz zur Verbesserung der betrieblichen Altersversorgung Siemens AG is secondarily liable for pension benefits provided under an indirect pension funding vehicle mittelbarer Durchführungsweg. Siemens AG recognizes the underfunding in the item Provisions for pensions and similar commitments as far as the respective assets of the pension fund or of the pension and support fund Pensions und Unterstützungskasse do not cover the settlement amount of the respective pension obligations.Other provisions are recognized in an appropriate and sufficient amount to cover individual obligations for all identifiable risks relating to liabilities of uncertain timing and amount and for anticipated losses on onerous contracts taking account of price and cost increases expected to arise in the future. Provisions for agreed personnel restructuring measures were recognized for legal and constructive obligations. Significant provisions with a remaining term of more than one year are discounted using a discount rate which corresponds to the average market interest rate appropriate for the remaining term of the obligations as calculated and published by Deutsche Bundesbank.Foreign currency translation Receivables other current assets securities cash and cash equivalents provisions and liabilities excluding advance payments received on orders as well as commitments and contingencies denominated in foreign currency are generally measured applying the mean spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Balance Sheet line items denominated in foreign currency which are part of a valuation unit used to hedge foreign currency risk are measured using the mean spot exchange rate on the transaction date. Noncurrent assets and inventories acquired in foreign currency are generally measured applying the mean spot exchange rate on the transaction date.Guarantees and other commitments Siemens AG issues parent company guarantees i.e. guarantees to ensure performance obligations incurred from the delivery of goods or provision of services by affiliated and longterm investee companies or their parent companies. For measurement purposes the contract amount of the secured delivery or service agreement is reduced using the straightline method over the planned term of the delivery or service agreement unless there are reasons for a different risk assessment and an increased liability amount riskadequate liability amount. Credit lines included in the guarantee obligations in the context of financing affiliated companies are recognized at their nominal amount.Derivative financial instruments are used by Siemens AG almost exclusively for hedging purposes and if the relevant conditions are met are aggregated with the underlying hedged item into valuation units. When a valuation unit is created changes in values or cash flows from the hedged item and hedging contract are compared. A provision is recognized only for a negative surplus from the ineffective part of the market value changes. The unrealized gains and losses from the effective part offset each other completely and are not recognized in the Balance Sheet or the Income Statement.Classification of items in the annual financial statements Siemens AG aggregates individual line items of the Income Statement and Balance Sheet if the individual line item is not material for providing a true and fair view of the Companys financial position and if such an aggregation improves the clarity of the presentation.

Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI are equity instruments for which Siemens irrevocably elects to present subsequent fair value changes in OCI at initial recognition of the instrument. Unrealized gains and losses net of deferred income tax expenses as well as gains and losses on the subsequent sale of the instruments are recognized in line item Other comprehensive income net of income taxes.Financial assets measured at amortized cost Loans receivables and other debt instruments held in a holdtocollect business model with contractual cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less valuation allowances for expected credit losses. Valuation allowances are set up for expected credit losses representing a forwardlooking estimate of future credit losses involving significant judgment. Expected credit loss is the gross carrying amount less collateral multiplied by the probability of default and a factor reflecting the loss in the event of default. Valuation allowances are not recognized as far as the gross carrying amount is sufficiently collateralized. Probabilities of default are mainly derived from internal rating grades. A simplified approach is used to assess expected credit losses from trade receivables lease receivables and contract assets by applying their lifetime expected credit losses. The valuation allowance for loans and other longterm debt instruments primarily held at Financial Services SFS is measured according to a threestage impairment approach Stage At inception twelvemonth expected credit losses are recognized based on a twelve months probability of default.Stage If the credit risk of a financial asset increases significantly without being creditimpaired lifetime expected credit losses are recognized based on a lifetime probability of default. A significant increase in credit risk is determined for each individual financial instrument using internal credit ratings. A rating deterioration does not trigger a transfer into Stage if the credit rating remains within the investment grade range. More than days past due payments will not be transferred into Stage if the delay is not creditriskrelated. Stage If the financial asset is creditimpaired valuation allowances equal lifetime expected credit losses. A financial asset is considered creditimpaired when there is observable information about significant financial difficulties and a high vulnerability to default however the definition of default is not yet met. Impairment triggers include liquidity problems a request for debt restructuring or a breach of contract. A creditrisk driven contractual modification always results in a creditimpaired financial asset.Financial assets are written off as uncollectible if recovery appears unlikely. Generally if the limitation period expired when a debtors sworn statement of affairs is received or when the receivable is not pursued due to its minor value. Receivables are written off when bankruptcy proceedings close.A financial asset is derecognized when the rights to cash flows expire or the financial asset is transferred to another party. Significant modifications of contractual terms of a financial asset measured at amortized cost result in derecognition and recognition of a new financial asset for insignificant modifications the carrying amount of the financial asset is adjusted without derecognition. Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with less than three months maturity from the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are measured at cost.Loan Commitments Expected credit losses for irrevocable loan commitments are determined using the threestage impairment approach for financial assets measured at amortized cost and recognized as a liability.Financial liabilities except for derivative financial instruments Siemens measures financial liabilities at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts are measured at fair value unless they are designated as hedging instruments for which hedge accounting is applied. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized either in net income or in the case of a cash flow hedge in line item Other comprehensive income net of income taxes applicable deferred income tax. Certain derivative instruments embedded in host contracts are also accounted for separately as derivatives.Fair value hedges The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted by the gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk. Where an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as hedged item the subsequent cumulative change in its fair value is recognized as a separate financial asset or liability with corresponding gain or loss recognized in net income. For hedged items carried at amortized cost the adjustment is amortized until maturity of the hedged item. For hedged firm commitments the initial carrying amount of the assets or liabilities that result from meeting the firm commitments are adjusted to include the cumulative changes in the fair value that were previously recognized as separate financial assets or liabilities. Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recognized in line item Other comprehensive income net of income taxes and any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in net income. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified into net income in the same periods in which the hedged item affects net income.Sharebased payment Sharebased payment awards at Siemens are predominately designed as equitysettled. Fair value is measured at grant date and is expensed over the vesting period. Fair value is determined as the price of the underlying shares considering dividends during the vesting period the grantees are not entitled to as well as market conditions and nonvesting conditions if applicable. Plans granting the rights to receive subsidiary shares constitute own shares and accordingly are accounted as equitysettled.Insurance contracts In June the IASB issued IFRS Insurance contracts IFRS effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January . Siemens will adopt the standard commencing with fiscal . IFRS introduces and applies uniform accounting policies for insurance contracts and supersedes IFRS Insurance contracts. The adoption of IFRS is not expected to have a significant impact on Siemens Consolidated Financial Statements.Prioryear information The presentation of certain prioryear information has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
