Cash outflows from changes in operating net working capital were due mainly to Siemens Healthineers which recorded a significant buildup of trade and other receivables as well as inventories due in part to the expected growth of business activities in coming quarters. Cash outflows for purchase of investments and financial assets for investment purposes included additions of assets eligible as central bank collateral and payments for debt or equity investments.Cash outflows from change in receivables from financing activities of SFS related primarily to SFSs debt business.Cash inflows from other disposals of assets included mainly proceeds from disposals of assets eligible as central bank collateral from the sale of the Commercial Vehicles business by Portfolio Companies and from the sale or disposal of debt or equity investments. Cash outflows from the reissuance of treasury shares and other transactions with owners were driven by the purchase of Siemens Healthineers AG treasury shares. ,,0.31795585465183623,0.36249590382397034,,0.3947060908786752,,0.39850932749016754,,,,0.491739058055899,,,0.41254378388116336,,,,,

Investing activitiesAdditions to intangible assets and property plant and equipment from continuing operations totaled . billion in fiscal . Within the industrial businesses ongoing investments related mainly to technological innovations maintaining extending and digitalizing our capacities for designing manufacturing and marketing new solutions improving productivity and replacements of fixed assets. These investments amounted to . billion in fiscal . The remaining portion related mainly to Siemens Real Estate including significant amounts for projects such as new office buildings in Germany and Spain. Siemens Real Estate is responsible for uniform and comprehensive management of Company real estate worldwide except for Siemens Healthineers and supports the industrial businesses and corporate activities with customerspecific real estate solutions.With regard to capital expenditures we expect a significant increase in fiscal . In the context of the billion investment strategy presented in fiscal to strengthen growth innovation and resilience significant amounts will be invested in the coming years for the construction and expansion of hightech production facilities in the U.S. China and Singapore. As part of this investment strategy Siemens also announced the establishment of its new Technology Campus in Erlangen Germany to expand development and manufacturing capacities. In addition up to . billion are to be invested in Siemensstadt Square. This project initiated in fiscal aims to transform Siemens existing industrial area in Berlin into a modern urban district supporting a diverse range of purposes including strengthening key technologies. Further investments are planned in relation to new office buildings including Siemens Campus Erlangen. Furthermore we continue to invest in attractive innovation fields through Next our global venture capital unit.,,,,0.404924515466764,,0.3779798398381615,,,,,,,,,,,,,

115,Supply chain management The financial performance of our operating units depends on reliable and effective supply chain management for components subassemblies energy critical parts e.g. semiconductors and materials. Capacity constraints and supply shortages resulting from ineffective supply chain management may lead to production bottlenecks delivery delays quality issues and additional costs. We also rely on third parties to supply us with parts components and services. Using third parties to manufacture assemble and test our products may reduce our control over manufacturing yields quality assurance product delivery schedules and costs. Although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid supplyrelated problems there can be no assurance that we will not encounter supply problems in the future especially if we use singlesource suppliers for critical components. Shortages and delays could materially harm our businesses. Unanticipated increases in the price of components or raw materials due to market shortages or other reasons could also adversely affect performance. Furthermore we may be exposed to the risk of delays and interruptions in the supply chain as a consequence of catastrophic events including pandemics geopolitical uncertainties energy shortages sabotage cyber incidents suppliers financial difficulties or suppliers not meeting our standards particularly if we are unable to identify alternative sources of supply or means of transportation in a timely manner or at all. Besides other measures we mitigate price fluctuation in global raw material markets with various hedging instruments.Internal programs and initiatives We are in a continuous process of operational optimization and constantly engage in costreduction initiatives including ongoing capacity adjustment measures and structural initiatives. Consolidation of business activities and manufacturing facilities outsourcings joint ventures and the streamlining of product portfolios are all part of these costreduction efforts. These measures may not be implemented as planned may turn out to be less effective than anticipated may become effective later than estimated or may not become effective at all. Any future contribution of these measures to our profitability will be influenced by the actual savings achieved and by our ability to sustain them. In case of restructuring and outsourcing activities there could be delays in product deliveries or we might even experience delivery failures. Furthermore delays in critical RD projects could lead to negative impacts in running projects. We constantly control and monitor the progress of these projects and initiatives using standardized controlling and milestone tracking approaches.Shortage of skilled personnel Competition for diverse and highly qualified personnel such as specialists and experts in technical fields remains intense in the industries and regions in which our businesses operate. We have ongoing demand for highly skilled people and a need to enhance diversity inclusion and sense of belonging in our workforce. Our future success depends in part on our continued ability to attract engineers tech talent and other qualified personnel. We address these topics for example by strengthening the capabilities and skills of our talent acquisition teams and a strategy of proactive search for people with the required capabilities in our respective industries and markets. In fiscal we rolled out our new Employer Branding in all our recruiting marketing activities and started a media campaign with focus on tech talent in our key markets. Technology and digitalization help us to be more effective in attracting and selecting diverse talent. In addition we have a focus on diversity and structured succession planning. As with our existing people we must also provide new talent with opportunities to grow and bond especially soon after they join us. This appears especially relevant at a time of new increasingly virtual working environments.Projectrelated risks A number of our segments conduct activities under longterm contracts that are awarded on a competitive bidding basis. Such contracts typically arise at Mobility and in various activities of Smart Infrastructure or Portfolio Companies. Some of these contracts are inherently risky because we may assume substantially all of the risks associated with completing a project and meeting postcompletion warranty obligations. For example we may face the risk that we must satisfy technical requirements of a project even though we have not gained experience with those requirements before winning the project. The profit margins realized on fixedpriced contracts may vary from original estimates as a result of changes in costs and productivity over a contracts term. We sometimes bear the risk of unanticipated project modifications shortage of key personnel quality problems financial difficulties of our customers andor significant partners cost overruns or contractual penalties caused by unexpected technological problems unexpected developments at the project sites unforeseen changes or difficulties in the regulatory or political environment performance problems with our suppliers subcontractors and consortium partners or other logistical difficulties. Some of our multiyear contracts also contain demanding installation and maintenance requirements in addition to other performance criteria relating to timing unit cost and compliance with government regulations which if not satisfied could subject us to substantial contractual penalties damages nonpayment and contract termination. There can be no assurance that contracts and projects in particular those with longterm duration and fixedprice calculation can be completed profitably. To tackle those risks we established a global project management organization to systematically improve the technical and commercial capabilities of our project management personnel. For complex projects we conduct dedicated risk assessments in very early stages of the sales phase before we decide to hand over a binding offer to our customers. ,,,0.3550251438649202,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
118,in central bank policies could therefore negatively impact our financial results. Market prices show higher volatility than in the past due to increased macroeconomic uncertainties resulting from inflation geopolitical tensions and other factors noted above.Liquidity and financing risks Our treasury and financing activities could face adverse deposit andor financing conditions from negative developments related to financial markets such as limited availability of funds and hedging instruments an updated evaluation of our solvency particularly from rating agencies negative interest rates and impacts arising from more restrictive regulation of the financial sector central bank policy or the usage of financial instruments. Widening credit spreads due to uncertainty and risk aversion in the financial markets might lead to adverse changes in the market values of our financial assets in particular our derivative financial instruments.Credit risks We provide our customers with various forms of direct and indirect financing of orders and projects including guarantees. Siemens Financial Services in particular bears credit risks due to such financing activities if for example customers do not meet obligations arising from these financing arrangements meet them only partially or meet them late. The credit environment has become more dynamic due to a more uncertain macroeconomic outlook e.g. inflation and geopolitical tensions.For further information on postemployment benefits derivative financial instruments hedging activities financial risk management and related measures see Notes and in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal .,,,,,,,,,,,0.4527488541749136,,,,,,,,
120,Changes of regulations laws and policies Regulatory requirements are being introduced or modified at an unprecedented rate often with little or no advance implementation lead time. This creates a risk that new requirements become effective more quickly than they can be implemented in the associated systems and processes potentially resulting in business disruptions and the need for manual mitigation interventions. As a diversified company with global businesses we are exposed to various product and countryrelated regulations laws and policies influencing our business activities and processes. According to observations and analysis there is an increasing risk that existing technical regulations in target markets will suddenly change or new ones will be set in force which result in market access criteria that our products do not meet. The affected products would lose marketability in this market. Reducing the risk of a salesstop depends on the required correction for the nonconformity. In case the product can technically stay as is while it has to undergo new and additional conformity assessment and certification there will be considerable effort and cost to carry out the needed testing and certification procedures. In a worse case the affected product will need reengineering or redesign to meet the requirements of the changed or new technical regulation even before it can become reassessed and certified for market approval. The latter case will cause significant extra effort and cost to make the needed product changes and to maintain the countryspecific product variant as an additional derivative item in the portfolio. In the worst case if the two aforementioned ways of maintaining the products marketability prove to be not feasible we must stop selling the affected product in the market. The uncertain geopolitical situation has triggered unpredictable and often conflicting extraterritorial regulations restrictions and sanctions thus creating a potential risk that it will be difficult to simultaneously comply with all relevant regulatory requirements of certain transactions. Complex crossjurisdictional regulations can vary between countries even within the same region each with slightly different rules and requirements creating a risk that a global standard cannot be effectively implemented and maintained potentially leading to a need for more custom or regional standards. We monitor the political and regulatory landscape in all our key markets to anticipate potential problem areas with the aim of quickly adjusting our business activities and processes to changed conditions. However any changes in regulations laws and policies could adversely affect our business activities and processes as well as our financial condition and results of operations. Current and future investigations regarding allegations of corruption of antitrust violations and of other violations of law Proceedings against us or our business partners regarding allegations of corruption of antitrust violations and of other violations of law may lead to fines as well as penalties sanctions injunctions against future conduct profit disgorgements disqualifications from directly and indirectly engaging in certain types of business the loss of business licenses or permits other restrictions and legal consequences as well as negative public media coverage. Accordingly we may among other things be required to comply with potential obligations and liabilities arising in connection with such investigations and proceedings including potential tax penalties. Moreover any findings related to public corruption that are not covered by the and corruption charge settlements which we concluded with U.S. and German authorities may endanger our business with government agencies and intergovernmental and supranational organizations. Monitors could again be appointed to review future business practices and we may otherwise be required to further modify our business practices and our compliance program.In its global business Siemens does part of its business with stateowned enterprises and governments. We also participate in projects funded by government agencies and intergovernmental and supranational organizations such as multilateral development banks. Ongoing or potential future investigations into allegations of corruption antitrust violations or other violations of law could as well impair relationships with such parties or could result in our exclusion from public contracts. Such investigations may also adversely affect existing private business relationships and our ability to pursue potentially important strategic projects and transactions such as strategic alliances joint ventures or other business alliances or could result in the cancellation of certain of our existing contracts. Moreover third parties including our competitors could initiate significant litigation.In addition future developments in ongoing and potential future investigations such as responding to the requests of governmental authorities and cooperating with them could divert managements attention and resources from other issues facing our business. Furthermore we might be exposed to compliance risks in connection with recently acquired operations that are in the ongoing process of integration. Along with other measures Siemens has established a global compliance organization that conducts compliance risk mitigation processes such as Compliance Risk Assessments among others or initiates audit activities performed by the internal assurance department. Sanctions and export control As a globally operating organization we conduct business with customers in countries which are subject to export control regulations embargoes economic sanctions debarment policies or other forms of trade restrictions hereafter referred to as sanctions imposed by the U.S. the EU China or other countries or organizations. New or expanded sanctions in countries in which we do business may result in a curtailment of our existing business in such countries or indirectly in other countries. We are also aware of policies of national authorities and institutional investors such as pension funds or insurance companies requiring divestment of interests in and prohibiting investment in and transactions with entities doing business with countries identified by the U.S. Department of State as ,,,0.3699389408498527,,,,0.45270801485108353,,,,,,,,,,,,
121,state sponsors of terrorism. As a result it is possible that such policies may result in our inability to gain or retain certain investors or customers. In addition the termination of our activities in sanctioned countries may expose us to customer claims and other actions. Our reputation could also suffer due to our activities with counterparties in or affiliated with these countries or due to unauthorized diversion of our products to restricted parties or destinations. Siemens addresses these risks by maintaining a comprehensive and robust control program.Protectionism including tariffstrade war Protectionist trade policies decoupling and changes in the political and regulatory environment in the markets in which we operate such as import and export controls tariffs and other trade barriers including debarment from certain markets inbound and outbound investment screenings and price or exchange controls could affect our business in national markets and could impact our business situation financial position and results of operations we may also be exposed to penalties other sanctions and reputational damage. In addition the uncertainty of the legal environment in some regions could limit our ability to enforce our rights and subject us to increasing costs related to adjusting our compliance programs.Environmental health safety and other governmental regulations Some of the industries in which we operate are highly regulated. Current and future environmental health safety and other governmental regulations or changes thereto may require us to change the way we run our operations and could result in significant increases in our operating or production costs. Furthermore we see the risk of potential environmental health or safety incidents as well as potential noncompliance with environmental health or safety regulations affecting Siemens and our contractors or subsuppliers resulting for example in serious injuries business interruptions penalties loss of reputation and internal or external investigations.In addition while we have procedures in place to ensure compliance with applicable governmental regulations in the conduct of our business operations it cannot be excluded that violations of applicable governmental regulations may be caused either by us or by third parties that we contract with including suppliers or service providers whose activities may be attributed to us. Any such violations particularly expose us to the risk of liability penalties fines reputational damage or loss of licenses or permits that are important to our business operations. In particular we could also face liability for damage or remediation for environmental contamination at the facilities we design or operate. With regard to certain environmental risks we maintain liability insurance at levels that our management believes are appropriate and consistent with industry practice. We may incur environmental losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of such insurance and such losses may have an adverse effect on our business situation financial condition and results of operations. Current or future litigation and legal and regulatory proceedings Siemens is and potentially will be involved in numerous legal disputes and proceedings in various jurisdictions. These legal disputes and proceedings could result in particular in Siemens being subject to payment of damages and punitive damages equitable remedies or sanctions fines or disgorgement of profit. In individual cases this may also lead to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits. Asserted claims are generally subject to interest rates. Some of these legal disputes and proceedings could result in adverse decisions for Siemens or decisions assessments or requirements of regulatory authorities could deviate from our expectations which may have material effects on our business activities as well as our financial position results of operations and cash flows. Siemens maintains liability insurance for certain legal risks at levels our management believes are appropriate and consistent with industry practice. However the insurance policy does not protect Siemens against in particular reputational damage. Moreover Siemens may incur losses relating to legal disputes and proceedings beyond the limits or outside the coverage of such insurance or exceeding any provisions made for losses related to legal disputes and proceedings. Finally there can be no assurance that Siemens will be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms in the future.For additional information with respect to specific proceedings see Note in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal .,,,0.36225579218194126,0.3568925121406273,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

125,Within our ERM we regularly identify evaluate and respond to opportunities that present themselves in our various fields of activity. Below we describe our most significant opportunities. Unless otherwise stated the opportunities described relate to all organizational units. The order in which the opportunities are presented reflects the currently estimated relative exposure for Siemens associated with these opportunities and thus provides an indication of the opportunities current importance to us. The described opportunities are not necessarily the only ones we encounter. In addition our assessment of opportunities is subject to change because the Company our markets and technologies are constantly advancing. It is also possible that opportunities we see today will never materialize.Favorable political and regulatory environment including sustainability A favorable political and regulatory environment including the transition towards a lowcarbon economy could restore a more positive industrial investment sentiment that supports the growth of our markets. In addition government initiatives and subsidies including tax reforms green and digital recovery plans RD among others lead to more government spending e.g. infrastructure healthcare mobility or digitalization investments and may ultimately result in an opportunity for us to participate in ways that increase our revenue and profit. Investments to strengthen countries resilience energy and food security as well as to diversify value chains close to major markets reshoring nearshoring can present opportunities to businesses. By enabling our customers to reduce their greenhouse gas GHG emissions using our portfolio and by reducing CO emission in our own operations Siemens strives to support the transition towards a lowcarbon economy.

140,On a geographical basis of revenue was generated in the Europe C.I.S. Africa Middle East region in the Asia Australia region and in the Americas region. Exports from Germany accounted for of overall revenue. In fiscal orders for Siemens AG amounted to . billion. The increases in revenue cost of sales and research and development expenses were most evident at Digital Industries.The RD intensity RD costs as a percentage of revenue was . slightly above the level in fiscal . The RD activities of Siemens AG are fundamentally the same as for its corresponding business activities within the Siemens Group. RD expensesin both periods related mainly to Digital Industries. On an average basis Siemens AG employed people in RD in fiscal . The increase in selling and general administrative expenses was due mainly to higher selling expenses led by Digital Industries.Other operating income expenses net included mainly a loss of . billion from a disposal in connection with the carveout of business activities into the Innomotics GmbH partly offset by . billion income from an intragroup service contract.

164,The key performance indicators KPI in this section were determined based on Commission Delegated Regulation EU in conjunction with the International Financial Reporting Standards applicable for the Consolidated Financial Statements. For calculating the eligibility and alignment KPIs Siemens business activities and associated revenue capital expenditures CapEx and operating expenditures OpEx were predominantly directly mapped to an applicable economic activity listed in the Commission Delegated Acts in connection with EU regulation . For the calculation of CapEx and OpEx allocations were also made based on the revenue of the Taxonomyeligible and aligned activities. To avoid double counting a mapping was always made to one economic activity only. Following the eligibility assessment the alignment with Substantial Contribution criteria for all eligible business activities was assessed and documented based on appropriate reporting hierarchy levels such as businesssegment productfamily or project level. Once a business activity demonstrated Substantial Contribution the Do No Significant Harm DNSH criteria were assessed together with technical experts on the product site project andor supplier level. For fiscal EU Taxonomy reporting is limited to the first two environmental objectives climate change mitigation and climate change adaption. Based on its implemented groupwide structures on risk analysis corporate guidelines and due diligence processes and mechanisms Siemens fulfills the Minimum Safeguards requirements which comprise the areas of human rights anticorruption and bribery taxation and fair competition.Revenue KPIThe revenue KPI shows the ratio of revenue from Taxonomyeligible andor aligned economic activities to the total revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the reporting year. Based on an assessment of the Siemens business portfolio Taxonomyeligible revenue accounted for . and Taxonomyaligned revenue for . of total revenue. This translates into . billion in Taxonomyeligible revenue and . billion in aligned revenue.Taxonomyeligible and aligned economic activities were primarily driven by the i Manufacture of lowcarbon technologies for transport Climate Change Mitigation CCM . ii rail transportation infrastructure CCM . iii Infrastructure enabling lowcarbon road transport and public transport CCM . all associated with Mobility businesses as well as iv energyefficient building technologies CCM . and v services for energyefficient building technologies CCM . both related to Smart Infrastructure businesses.The difference between Taxonomyeligible revenue and Taxonomyaligned revenue is mainly due to DNSH criteria related to pollution prevention as part of Appendix C which go beyond existing national regulation. This is mainly because additionally required documentation is not completely available yet.Capital expenditures KPIThe CapEx KPI shows the ratio of CapEx from Taxonomyeligible andor aligned economic activities to the total CapEx reflecting additions including additions from business combinations to other intangible assets and property plant and equipment in accordance with Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the reporting year . . billion of Siemens CapEx were eligible and . . billion were aligned. The aligned CapEx is composed as follows a majority of . billion is related to additions to property plant and equipment the remainder pertains to internally generated intangible assets and capitalized rightofuse assets.This aligned CapEx includes million related to a CapEx plan associated with building projects to be finalized by fiscal summing up to a planned total volume of . billion capitalizable and noncapitalizable costs. The buildings are designed to minimize energy use and carbon emissions CCM ..Acquisition and ownership of buildings CCM . related to Siemens real estate portfolio represents the largest portion in overall CapEx eligibility. The difference between Taxonomyeligible CapEx and Taxonomyaligned CapEx is impacted by i only partial availability of information on energy performance certificates for our global portfolio and ii energy certificates below the required threshold defined in the Substantial Contribution criteria for the energy efficiency of buildings.Operating expenditures KPIThe OpEx KPI shows the ratio of OpEx from Taxonomyeligible andor aligned economic activities to total OpEx. The total OpEx comprises direct noncapitalized costs related to research and development building renovation measures shortterm leases maintenance and repairs and any other direct expenditures relating to the daytoday servicing of assets of property plant and equipment per Annex I of the Commission Delegated Regulation EU . Accordingly . . billion of Siemens OpEx were eligible and . . billion were aligned.The majority of eligible andor aligned expenditures relate to processes and assets associated with the economic activities described for the revenue KPI i Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport CCM . and ii rail transportation infrastructure CCM .. These two activities account for half of eligible OpEx and the majority of aligned OpEx.This aligned OpEx includes million related to a CapEx plan associated with building projects to be finalized by fiscal summing up to a planned total volume of . billion capitalizable and noncapitalizable costs. The buildings are designed to minimize energy use and carbon emissions CCM ..Corresponding to revenue the difference between Taxonomyeligible OpEx and Taxonomyaligned OpEx relates mainly to the documentation of DNSH criteria for pollution prevention Appendix C.,,0.33505402910272464,0.39415565570676575,,,,0.38870260934142187,,,,,,,,,,,,

201,Foreign currency transaction Transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of an entity are recorded at that functional currency applying the spot exchange rate at the date when the underlying transactions are initially recognized. At the end of the reporting period foreign currencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities are revalued to functional currency applying the spot exchange rate prevailing at that date. Gains and losses arising from these foreign currency revaluations are recognized in net income. Those foreign currencydenominated transactions which are classified as nonmonetary are remeasured using the historical spot exchange rate.Revenue recognition Siemens recognizes revenue when or as control over distinct goods or services is transferred to the customer i.e. when the customer is able to direct the use of the transferred goods or services and obtains substantially all of the remaining benefits provided a contract with enforceable rights and obligations exists and amongst others collectability of consideration is probable taking our customers creditworthiness into account. Revenue is the transaction price Siemens expects to be entitled to. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur once associated uncertainties are resolved. The amount of variable consideration is calculated by either using the expected value or the most likely amount depending on which is expected to better predict the amount of variable consideration. Consideration is adjusted for the time value of money if the period between the transfer of goods or services and the receipt of payment exceeds twelve months and there is a significant financing benefit either to the customer or Siemens. If a contract contains more than one distinct good or service the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices. If standalone selling prices are not observable the Company reasonably estimates those. Revenue is recognized for each performance obligation either at a point in time or over time.Revenues from constructiontype contracts Revenues are recognized over time under the percentageofcompletion method based on the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs. An expected loss on the contract is recognized as an expense immediately. Payment terms are usually days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms. The percentageofcompletion method places considerable importance on accurate estimates of the extent of progress towards completion and may involve estimates on the scope of deliveries and services required to fulfill the contractually defined obligations. These significant estimates include total estimated costs total estimated revenues contract risks including technical political and regulatory risks risks from supply chain constraints and other judgments. Under the percentageofcompletion method changes in estimates may lead to an increase or decrease of revenue. In addition Siemens needs to assess whether the contract is expected to continue or whether it is terminated. In determining whether the continuation or termination of a contract is expected to be the most likely scenario all relevant facts and circumstances relating to the contract are considered on an individual basis. Revenues from maintenance and service contracts Revenues are recognized over time on a straightline basis or if the performance pattern is other than straightline as services are provided i.e. under the percentageofcompletion method as described above. Payment terms are usually days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms. Revenues from product sales Revenues are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods passes to the buyer usually upon delivery of the goods. Invoices are issued at that point in time and are usually payable within days.Revenues from software contracts Software contracts usually comprise the sale of subscription licenses and perpetual licenses which are both onpremise as well as technical support services including updates and unspecified upgrades and the sale of softwareasaservice. Subscription contracts generally contain two separate performance obligations timebased software license and technical support service. Revenues for perpetual and timebased licenses granting the customer a right to use Siemens intellectual property are recognized at a point in time i.e. when control of the license passes to the customer. Revenues for technical support services including updates and unspecified upgrades are recognized over time on a straightline basis as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by Siemens services. Softwareasaservice contracts including related cloud services represent one performance obligation for which revenues are recognized over time on a straightline basis. Payment terms for all transactions are usually days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms. Income from interest Interest is recognized using the effective interest method. Functional costs In general operating expenses by types are assigned to the functions following the functional area of the corresponding profit and cost centers. Amortization depreciation and impairment of intangible assets and property plant and equipment are included in functional costs depending on the use of the assets.Productrelated expenses Provisions for estimated costs related to product warranties are recorded in line item Cost of sales at the time the related sale is recognized.Research and development costs Costs of research activities are expensed as incurred. Costs of development activities are capitalized when the recognition criteria in IAS are met. Capitalized development costs are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses with an amortization period of generally three to years. Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations and net income all attributable to ordinary shareholders of Siemens AG by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by assuming conversion or exercise of all potentially dilutive securities and sharebased payment plans.Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized instead goodwill is tested for impairment annually as well as whenever there are events or changes in circumstances triggering events which suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of a cashgenerating unit or a group of cashgenerating units generally represented by a segment. Siemens Healthineers is tested one level below the segment. This is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.For the purpose of impairment testing goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the group of cashgenerating units that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. If the carrying amount of the group of cashgenerating units to which the goodwill is allocated exceeds its recoverable amount an impairment loss on goodwill allocated to that group of cashgenerating units is recognized. The recoverable amount is the higher of the group of cashgenerating units fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If either of these values exceeds the carrying amount it is not always necessary to determine both values. These ,,,,,,0.39730658294944804,0.44301806634792834,,,,,,,0.39903152078565024,,,,,

204,Impairment of property plant and equipment and other intangible assets The Company reviews property plant and equipment and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In addition intangible assets not yet available for use are subject to an annual impairment test. Impairment testing of property plant and equipment and other intangible assets involves the use of estimates in determining the assets recoverable amount which can have a material impact on the respective values and ultimately the amount of any impairment. Leases A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Further information on leases can be found in Notes and .Lessor Leases are classified as either finance or operating leases determined based on whether substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset are transferred. If this is the case the lease is classified as a finance lease if not it is an operating lease. Receivables from finance leases are recognized at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. The assets underlying the operating leases are presented in Property plant and equipment and depreciated on a straightline basis over their useful lives or to their estimated residual value. Operating lease income is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term.Lessee Siemens recognizes rightofuse assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of more than twelve months if the underlying asset is not of low value. Payments for shortterm and lowvalue leases are expensed over the lease term. Extension options are included in the lease term if their exercise is reasonably certain. Rightofuse assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation expense and impairment losses adjusted for any remeasurements. Rightofuse assets are depreciated under the straightline method over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the underlying assets. Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments due over the lease term generally discounted using the incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. They are remeasured in case of modifications or reassessments of the lease.Discontinued operations and noncurrent assets held for disposal Discontinued operations are reported when a component of an entity is classified as held for disposal or has been disposed of if the component represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan to disposal. A noncurrent asset or a disposal group is held for disposal if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction or through a distribution to owners rather than through continuing use. Depreciation and amortization cease for assets classified as held for disposal. In the Consolidated Statements of Income and of Cash Flows discontinued operations are reported separately from continuing operations prior periods are presented on a comparable basis. The disclosures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements outside of Note relate to continuing operations or assets and liabilities not held for disposal. The noncurrent asset held for disposal or the disposal group is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The determination of the fair value less costs to sell includes the use of estimates and assumptions that tend to be uncertain. Income taxes Tax positions are calculated taking into consideration the respective local tax laws relevant court decisions and applicable tax authorities views. Tax regulations can be complex and possibly subject to different interpretations of tax payers and local tax authorities. Different interpretations of existing or new tax laws as a result of tax reforms or other tax legislative procedures may result in additional tax payments for prior years and are taken into account based on managements considerations. Under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected tax consequences of future periods attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are recognized if sufficient future taxable profit is available including income from forecasted operating earnings the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and available tax planning opportunities that Siemens would execute. As of each periodend Siemens evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on taxable income of past periods and projected future taxable profits. As future developments are uncertain and partly beyond Siemenss control assumptions are necessary to estimate future taxable profits as well as the period in which deferred tax assets will recover. Estimates are revised in the period in which there is sufficient evidence to revise the assumption. ,,,,0.39792234991161946,0.4045169673043117,0.374743310809701,,,,,,0.43252989813939036,,,,,,,
205,Expected tax effects arising from prospectively applying the global minimum taxation rules Pillar Two are not considered in calculating deferred tax assets and liabilities. Currently it is expected to apply Pillar Two to the entire Siemens Group commencing with fiscal .Contract assets contract liabilities receivables When either party to a contract with customers has performed Siemens presents a contract asset a contract liability or a receivable depending on the relationship between Siemens performance and the customers payment. Contract assets and liabilities are presented as current since incurred in the normal operating cycle. Receivables are recognized when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Valuation allowances for credit risks are made for contract assets and receivables in accordance with the accounting policy for financial assets measured at amortized cost.Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of acquisition or production costs and net realizable value costs being generally determined based on an average or firstin firstout method. Determining net realizable value of inventories involves accounting estimates for quantity technical and price risks.Defined benefit plans Siemens measures the entitlements by applying the projected unit credit method. The approach reflects an actuarially calculated net present value of the future benefit entitlement for services already rendered. In determining the net present value of the future benefit entitlement for service already rendered Defined Benefit Obligation DBO the expected rates of salary and pension increases are considered. The assumptions used for the calculation of the DBO as of the periodend of the preceding fiscal year are used to determine the calculation of service cost and interest income and expense of the following year. Significant plans apply individual spot rates from full discount rate curves to determine service cost and interest expense. The net interest income or expense for the fiscal year will be based on the discount rate for the respective year multiplied by the net defined benefit liability asset at the preceding fiscal years periodend date.Service cost past service cost and settlement gains losses for pensions and similar obligations as well as administration costs unrelated to the management of plan assets are allocated among functional costs. Past service cost and settlement gains losses are recognized immediately in profit or loss. For unfunded plans the amount in line item Provisions for pensions and similar obligations equals the DBO. For funded plans Siemens offsets the fair value of the plan assets from the DBO. Siemens recognizes the net amount after adjustments for effects relating to any asset ceiling.Remeasurements comprise actuarial gains and losses as well as the difference between the return on plan assets and the amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability asset. They are recognized in Other comprehensive income net of income taxes.Actuarial valuations rely on key assumptions including discount rates expected compensation increases rate of pension progression and mortality rates. Discount rates used are determined by reference to yields on highquality corporate bonds of appropriate duration and currency at the end of the reporting period. In case such yields are not available discount rates are based on government bonds yields. Due to changing market economic and social conditions the underlying key assumptions may differ from actual developments.Entitlements resulting from plans based on asset returns from underlying assets are generally measured at the fair value of the underlying assets at periodend. If the performance of the underlying assets is lower than a guaranteed return the DBO is measured by projecting forward the contributions at the guaranteed fixed return and discounting back to a present value. Provisions A provision is recognized in the Statement of Financial Position when it is probable that the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect is material provisions are recognized at present value by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. When a contract becomes onerous the present obligation under the contract is recognized as a provision.Significant estimates are involved in the determination of provisions related to onerous contracts warranty costs asset retirement obligations legal and regulatory proceedings as well as governmental investigations Legal Proceedings. Siemens records a provision for onerous contracts with customers when current estimates of total estimated costs exceed estimated revenue. Onerous contracts with customers are identified by monitoring the progress of the project and updating the estimates which requires significant judgment relating to achieving certain performance standards as well as estimates involving warranty costs and estimates regarding project delays including the assessment of responsibility splits between the contract partners for these delays. Legal Proceedings often involve complex legal issues and are subject to substantial uncertainties. Accordingly considerable judgment is part of determining whether it is probable that there is a present obligation as a result of a past event at the end of the reporting period whether it is probable that such a Legal Proceeding will result in an outflow of resources and whether the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Internal and external counsels are generally part of the determination process. Due to new developments it may be necessary to record a provision for an ongoing Legal Proceeding or to adjust the amount of a previously recognized provision. Upon resolution of a Legal Proceeding Siemens may incur charges in excess of the recorded provisions for such matters. The outcome of Legal Proceedings may have a material effect on Siemens financial position its results of operations andor its cash flows.Termination benefits Termination benefits are provided as a result of an entitys offer made in order to encourage voluntary redundancy before the regular retirement date or from an entitys decision to terminate the employment. Termination benefits in accordance with IAS Employee Benefits are recognized as a liability and an expense when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits.Financial instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Based on their contractual cash flow characteristics and the business model they are held in financial instruments are classified as financial assets and financial liabilities measured at cost or amortized cost measured at fair value loan commitments contract assets and receivables from finance leases. Regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are accounted for at the trade date. Initially financial instruments are recognized at fair value and net of transaction costs if not categorized at FVTPL. Subsequently financial assets and liabilities are measured according to the category to which they are assigned toFinancial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss FVTPL a mandatorily measured at FVTPL Debt financial assets are measured at FVTPL if the business model they are held in is not a holdtocollect or a holdandsell business model or if their contractual cash flows do not represent solely payments of principal and interest. Equity instruments are measured at FVTPL unless the FVOCIoption is elected. b Financial assets designated as measured at FVTPL are irrevocably designated at initial recognition if the designation significantly reduces accounting mismatches that would otherwise arise if assets and liabilities as well as recognizing gains losses were measured on different bases.,,,,,,0.37310494005286365,0.40965098446352316,,,,,,,,,,,,
206,Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI are equity instruments for which Siemens irrevocably elects to present subsequent fair value changes in OCI at initial recognition of the instrument. Unrealized gains and losses net of deferred income tax expenses as well as gains and losses on the subsequent sale of the instruments are recognized in line item Other comprehensive income net of income taxes.Financial assets measured at amortized cost Loans receivables and other debt instruments held in a holdtocollect business model with contractual cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less valuation allowances for expected credit losses. Valuation allowances are set up for expected credit losses representing a forwardlooking estimate of future credit losses involving significant judgment. Expected credit loss is the gross carrying amount less collateral multiplied by the probability of default and a factor reflecting the loss in the event of default. Valuation allowances are not recognized as far as the gross carrying amount is sufficiently collateralized. Probabilities of default are mainly derived from internal rating grades. A simplified approach is used to assess expected credit losses from trade receivables lease receivables and contract assets by applying their lifetime expected credit losses. The valuation allowance for loans and other longterm debt instruments primarily held at Financial Services SFS is measured according to a threestage impairment approach Stage At inception twelvemonth expected credit losses are recognized based on a twelve months probability of default.Stage If the credit risk of a financial asset increases significantly without being creditimpaired lifetime expected credit losses are recognized based on a lifetime probability of default. A significant increase in credit risk is determined for each individual financial instrument using internal credit ratings. A rating deterioration does not trigger a transfer into Stage if the credit rating remains within the investment grade range. More than days past due payments will not be transferred into Stage if the delay is not creditriskrelated. Stage If the financial asset is creditimpaired valuation allowances equal lifetime expected credit losses. A financial asset is considered creditimpaired when there is observable information about significant financial difficulties and a high vulnerability to default however the definition of default is not yet met. Impairment triggers include liquidity problems a request for debt restructuring or a breach of contract. A creditrisk driven contractual modification always results in a creditimpaired financial asset.Financial assets are written off as uncollectible if recovery appears unlikely. Generally if the limitation period expired when a debtors sworn statement of affairs is received or when the receivable is not pursued due to its minor value. Receivables are written off when bankruptcy proceedings close.A financial asset is derecognized when the rights to cash flows expire or the financial asset is transferred to another party. Significant modifications of contractual terms of a financial asset measured at amortized cost result in derecognition and recognition of a new financial asset for insignificant modifications the carrying amount of the financial asset is adjusted without derecognition. Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with less than three months maturity from the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are measured at cost.Loan Commitments Expected credit losses for irrevocable loan commitments are determined using the threestage impairment approach for financial assets measured at amortized cost and recognized as a liability.Financial liabilities except for derivative financial instruments Siemens measures financial liabilities at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts are measured at fair value unless they are designated as hedging instruments for which hedge accounting is applied. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized either in net income or in the case of a cash flow hedge in line item Other comprehensive income net of income taxes applicable deferred income tax. Certain derivative instruments embedded in host contracts are also accounted for separately as derivatives.Fair value hedges The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted by the gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk. Where an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as hedged item the subsequent cumulative change in its fair value is recognized as a separate financial asset or liability with corresponding gain or loss recognized in net income. For hedged items carried at amortized cost the adjustment is amortized until maturity of the hedged item. For hedged firm commitments the initial carrying amount of the assets or liabilities that result from meeting the firm commitments are adjusted to include the cumulative changes in the fair value that were previously recognized as separate financial assets or liabilities. Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recognized in line item Other comprehensive income net of income taxes and any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in net income. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified into net income in the same periods in which the hedged item affects net income.Sharebased payment Sharebased payment awards at Siemens are predominately designed as equitysettled. Fair value is measured at grant date and is expensed over the vesting period. Fair value is determined as the price of the underlying shares considering dividends during the vesting period the grantees are not entitled to as well as market conditions and nonvesting conditions if applicable. Plans granting the rights to receive subsidiary shares constitute own shares and accordingly are accounted as equitysettled.Insurance contracts In June the IASB issued IFRS Insurance contracts IFRS effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January . Siemens will adopt the standard commencing with fiscal . IFRS introduces and applies uniform accounting policies for insurance contracts and supersedes IFRS Insurance contracts. The adoption of IFRS is not expected to have a significant impact on Siemens Consolidated Financial Statements.Prioryear information The presentation of certain prioryear information has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. ,,,,,,,,,,,0.4468742782586527,,,,,,,,

215,Siemens Energy AG an associate accounted for using the equity method is globally active in the transmission and generation of electrical power and is publicly listed. The fair value of our investment in Siemens Energy AG is . billion and . billion respectively as of September and determined based on Siemens Energys market capitalization level of the fair value hierarchy. In fiscal and Siemens Energy AG added a loss to Share of profit loss net of million and million respectively. The loss includes Siemens share of Siemens Energy AGs net losses of million and million as well as effects from fair value adjustments at initial recognition of million and million respectively. In fiscal Siemens Energy AG acquired and redeemed shares of Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A. from the minority shareholders. The acquisition and redemption of shares of Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A. reduced equity within Siemens Energy AGs consolidated financial statements. Recognizing Siemens share in this equity transaction decreased the carrying amount of our investment in Siemens Energy AG by million which is recognized in Equity directly. In March Siemens Energy AG completed a capital increase in which Siemens did not participate. The transaction decreased Siemens stake in Siemens Energy AG from . to . which resulted in a gain of million disclosed in Income loss from investments accounted for using the equity method and in Reconciling items of Segment information. As of March the recoverable amount of our investment in Siemens Energy AG of . billion determined based on its market capitalization level of the fair value hierarchy increased significantly compared to the level when the impairment was recorded in fiscal .

403,Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. This risk arises whenever interest terms of financial assets and liabilities are different. In order to manage the Companys position with regard to interest rate risk interest income and interest expenses Corporate Treasury performs a comprehensive corporate interest rate risk management by using fixed or variable interest rates from bond issuances and derivative financial instruments when appropriate. The interest rate risk is mitigated by managing interest rate risk within an integrated Asset Liability Management approach and results primarily from funding in the U.S. dollar British pound and euro. This includes SFS business for which the interest rate risk was formerly managed separately.If there are no conflicting countryspecific regulations all Siemens operating units generally obtain any required financing through Corporate Treasury in the form of loans or intercompany clearing accounts. The same concept is adopted for deposits of cash generated by the units. As of September and the VaR relating to the interest rate was million and million. The decrease was driven mainly by a decrease in interest rate sensitivity for the U.S. dollar and a lower interest rate volatility for the euro. ,,,,,,,,,,,0.48570250080140676,,,,,,,,

Compliance Management System CMS in chapter . of the combined management report as well as the content of the Corporate Governance Statement which is published on the website stated in the combined management report. In our opinion on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply in all material respects with the International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Sec. e HGB Handelsgesetzbuch German Commercial Code as well as with full IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and in compliance with these requirements give a true and fair view of the assets liabilities and financial position of the Group as of September and of its financial performance for the fiscal year from October to September and the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Groups position.

Sentence HGB we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.,,,0.34797919804972893,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
667,Key audit matters are those matters that in our professional judgment were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year from October to September . These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Below we describe what we consider to be the key audit mattersRevenue recognition on constructiontype contractsReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter The Group conducts a significant portion of its business under constructiontype contracts particularly in the Mobility business. Revenue from longterm constructiontype contracts is recognized in accordance with IFRS Revenue from Contracts with Customers generally over time under the percentageofcompletion method. We consider the accounting for constructiontype contracts to be an area posing a significant risk of material misstatement including the potential risk of management override of internal controls and accordingly a key audit matter because managements assessments significantly impact the determination of the extent of progress towards completion. These assessments include in particular the scope of deliveries and services required to fulfill contractually defined obligations total estimated contract costs remaining costs to completion and total estimated contract revenues as well as contract risks including technical political regulatory legal and supply chain risks. ,,,,,,0.5165131784973359,,0.3990345531139746,,,,,,,,,,,
668,Revenues total estimated contract costs and profit recognition may deviate significantly from original estimates based on new knowledge about cost overruns and changes in project scope over the term of a constructiontype contract. The effects of current geopolitical and macroeconomic developments on the project business such as delays in project execution price increases or disruptions in supply chains and their accounting treatment were taken into account during our audit.Auditors response As part of our audit we obtained an understanding of the Groups internally established methods processes and control mechanisms for project management in the bid and execution phase of constructiontype contracts. In this regard we assessed the design and operating effectiveness of the accountingrelated internal controls in the project business by obtaining an understanding of business transactions specific to constructiontype contracts from the initiation of the transaction through presentation in the consolidated financial statements. We also tested controls addressing the timely assessment of changes in cost estimates the timely and complete recognition of such changes in the project calculation as well as their accounting treatment. As part of our substantive audit procedures which particularly involved project reviews we evaluated managements estimates and assumptions based on a riskbased selection of a sample of contracts. Our sample primarily included projects that are subject to significant future uncertainties and risks such as projects with complex safetytechnical and regulatory requirements or projects with a large portion of materials and services to be provided by suppliers or consortium partners fixedprice or turnkey projects crossborder projects and projects with changes in cost estimates delays andor low or negative margins. Our audit procedures included among others review of the contracts and their terms and conditions including contractually agreed partial deliveries and services termination rights penalties for delay and breach of contract liquidated damages as well as joint and several liability. In order to evaluate whether revenues were recognized on an accrual basis for the selected projects we analyzed revenues attributable to the fiscal year and corresponding cost of sales to be recognized in the statement of income considering the extent of progress towards completion and examined the accounting for the associated items in the statement of financial position. For this we also assessed the accounting for contractually agreed options contract amendments or contract terminations including related pending legal proceedings also in relation to previous constructiontype contracts with Russian customers. We also assessed the recognition requirements of reimbursement claims.We further performed inquiries of project management both commercial and technical project managers with respect to the development of the projects the reasons for deviations between planned and actual costs the current estimated costs to complete the projects and managements assessments on probabilities that contract risks and claims from joint and several liability will materialize. To identify anomalies in the development of margins and other project KPIs we also applied data analysis procedures. In designing our audit procedures we also considered results from project audits conducted by the internal audit function. Furthermore we obtained evidence from third parties for selected projects e.g. project acceptance documentation contractual terms and conditions and lawyers confirmations regarding alleged breaches of contract and asserted claims and inspected the status of projects at plant sites. Due to the large contract volume and risk profile our audit procedures focused on large contracts for delivery of highspeed and commuter trains.Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to revenue recognition on constructiontype contracts. Reference to related disclosures With regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for constructiontype contracts refer to Note Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. With respect to contract assets and liabilities as well as provisions for order related losses and risks refer to Note Contract assets and liabilities Note Provisions and Note Commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.Valuation of the investment in Siemens Energy AGReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter Since the spinoff of Siemens Energy AG in September Siemens AG has held a . stake in the listed Siemens Energy AG which was reduced to . due to capital measures at Siemens Energy AG and the contribution of shares in Siemens Energy AG to the Siemens PensionTrust e.V. in fiscal year . The investment is accounted for as an associate applying the equity method in accordance with IAS Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. As of June an impairment was recognized on the investment. During the first six months of the financial year the market capitalization of the investment was mostly higher than the value at the time of the impairment. As of March the latter was significantly exceeded. As a result an impairment reversal was made in accordance with IAS Impairment of Assets in the amount of the increase in the stock market price since the date of the impairment until March . In addition Siemens Energy AG acquired additional shares in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A. in fiscal year . This led to a reduction in equity in the consolidated financial statements of Siemens Energy AG. The recognition of Siemens share in this equity transaction resulted in a reduction of the carrying amount of the investment in Siemens Energy AG which was recognized directly in Siemens equity. As of September the pro rata market value of the investment was above the book value.Due to the judgments and estimates by management in the analyses and assessments with regards to possible impairments or reversals of impairments as well as the overall material implications for the assets liabilities and financial position of the Group and the related significant risk of material misstatement the assessment of the investment in Siemens Energy AG is one of the key audit matters.Auditors response As part of our audit procedures in relation to managements assessment regarding the valuation of the investment in Siemens Energy AG we examined the methods and processes defined internally for the identification of indicators for a reversal of an impairment and thus the timing of a possible reversal of an impairment as well as the measurement of a reversal of an impairment of the investment in Siemens Energy AG.With regards to the assessment of whether there are indications for a reversal of an impairment in particular regarding the interpretation of a possible significant increase of the fair value we evaluated managements assessment made on a quarterly and yearend basis as well as managements judgements and estimates contained therein and also considered external evidence on credit ratings stock market prices analysts assessments and observable valuation indicatorsin this regard. In addition we evaluated the calculation of the reversal of the impairment as of March .,,,,,,0.5123807978430603,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Credit lines included in the guarantee obligations in the context of financing affiliated companies are recognized at their nominal amount.Derivative financial instruments are used by Siemens AG almost exclusively for hedging purposes and if the relevant conditions are met are aggregated with the underlying hedged item into valuation units. When a valuation unit is created changes in values or cash flows from the hedged item and hedging contract are compared.

1152,B.... BASIC PRINCIPLES AND FUNCTIONING Siemens grants longterm variable compensation in the form of Stock Awards. A Stock Award is the claim to one share conditional on target achievement after the expiration of a defined vesting period. The vesting period is accordingly the term of each Stock Awards tranche. At the beginning of a fiscal year the Supervisory Board defines a target amount in euros based on target achievement for each Managing Board member. This target amount is extrapolated to target achievement of maximum allocation amount. Stock Awards for this maximum allocation amount are then allocated to the Managing Board members. The number of Stock Awards is calculated by dividing the maximum allocation amount by the price of the Siemens share on the allocation date less the estimated discounted dividends allocation price. An approximately fouryear vesting period begins with the allocation of Stock Awards after the expiration of which Siemens shares are transferred. The beneficiary Managing Board members are not entitled to dividends during the vesting period. Performance criteria Since fiscal the number of Siemens shares that is actually transferred depends on the financial performance criterion longterm value creation measured on the basis of the key performance indicator total shareholder return TSR and on the nonfinancial performance criterion sustainability. For measuring the sustainability performance criterion Siemens AGs performance in the environment social and governance ESG area is assessed on the basis of a Siemensinternal ESGSustainability index the composition of which is determined annually by the Supervisory Board. Total shareholder return TSR is indicative of the performance of one share over a specified period of time in the case of Siemens over the approximately fouryear vesting period. It takes into account changes in the share price and the dividends paid during this period. To reflect the Companys international footprint the TSR of Siemens AG is compared at the end of the vesting period with the TSR of an international sector index the MSCI World Industrials or a comparable successor index. Target achievement for TSR is concretely determined by first calculating a TSR reference value for Siemens AG and a TSR reference value for the sector index. The TSR reference value is equal to the average of the endofmonth values over the first months of the vesting period reference period. In order to determine at the end of the vesting period how well the TSR of Siemens AG has performed relative to the TSR of the sector index the TSR performance value is calculated over the subsequent months performance period. The TSR performance value is the average of the endofmonth values during the performance period. ,,,,0.35431092470805087,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
