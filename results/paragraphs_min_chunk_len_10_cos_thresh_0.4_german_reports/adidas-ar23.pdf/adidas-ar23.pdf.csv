86,They all play a little bit of a different role but what they have in common is that after years of covid and difficult circumstances for big events with no spectators or limited access its the first year again where everything is largely back to normal. I think both athletes and spectators are looking forward to participating in big events and to celebrating sports and being together again. The summer of sport starts with the UEFA EURO in our home market Germany which of course is very special. We all remember the fantastic atmosphere of the football World Cup in Germany and I think we will see the same again this year. It will be a very important event not only for sports but for peoples mindset in general. For us both the EURO and the Copa also have a business impact because we sell replicas of the different teams licensed products and the official match ball for the EURO Fussballliebe. The Olympics and Paralympics are different because they are not necessarily commercial events where we sell a lot of products directly related to them. But the Olympics and Paralympics both create global and local heroes. And they make sport play a bigger role in peoples life all over the world. Thats why in general they have a positive impact on sports companies and especially adidas which is the Olympic brand when you look back at our history. It is really good for us that these sports events all happen in because that fits perfectly with our plan to be the best sports brand again. It is also perfect timing with the product pipeline and the plans we have for and beyond. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.28508645565489926,

214,In order to perform our tasks in an efficient manner we have established a total of five standing Supervisory Board committees. The committees prepare resolutions and topics for the meetings of the entire Supervisory Board. Within the legally permissible framework and in appropriate cases we have furthermore delegated the Supervisory Boards authority to pass certain resolutions to individual committees. With the exception of the Audit Committee the Chairman of the Supervisory Board also chairs all the standing committees. The respective committee chairmen report to the Supervisory Board on their work as well as the content and results of the committee meetings on a regular and comprehensive basis. The Steering Committee did not meet in the year under review. The General Committee held six meetings in the year under review six meetings. The main task of the General Committee was to prepare resolutions for the entire Supervisory Board on personnel and compensation matters of the Executive Board. In particular it discussed the extension of Harm Ohlmeyers appointment and the terminations of Roland Auschels Brian Grevys and Amanda Rajkumars appointments by mutual consent. The General Committee also prepared Arthur Hoelds and Michelle Robertsons appointments. Regarding Executive Board compensation the General Committee mainly drafted proposals for resolutions on the targets the target achievement and the amount of the variable performancerelated compensation and preexamined the horizontal and vertical appropriateness of the Executive Board compensation. Furthermore the General Committee dealt intensively with the Compensation Report for the year under review and the revision of the compensation system for the Executive Board. The longterm succession planning for the Executive Board was also discussed by the General Committee. The Audit Committee held four meetings in the year under review four meetings. The Chief Financial Officer and the auditor were present at all meetings and reported to the committee members in detail. The Audit Committee followed the recommendation of the Code and regularly consulted with the auditor at Audit Committee meetings without the Executive Board being present. In addition to the monitoring of the accounting process the committees work focused on the audit of the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements including the combined Management Report and the nonfinancial statement of adidas AG and the Group as well as the proposal regarding the appropriation of retained earnings. Following a detailed presentation of the audit reports by the auditor the Audit Committee decided to recommend to the Supervisory Board to approve the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements. Furthermore the Audit Committee prepared the audit of the nonfinancial statement. In the year under review the Audit Committee thoroughly discussed the continued development and monitoring of the effectiveness and adequacy of the Risk Management System the Internal Audit System the Internal Control System and the Compliance Management System. Moreover due to the initial appointment of PwC as auditor by the Annual General Meeting the Audit Committee also dealt intensively with the progress of PwCs onboarding and the preparation of the audit. Other matters discussed in detail were the assignment of the audit mandate to the auditor and the determination of the audit fees and key audit matters. In accordance with section sentence AktG the Audit Committee furthermore commissioned the auditor with the audit of the content of the nonfinancial statement with limited assurance and with an audit with reasonable assurance of the statements on the share of sustainable ,,0.3344357838194142,,,,0.3257947769364596,,,,0.31380565916608916,,,,,0.34574263500442703,0.3119147921278323,,,

254,as well as compliance with and observance of legal provisions and internal regulations by the Group companies. For this purpose the Executive Board sets up an Internal Control and Risk Management System adequate and effective in view of the scope of business activities and the companys risk situation which comprises a Compliance Management System aligned to the companys risk situation and also covers sustainabilityrelated objectives. The Executive Board also provides employees with the opportunity to report in an appropriate and protected manner suspected legal infringements within the company. The Executive Board is tied to the companys interests and obligated to strive for a sustainable increase in the value of the company. Notwithstanding the Executive Boards joint responsibility for managing the company the Executive Board members are individually responsible for managing their respective operations in accordance with the Business Allocation Plan for the Executive Board. There are no Executive Board committees. The Chief Executive Officer represents the Executive Board and the company and is in charge of the overall management and development of the company including cooperation with the Supervisory Board as well as coordination and supervision of the Executive Board members work the Executive Board areas operations brands and markets. The Executive Board members continually report to the Chief Executive Officer and to each other about all significant developments in their respective business areas and coordinate with each other on all crossfunctional measures. Collaboration within the Executive Board is further governed by the Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board and the Business Allocation Plan. These documents specifically stipulate requirements for meetings and resolutions as well as for cooperation with the Supervisory Board. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board cooperate closely and trustfully for the benefit of the company. The Executive Board reports to the Supervisory Board regularly extensively and in a timely manner on all matters relevant to the companys strategy planning business development financial position and compliance as well as on material business risks. Fundamental questions related to the corporate strategy and its implementation are thoroughly discussed and aligned with the Supervisory Board. The composition of the Executive Board is determined by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board is committed to promoting a culture of diversity and inclusion at adidas. Diversity is understood in the broadest sense including age gender cultural origin nationality educational background professional qualifications and experience. Greater diversity on the Executive Board will help secure the longterm success of adidas by taking diverse perspectives into account. For this reason the Supervisory Board has adopted a diversity concept. In addition an age limit of years applies for Executive Board members. The General Committee of the Supervisory Board already takes the diversity concept into account when selecting candidates for Executive Board positions. Every decision by the Supervisory Board on the composition of the Executive Board is made in the best interests of the company and with due consideration of all circumstances in each individual case. In the opinion of the Supervisory Board the current composition of the Executive Board meets the diversity concept mentioned above. As at the balance sheet date no member of the Executive Board has accepted a Supervisory Board chair or more than two Supervisory Board mandates in nongroup listed companies or in supervisory bodies of nongroup companies with comparable requirements. ,,0.3395453899597329,,0.3300486902199946,,,0.42117612590834963,,,0.3468305324969672,,,,,0.32540477418450975,0.2640163444176566,,,

Our GHG reduction target for value chain emissions Scope of by baseline meets the SBTis criteria for ambitious value chain goals meaning they are in line with current best practices.When it comes to decarbonization we believe that data quality is critical. Therefore in addition to developing a tool that enables us to quantify monitor and be transparent about our carbon footprint along our entire value chain we have put considerable effort in gathering more primary data from our suppliers over the last few years. This has allowed us to gain more precise insights into carbon emissions energy consumption and the impact of our decarbonization initiatives. As both the quality and availability of data improved significantly in we were able to update our methodology for measuring carbon footprint across our value chain. Consequently we recalculated the data to ensure yearoveryear comparability. This updated methodology continues to be fully aligned with international methodology standards provided by e.g. the GHG Protocol and SBTi and reduces the dependance on assumptions and generalizations typically presented by secondary data. As in the previous year the results show that our environmental impacts are distributed unequally across the value chain with the most significant impacts generated in the supply chain particularly in raw materials production and processing. The following table shows the total annual GHG emissions across our value chain. The average Scope and annual GHG emissions per product for decreased by compared to the previous year. This reduction has been driven by the work done with our suppliers such as continuing with the phaseout of coal in our manufacturing facilities and the increased use of renewable energy. Our innovation effort that has also enabled us to use lowcarbon manufacturing methods and materials as well as decreased production volumes due to high inventory levels in the market translated into a reduction in total absolute GHG emissions,,,0.3596314184488978,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While we continue our transition toward renewable electricity in Europe in the past few years we decided to switch our focus from shortterm initiatives such as the purchasing of EACs for Europe and North America to more impactful measures e.g. securing longterm renewable electricity contracts such as PPAs. As a result we saw no significant change in reported Scope and GHG emissions despite an overall decrease in energy consumption compared to . In we signed a virtual PPA for Europe For a period of ten years adidas will be supplied with approximately MWh of renewable electricity per year produced by a new solar project in Spain starting in . This will contribute to the longterm reduction of emissions from our European operations. Our IMS helps us to secure all relevant ISO management systems certifications for key locations such as environmental management ISO health and safety management ISO and energy management ISO .

736,We make continuous efforts toward optimizing waste diversion across our supply chain with the aim of increasing the value of waste within the life cycle e.g. through recycling or reuse. We have developed waste management guidelines to help our suppliers improve waste segregation in manufacturing prioritizing recycling and reuse of nonhazardous waste. These guidelines specify that the nonrecyclable waste materials should not be directly landfilled. We developed a waste diversion program to use nonrecyclable manufacturing waste in energy production in collaboration with coprocessing partners in our major sourcing countries. Coprocessing is a proven and sustainable solution that can reduce pollution reduce consumption of natural resources reduce landfill space and ultimately contribute to a smaller carbon footprint. To further optimize waste diversion we have scaled up this solution across the globe especially in sourcing countries with immature coprocessing infrastructure. Globally the suppliers enrolled in our environmental program collectively achieved a landfill diversion in .At own operations during we continued to focus on improving the quality of wasterelated data from our administrative offices and distribution centers by upskilling team members on the data collection process of waste streams. This resulted in a higher data quality but also a lower diversion rate. As of of our own operations by square meters are monitoring and tracking waste. By the end of a total of tons tons of waste was generated and we achieved an accumulated diversion rate of for administrative offices and distribution centers.,,0.36215097430241106,0.4802667677417758,,0.5477354340305416,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We define articles as sustainable when they show environmental benefits versus conventional articles due to the materials used meaning that they are to a significant degree made with environmentally preferred materials. The majority of the environmentally preferred materials currently used are recycled materials or more sustainable cotton. To qualify as a sustainable article environmentally preferred materials have to exceed a certain predefined percentage of the article weight. The applied criteria for environmentally preferred materials and the percentage of the article weight are defined based on standards reflecting the latest industry developments competitor benchmarks and expert opinions For apparel the environmentally preferred material content is required to be at least of the article weight for accessories and gear at least and for footwear at least .,,,0.3744823521661897,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

762,In we continued to assess and better understand where exactly our impacts lie and started to formulate our approach to managing biodiversity challenges in our value chain. Particular focus was given to the potential risk of deforestation because it represents the greatest lever for reducing the loss of biodiversity. In our value chain a potential risk of deforestation is linked to the sourcing of naturederived commodities used in our products and packaging such as leather natural rubber and timber. Following scientifically validated frameworks from the Science Based Targets Network SBTN and the Accountability Framework we identified first concrete actions to be taken across our entire value chain such as mapping our supply chain beyond our Tier suppliers and setting timebound commitments for deforestationfree supply chains. In we prioritized leather and have already set a target. Roadmaps for natural rubber and timberderived materials are under development. ,0.3681561680184556,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
765,Timberrelated commodities and alternatives In alignment with our DCF commitment we have worked with Canopy Planet to structure our commitments on timberrelated materials. This includes supporting the conservation of forests and ecosystems further assessing our sourcing of manmade cellulosic fibers and paper packaging and working toward eliminating sourcing from ancient and endangered forests. We continue to prioritize recycled or DCFcertified paper packaging. Through the Fashion for Good innovator platform we are collaborating with various innovators to explore alternatives to virgin materials such as from agricultural waste. Our involvement in such innovation pilots supports the fashion industry in finding solutions to avoid increasing pressure on forestderived materials. ,0.2997402697283595,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
766,Animalderived materials We follow standards for sourcing animalderived materials in an ethical and sustainable manner that respects animal welfare and species conservation. We do not source or process raw materials from endangered or threatened species as defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN in its Red List. All down used in our products is either virgin down certified by the Textile Exchanges Responsible Down Standard RDS or recycled down. Regarding the sourcing of wool we are committed to increase the share of wool that is certified by Textile Exchanges Responsible Wool Standard RWS to by the end of . In we also assessed potential biodiversity risks connected to other commodities in our supply chain and our own as well as our strategic suppliers operations for potential impacts on protected areas key biodiversity areas and the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In we continued our work on biodiversity at our headquarters in Germany and completed a campuswide inventory created a master plan and implemented initial measures to improve biodiversity on campus. Results will be used to develop new plans to reflect observations and implement sciencebased biodiversity actions. We also raised employee awareness of biodiversity regenerative agriculture and deforestation and conversion through several internal upskilling sessions collaborative workshops and employee activations around the globe. ,0.4260294849695456,,0.37125201382631373,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
770,Product safety is an imperative. As a company we have to manage the risk of selling defective products that may result in injury to consumers. To mitigate this risk we have companywide product safety policies in place that ensure we consistently apply physical and chemical product safety and conformity standards. The creation of respective adidas standards and policies is a collaborative crossfunctional approach involving experts from both our Legal and Global Operations departments to ensure all aspects of a specific product are covered. This includes subsequent updates and training activities. Application and monitoring of compliance with our policies are ensured through Global Operations. One of these policies is the Restricted Substances Policy A Policy we pioneered in . It covers the strictest applicable local requirements and includes best practice standards as recommended by consumer organizations. The policy is updated and published internally and externally at least once a year based on findings in our ongoing dialogue with scientific organizations and is mandatory for all business partners. Both our own quality laboratories and external institutes are used to constantly monitor material samples for compliance with our requirements. Materials that do not meet our standards and specifications are rejected. As a result of our ongoing efforts we did not record any product recalls in . ,,,0.3723601931478135,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
771,Over the past few years we have substantially contributed to the Restricted Substances List of Apparel and Footwear International RSL Management AFIRM which constitutes a harmonized restricted substances list across the industry. While the uptake of the list as an industry best practice matured further and AFIRM membership continues to grow various tools have been developed further in such as a harmonized test request form the thirdparty lab evaluation questionnaire and the offer of additional languages for the supplier online training videos. In addition a PFAS phaseout guidance supported by an online webinar for suppliers has been published. All these tools will be issued to the public and made available to other companies from the textile and sporting goods industry and their suppliers. We also continued to participate in several major public stakeholder consultation processes initiated by the European Commission e.g. European Chemicals Agency and US state legislative initiatives to inform governmental entities on implications and opportunities of drafted legislation. To respond to the increasing legislation from US states such as the recently enacted Federal US Environmental Protection Agency EPA law for PFAS we have strengthened our status sharing for US retailers and our outreach to strategic suppliers also enhancing our tracking functionality retroactively. ,,,0.39151700042033005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

781,Our commitment to ensuring fair labor practices and safe working conditions in our manufacturing facilities throughout our global supply chain is fundamental to our human rights approach. Our active efforts are guided by the adidas Workplace Standards which is our supply chain code of conduct that is aligned with the Fair Labor Association FLA Workplace Code of Conduct and Principles of Fair Labor and Responsible Sourcing. These standards are embedded as a contractual obligation in the manufacturing agreements to ensure workers are employed in fair safe and healthy workplaces that are environmentally sound. In addition they follow ILO and UN conventions relating to human rights and to fundamental principles and rights at work as well as the model code of conduct of the World Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry WFSGI. We seek to extend our reach by cascading responsibilities to our contractual partners to capture and address potential and actual risks related to possible labor rights violations upstream and downstream of our supply chain. Specific reference to the code provisions of the ILO core labor conventions is provided in the adidas Guidelines on Employment Standards. The Social and Environmental Affairs SEA senior management team reviews and approves all policies and implementation processes of the labor rights program. In addition to regular compliance monitoring in we continued to focus on our own purchasing practices in accordance with our Responsible Sourcing and Purchasing Policy to ensure that our sourcing activities do not negatively impact our manufacturing partners ability to comply with our social and environmental standards. To best understand potential impacts we have sought feedback from our manufacturing partners both anonymously and openly through our subscription to the Better Buying Institute an independent organization that assesses and reports on the sourcing practices of participating brands and through our own engagement with our suppliers. Based on this feedback we have continued our efforts to improve our purchasing practices. In addition in partnership with Better Buying we expanded the use of our elearning training on responsible purchasing practices to more than employees in Global Operations. In the training was also shared with the majority of adidas licensee partners to further improve their understanding of effective responsible purchasing policies. ,,,0.36806798346377906,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

877,The Taxonomy is a classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities. An economic activity is considered Taxonomyeligible if it is described in one of the delegated acts of the Taxonomy and has the potential to support the achievement of at least one of the following six environmental objectives Climate change mitigation Climate change adaptation Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources Transition to a circular economy Pollution prevention and control Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.

Reporting scope for fiscal year TheDelegated Regulation Delegated Regulation EU on Article of the Taxonomy specifies the content methodology and presentation of information to be disclosed by financial and nonfinancial undertakings concerning the proportion of environmentally sustainable economic activities in their business investments or lending activities. With the introduction of Delegated Regulation EU in and its amendment in Delegated Regulation EU the EU clarified the conditions under which an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to climate change mitigation andor climate change adaptation and for determining whether that economic activity does not cause any significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives. Furthermore in the EU enacted the Delegated Regulation EU establishing the Taxonomy eligibility and alignment criteria of economic activities for the remaining four environmental objectives mentioned above. However for the first year of application for adidas the reporting on the financial year only the proportion of Taxonomyeligible and noneligible activities in their total turnover net sales capital expenditure CapEx and operating expenditure OpEx KPIs need to be disclosed for the remaining four environmental objectives. For the environmental objectives of climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation as in the prior year it is necessary to provide information on the degree to which Taxonomyeligible economic activities are Taxonomyaligned and to disclose the corresponding financial KPIs. Despite the expansion of the Taxonomy disclosure requirements in the adidas core business activities i.e. the manufacturing of textiles and footwear as well as wholesale and retail sale thereof remain unmentioned in the delegated acts and therefore noneligible for any of the six environmental objectives. In addition as per Delegated Regulation EU we are required to provide specific disclosures on economic activities related to the fossil gas and nuclear energy sectors. We carried out related activities in due to the operation of a district heating plant in Germany although similar to not to a material extent. Thus the detailed disclosure requirements as per Annex XII of the Delegated Regulation do not apply to adidas. ,0.2873402801999114,,0.3972312313713366,,0.362467765092818,,0.4305785208064335,,,,,,,,,,,,

891,For Taxonomyeligible activities at adidas the environmental objective of climate change mitigation is applicable not climate change adaptation since these activities are intended to positively impact our carbon footprint. Hence the Taxonomyeligible activities have been assessed according to the substantial contribution and DNSH criteria as laid out in Annex I to the Delegated Regulation EU . Since the identified Taxonomyeligible activities relate to the purchase of output from potentially Taxonomyaligned activities performing the Taxonomy assessment was dependent on the input of the relevant information from the respective thirdparty suppliers. Due to the expected time and resource investment necessary for assessing all individual projects and items contributing to the eligible activities we prioritized the assessment of those individual activities that were most material in terms of value andor were more likely to be Taxonomyaligned due to the availability of the necessary information. Eligible building leases relate to warehousesdistribution centers own retail stores and corporate offices. The applicable substantial contribution and DNSH criteria as set out in section . of Annex I of the Delegated Regulation predominantly relate to primary energy demand and climaterelated risks and adaptation solutions respectively in connection with the leased buildings. The substantial contribution criterion evidence which is most relevant for adidas in this regard is the existence of an Energy Performance Certificate EPC class A. Many of the eligible building leases are located outside of the EU where this EUcentric energy performance certification is not common practice and other standards and frameworks which are not mentioned in the Regulation are typically used e.g. LEED certification. In line with the generally low share of available nonresidential buildings meeting these energy performance standards across our markets only a few eligible leases in fulfill this criterion in particular the eligible retail leases for which adidas has very limited ability to influence the design andor ,,,0.39906145435456447,0.3682542448958135,,0.33362078851205695,0.41310379732498287,,,,,,,,,,,,
892,redevelopment especially for mallbased stores which is the case for many of our retail locations. In addition certain eligible retail lease locations are heritage sites for which it is not possible to obtain EPC class A certification. However we have certain eligible lease contracts in connection with smaller warehouse Dubai retail Poland and corporate office locations Sweden and the Netherlands that fulfill the substantial contribution criterion. This reflects our commitment to decarbonize our own operations as well as our more pronounced ability to influence the design and development of major real estate investments related to our operational infrastructure. ,,,,0.32588733233544975,,0.36217324458776456,0.4374365366942882,,,,,0.37158218389375836,,,,,,,0.3725412250156178
894,The relevant applicable DNSH criterion for building leases relates to the environmental objective of climate change adaptation and refers to the performance of a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment as per Appendix A to Annex I of the Delegated Regulation. In the assessment we prioritized the most relevant eligible activities for this DNSH criterion. Thereby on a casebycase basis we approached the landlords requesting the necessary information on the one hand and on the other used existing information on climate risks and corresponding adaptation solutions that is regularly gathered as part of our standard business processes e.g. for insurance purposes. As a result for the majority of the assessed building leases not all information was available for a complete and conclusive assessment exactly as per the methodology and scope prescribed by the Regulation. However one of the eligible building leases that fulfills the substantial contribution criterion also complies with the DNSH criterion and is therefore reported as Taxonomyaligned.Eligible company car leases relate to the car fleet at multiple adidas locations. As per the applicable technical screening criteria mentioned in section . of Annex I a vehicle that emits a maximum of g of CO,,,,0.3442994132733761,,0.3593466403415352,,,,,,0.31586531143825647,,,,,,,
895,ekm is considered to make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. For adidas this applies to all leased electric vehicles and most plugin hybrid vehicles. Compliance with the DNSH criteria as laid out in Annex I of the Delegated Regulation requires the performance of a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment adherence of the vehicles to certain recyclability and reusability criteria and adherence to various productrelated EU regulations and directives concerning the limits of certain gaseous emissions and the external rolling noise and resistance characteristics of the vehicle tires. Assessing compliance with all these criteria requires the involvement and input of various suppliers. As a result not all information was available for a complete and conclusive assessment as required by the Regulation. We therefore assessed the eligible car leases as not Taxonomyaligned.For the remaining eligible activities under section . an assessment of the Taxonomy alignment against the respective criteria laid out in Annex I of the Delegated Regulation was conducted in a structured manner as far as this was possible with reasonable effort. While the eligible activities fulfill the substantial contribution criterion none of them are considered to be Taxonomyaligned as a result of the noncompliance with the DNSH assessment.,,,0.36612008442109095,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In total the corresponding numerator of the eligible CapEx KPI amounts to million million resulting in a CapEx KPI of eligible and noneligible CapEx. Most of the eligible CapEx in relates to building leases section . which amount to million with million eligible CapEx relating to the installation of energy efficiency equipment section . and the remaining million eligible CapEx relating to car leases section .. While a total of million of eligible CapEx complies with the substantial contribution criteria million of eligible CapEx are Taxonomyaligned.

1359,Risks related to tax and customs regulations ,,,,,,,0.43316254536270127,,,,,,,,,,,,
1360,Numerous laws and regulations regarding customs and taxes as well as changes in such laws and regulations affect the companys business practices worldwide. Noncompliance with regulations concerning product imports including calculation of customs values intercompany transactions or income taxes could lead to substantial financial penalties and additional costs as well as negative media coverage and therefore reputational damage for example in case of understatements or underpayments of corporate income taxes or customs duties. Changes in regulations regarding customs and taxes may also have a substantial impact on the companys sourcing costs or income taxes. Therefore we also create provisions in accordance with the relevant accounting regulations to account for potential disputes with customs or tax authorities. Due to the current geopolitical situation we assume in individual cases increasingly aggressive positions taken by tax and customs authorities in audits which could increase the potential impact of such risks and the likelihood that they materialize. In the OECDG Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting agreed on a twopillar solution to address the tax ,,,,,,,0.45273256638464043,,,,,,,,,,,,
1361,challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy. Pillar which includes the introduction of global minimum tax could lead to higherthanplanned income tax expenses from onwards. We seek to manage tax and customs risks in a balanced way that bears an appropriate relationship to the operating structure commercial and economic substance and other business risks. To proactively manage such risks we constantly seek expert advice from specialized independent law and tax advisory firms in areas such as process design transaction advisory compliance and tax or customs audits. Processes are in place requiring that attention is regularly directed to potential areas of tax or customs risk e.g. a quarterly tax risk questionnaire and the corporate tax and customs teams are involved in critical business transactions. Compliance with global tax and customs policies and controls is monitored by the Corporate Tax and Customs teams internal controls experts and the Internal Audit department. We closely monitor changes in legislation to properly adopt regulatory requirements regarding customs and taxes apply any available and applicable guidance from tax authorities and organizations such as the OECD the World Customs Organization and the World Trade Organization and seek guidance from individual authorities as appropriate which may include requesting tax rulings from a tax authority. In addition our internal legal customs and tax teams advise our operational management teams to ensure appropriate and compliant business practices. Our specialized staff receive adequate training for their role and nontax or noncustoms staff are made aware of potential tax and customs matters relevant to their roles. Furthermore we work closely with customs authorities and governments worldwide to make sure we adhere to customs and trade regulations at import and export to ensure the availability and obtain the required clearance of products to fulfill sales demand. ,,,,,,,0.49586646575407994,0.36154442122982905,,0.3541362812795375,,,0.3868537176610739,0.3981825339113617,0.33457561793054985,,,,

Organizational transformations and reorganizations are supported by change activations with our leadership teams and organizational design consultancy. We continuously invest in improving employer branding activities and our global recruiting organization constantly enhances our internal and external recruiting services and capabilities. Our global succession management helps create internal talent pipelines for critical leadership positions and therefore reduces succession risk. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.34549249087239,,,,,,
1368,Theft leakage corruption or unavailability of critical information e.g. consumer data employee data product data and systems could lead to reputational damage regulatory penalties or the inability to perform key business processes. Key business processes including product marketing order management warehouse management invoice processing customer support and financial reporting are all dependent on IT systems. Significant outages application failures or cybersecurity threats to our infrastructure or that of our business partners could therefore result in reputational damage regulatory penalties or cause considerable business disruption or impact to businesscritical data. To mitigate these risks our Information Security organization proactively drives system preventive maintenance service continuity planning adherence to Information Security policies aligned with the NIST framework and continuous execution of a comprehensive information security program aligned with a zerotrust strategy. Information security architecture design application security governance data security employee awareness programs and a x incident response help us to adequately protect the company. We have also secured limited insurance coverage for damage resulting from cybersecurity incidents. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3513618727589779,,,,,,

1382,To effectively support further business growth and improve efficiency adidas continuously invests in new projects such as the creation implementation expansion harmonization or modernization of IT systems distribution centers or office buildings. Ineffective project management could delay the execution of critical projects and lead to higher expenditures. Inadequate project planning and controlling as well as executional mistakes or ineffective change management could cause inefficiencies delays or business disruption resulting in higher costs and sales shortfalls. Inappropriate project governance prioritization and oversight of the project portfolio may lead to suboptimal resource allocation and undesired project results. We manage projects utilizing reviews by project teams as well as project steering committees to evaluate the progress quality and costs of those projects on a regular basis. This approach allows early detection of project risks and quick implementation of corrective action or timely cancelation of projects with a low chance of success. To ensure true endtoend management of key projects we have established a network of program and project management departments across all main functions i.e. Sales Marketing Operations Finance IT and Human Resources.

1476,Amendments to IAS Definition of Accounting Estimates effective date January In February the IASB issued amendments to IAS in which it introduces a definition of accounting estimates. The amendments clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. Also they clarify how entities use measurement techniques and inputs to develop accounting estimates. The amendments apply to changes in accounting policies and changes in accounting estimates that occur on or after the start of the effective date.

1477,Amendments to IAS and IFRS Practice Statement Disclosure of Accounting Policies effective date January In February the IASB issued amendments to IAS and IFRS Practice Statement Making Materiality Judgements in which it provides guidance and examples to help entities apply materiality judgments to accounting policy disclosures. The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are more useful by replacing the requirement for entities to disclose their significant accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their material accounting policies and adding guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures. The amendments to IAS are applicable for annual periods beginning on or after January . Since the amendments to the Practice Statement provide nonmandatory guidance on the application of the definition of material to accounting policy information an effective date for these amendments is not necessary. The amendments have led to a selective reduction in the disclosures on accounting policies.,,,,,,,,,,0.30510315580466874,,,,,,0.2884112842745949,,,

The amendments to IFRS are applicable for annual periods beginning on or after January and must be applied retrospectively to sale and leaseback transactions entered into after the date of initial application of IFRS .

1482,Amendments to IAS Classification of Liabilities as Current or Noncurrent effective date January In January the IASB issued amendments to paragraphs to of IAS to specify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or noncurrent. The amendments clarify what is meant by a right to defer settlement that such a right to defer must exist at the end of the reporting period and that the classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral right. In October the IASB issued further amendments to IAS in which it clarifies that only covenants with which an entity must comply on or before the reporting date will affect a liabilitys classification as current or noncurrent. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January and must be applied retrospectively.

All purchases and sales of financial assets with the exception of trade receivables are recognized on the trade date and initially measured at fair value. At initial recognition trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component are measured at their transaction price. Subsequently a financial asset is measured at amortized cost fair value through other comprehensive income debt instrument fair value through other comprehensive income equity instrument or fair value through profit or loss.

1517,Cash and cash equivalents represent cash at banks cash on hand and shortterm deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition such as commercial papers and investments in money market funds. Cash equivalents are shortterm highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash equivalents can partly include investments in money market funds. Classification and measurement under IFRS are performed based on the companys business model for managing these financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics. Investments in money market funds contain cash flows other than those of principal and interest on principal. As a result those investments are measured at fair value through profit or loss. ,,,,,,,,,,,0.4806006132929796,,,,,,,,

1540,If facts and circumstances indicate that noncurrent assets e.g. property plant and equipment as well as intangible assets including goodwill and contract assets might be impaired the recoverable amount is determined. This is measured at the higher of fair value less costs of disposal net disposal price and value in use. Recoverable amount is determined on an individual asset level unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. If this is the case recoverable amount is determined for the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs. The fair value is measured at Level according to IFRS Fair Value Measurement. An impairment loss is recognized in other operating expenses or reported in goodwill impairment losses if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The impairment test for goodwill is performed based on groups of cashgenerating units which represent the lowest level within the company at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. If there is an impairment loss for a group of cashgenerating units then first the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the group of cashgenerating units is reduced. Subsequently provided that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount the other noncurrent assets of the group of cashgenerating units are reduced pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the group of cashgenerating units. In allocating an impairment loss the carrying amount of an individual asset is not reduced below its fair value. The amount of the impairment loss that would otherwise have been allocated to the asset is allocated pro rata to the other assets of the cashgenerating unit and groups of cashgenerating units. Irrespective of whether there is an impairment indication intangible assets with an indefinite useful life intangible assets not yet available for use and goodwill acquired in business combinations are tested annually on December for impairment. In the case that indicators for impairment are present at any point in time other than on December these assets are also tested for impairment at this point in time. An impairment loss recognized in goodwill is not reversible. With respect to all other impaired assets an impairment loss recognized in prior periods is only reversed such as it affects the consolidated income statement if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.

1545,adidas assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease according to IFRS Leases at the inception of the contract. IFRS defines a lease as a contract that conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. A contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset if the lessee has the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset e.g. by having the exclusive right to use the asset throughout that period and the right to direct the use of the identified asset throughout the period of use. In its role as a lessee adidas leases various types of assets particularly buildings retail stores offices warehouses etc. land technical equipment and machinery warehouse equipment production machines etc. motor vehicles and computer hardware as well as furniture and fixtures. Lease contracts are typically negotiated for fixed periods of up to years but may include extension or termination options. Lease terms are negotiated individually and may contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. adidas makes use of the recognition exemption in IFRS to not recognize rightofuse assets and lease liabilities for leases of lowvalue assets i.e. value of the underlying asset when new is or less and shortterm leases shorter than twelve months and the agreement does not include a purchase option. Lease payments for lowvalue leases are recognized as expenses as they are incurred over the lease term. Furthermore adidas exercises the option for lessees to combine lease payments with payments for nonlease components in the calculation of the lease liability and rightofuse asset for all lease asset classes except for corporate real estate. adidas recognizes a rightofuse asset and a corresponding lease liability at the lease commencement date. At the commencement date adidas initially measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. This includes fixed payments including insubstance fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable variable lease payments based on an index or a rate amounts expected to be payable by adidas under residual value guarantees the exercise price of a purchase option if adidas is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. Other variable lease payments are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined adidas uses its incremental borrowing rate. Generally adidas uses the incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. It is adjusted to reflect the countryspecific risk the credit risk of adidas collateral from the change in value of the leased asset the contract currencyspecific risk and the lease term. ,,,,,,,,,,,,0.32844690264868287,,,,,,,
1546,After the commencement date lease payments are split into redemption payments and interest payments. The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest cost on the lease liability using the effective interest rate and reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made. The carrying amount of the lease liability is remeasured provided any reassessmentslease modifications occur including changes in the assessment of whether an extension or termination option is reasonably certain to be exercised. At the commencement date the rightofuse asset is initially measured at cost which is comprised of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee and an estimate of costs to be incurred by adidas in dismantling and removing the underlying asset restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease. The rightofuse asset is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. In ,,,,,,0.37380136560621957,,,,,,0.37950941220335854,,,,,,,
1547,principle the rightofuse asset is depreciated on a straightline basis over the lease term or the useful life of the leased asset whichever is shorter. adidas applies judgment in determining the lease term for lease contracts including extension or termination options. The assessment of whether the options are reasonably certain to be exercised has an impact on the lease term and therefore may significantly affect the measurement of lease liabilities and rightofuse assets respectively. Lease contract renegotiations that result in changes to the original contractual conditions e.g. changes in scope consideration including discounts and concessions or lease term are treated as lease modifications. Depending on the circumstances of the renegotiation either lease modifications are accounted for as a new separate contract or they trigger a remeasurement of the lease liability using the discounted future lease payments. In the latter case a corresponding adjustment is made to the rightofuse asset with in some instances a difference recognized in profit or loss. Lease reassessments are the result of changes in assumptions or judgments such as changes in lease term due to amended estimates surrounding existing extension and termination options. It is necessary to remeasure the lease liability using the discounted or existing future lease payments and make a corresponding adjustment to the rightofuse asset. ,,,,,,,,,,,,0.34161121649685705,,,,,,,
1553,Expenditure during the development phase of internally generated intangible assets is capitalized as incurred if it fulfills the recognition criteria under IAS Intangible Assets. Development costs for internally generated intangible assets are capitalized from the date on which the recognition criteria set out in IAS Intangible Assets are first met. The capitalized development costs are amortized on a systematic basis from the day the intangible assets are available for use. ,0.31340678699407604,0.30183834655410585,0.4056974096795435,,,0.4606402732663181,,,,,,,,,,0.3215714162426796,,,

1558,Borrowings and other liabilities ,,,,,,,,,,,0.42920366051099856,,,,,,,,
1559,Borrowings e.g. Eurobonds and other liabilities are recognized at fair value net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods borrowings are stated at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Any difference between proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognized in the consolidated income statement over the term of the borrowing. Compound financial instruments e.g. convertible bonds are divided into a liability component shown under borrowings and into an equity component resulting from conversion rights. The equity component is included in the capital reserve. The fair value of the liability component is determined by discounting the interest and principal payments of a comparable liability without conversion rights applying riskadjusted interest rates. The liability component is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The equity component is determined as the difference between the fair value of the total compound financial instrument and the fair value of the liability component and is reported within equity. There is no subsequent measurement of the equity component. At initial recognition directly attributable transaction costs are assigned to the equity and liability component pro rata on the basis of the respective carrying amounts. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.2719077772024384,,,
1560,Provisions and accrued liabilities ,,,,,,,,,0.3539768269869776,,,,,,,,,,
1561,Provisions are recognized when there is a present obligation legal or constructive to third parties that has been incurred as a result of a past event when the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably and when it is probable that there will be an outflow of resources. In general all provisions are uncertain as to their maturity or amount. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the consolidated income statement. Noncurrent provisions are discounted if the effect of the time value of money is material with the interest expense being reported as financial expenses. ,,,,,,,,0.3661044451722094,0.41587387520185265,0.3059867830401352,,,,,0.35621074253408,,,,
1564,Provisions and expenses for pensions and similar obligations relate to the companys obligations for defined benefit and defined contribution plans. The obligations under defined benefit plans are determined separately for each plan by valuing the employee benefits accrued in return for their service during the current and prior periods. These benefit accruals are discounted to calculate their present value and the ,,,,,,,,,0.36128587761794934,,0.44637109879362574,,,,,,0.2818502267020089,,
1565,fair value of any plan assets is deducted in order to determine the net liability. The discount rate is set on the basis of yields of highquality fixedrate corporate bonds at the balance sheet date provided there is a deep market for such corporate bonds in a given currency. Otherwise government bond yields are used as a reference. Calculations are performed by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method in accordance with IAS Employee Benefits. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as an expense in the consolidated income statement as incurred. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.2761877469786762,,,
1571,Revenue derived from the sale of goods is recognized when adidas has satisfied the respective performance obligation by transferring the promised goods to the customer. The goods are transferred at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the respective goods. The timing of the transfer of control depends on the individual terms of the sales agreement terms of delivery. The amount of revenue to be recognized is determined based on the consideration adidas expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to the customer taking into account returns discounts and rebates. Under certain conditions and in accordance with contractual agreements the companys customers have the right to return products and to either exchange them for similar or other products or to return the products against the issuance of a credit note. Amounts for estimated returns related to revenues are accrued based on past experience of average return rates and average actual return periods by means of a refund liability. The return assets are measured at the carrying amount of the inventoriesproducts less any handling costs and any potential impairment. Provided that the customers meet certain predefined conditions adidas grants its customers different types of globally aligned performancebased rebates. Examples include rebates for customers increasing adidas product sales for customer loyalty and for sellout support e.g. through retail spacefranchise store management. As soon as it is assumed that the customer fulfills the requirements for being granted the rebate this amount is recognized as a sales deduction via an accrued liability for marketing and sales. In addition adidas generates revenue from the licensingout of the right to use the brands to third parties. The resulting salesbased royalty and commission income is recognized based on the contract terms on an accrual basis i.e. revenue is already realized even though the payment takes place at a later point in time. Contracts with guaranteed minimum income result in contract assets and contract liabilities ,,,,,,,0.44004717120550113,,,,,,,,,,,,
1572,depending on the timing of yearly payments received from customers. The performance obligation related to these contract assets and liabilities is satisfied over the life of the contract i.e. the guaranteed minimum income per year is evenly distributed over twelve months whereby payments are recorded as arranged in the contract with the customer. ,,,,,,0.3273094346324214,,,0.33456282664128517,,,0.3075995667892882,,,,0.2600784572058331,,,

Significant costs for media campaigns are expensed on a straightline basis over the intended duration of the media campaign. Promotional expenses including onetime upfront payments for promotion contracts are principally expensed on a straightline basis over the term of the agreement. ,,,,,,,,0.35151057146741704,0.38747589125662224,0.32208984545596453,,,,,,,,,
1576,Interest is recognized as income or expense as incurred using the effective interest method with the exception of interest that is directly attributable to the acquisition construction or production of a qualifying asset. This interest is capitalized as part of the cost of the qualifying asset. Interest paid is presented within the net cash used in financing activities. ,0.32602844437504014,,,,,0.3256036254602786,,,,,,0.310318991046311,,,,,,,
1578,adidas receives government grants in the form of subsidies subventions or premiums from local national or international government authorities such as those of the Free State of Bavaria the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Union. Government grants are recognized if there is adequate certainty that the grants will be received and that the company satisfies the conditions attached. Government grants are reported in the consolidated income statement as a deduction from the related expenses. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3462511272224571,,,,
1586,Serviceindependent and nonmarket performance conditions are not taken into account when determining the fair value of awards at the grant date but the likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed as part of the companys best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. If the estimate is changed even a credit in the consolidated income statement for the period can be possible as it reflects the movement in cumulative expenses from the beginning to the end of that period. No expense is recognized for awards that do not ultimately vest if nonmarket performance andor service conditions have not been met. Equitysettled sharebased payment transactions with parties other than employees are generally measured at the fair value of the goods or services received except where the fair value cannot be estimated reliably in which case they are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders the service. For cashsettled sharebased payment transactions the goods or services acquired and the liability incurred are measured at the fair value of the liability. Until the liability is settled the fair value of the liability is remeasured at the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement with all changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss for the period. ,,,,,,,,,0.32437071832547165,,0.44238296544958766,,,,,0.2757256886955617,,,

1865,A credit risk arises if a customer or other counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. adidas is exposed to credit risks from its operating activities and from certain financing activities. Credit risks arise principally from accounts receivable and to a lesser extent from other thirdparty contractual financial obligations such as other financial assets shortterm bank deposits and derivative financial instruments. Without taking into account any collateral or other credit enhancements the carrying amount of financial assets and accounts receivable represents the maximum exposure to credit risk. At the end of there was no relevant concentration of credit risk by type of customer or geography. The companys credit risk exposure is mainly influenced by individual customer characteristics. Under the companys credit policy new customers are analyzed for creditworthiness before standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. Tolerance limits for accounts receivable are also established for each customer. Both creditworthiness and accounts receivable limits are monitored on an ongoing basis. Customers that fail to meet the companys minimum creditworthiness are in general allowed to purchase products only on a prepayment basis. Other activities to mitigate credit risks include retention of title clauses as well as on a selective basis credit insurance the sale of accounts receivable without recourse and bank guarantees.

The group applies the exception to recognizing and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes as provided in the amendments to IAS issued in May .

The group is in the process of assessing the impact of the Pillar Two legislation. Based on prior years and the accounting profit for the financial year this assessment process results in an additional expected tax exposure in a low two digit million range. The group might not be exposed to paying Pillar Two income taxes in relation to most jurisdictions. This is due to the impact of specific adjustments envisaged in the Pillar Two legislation which give rise to different effective tax rates compared to those calculated in accordance with paragraph of IAS .

2059,At the start of the financial year the Groups internal reporting structure was adjusted for management purposes. Since January the EMEA market has been divided into two separate markets Europe and Emerging Markets. Russia is allocated to the other businesses as it is no longer monitored separately by the chief operating decisionmakers due to the discontinuation of business activities. In addition the AsiaPacific market has been split into two separate markets Japan and South Korea and Southeast Asia and Pacific have been merged with the new Emerging Markets market. The North America Latin America and China markets remain unchanged. In line with this reporting structure of the company for management purposes by market and in accordance with the definition of IFRS Operating Segments seven operating segments have thus been identified as of January Europe Emerging Markets North America China Latin America Japan and South Korea. Due to the small size of the two operating segments Japan and South Korea they are combined for external segment reporting as JapanSouth Korea. Due to the change in the operating segments and the associated groups of cashgenerating units both a reallocation of goodwill and an impairment test of goodwill were carried out as at January .

2089,. In the Companys consolidated statement of financial position inventories amounting to EUR million of total assets are reported. Inventories are initially recognized at cost taking into account directly attributable incidental acquisition costs and cost reductions. The carrying amount of recognized inventories must be reduced if the inventories are damaged or partially obsolete and the expected net realizable values are less than the costs. At the balance sheet date the costs are compared against the net realizable values which are determined by deducting the directly attributable selling costs to be incurred prior to sale of the inventories from the sales proceeds expected to be generated. ,,,,0.3334955212647758,0.4069806116871003,,0.46881185340158266,0.41424091455951867,,,,,,0.38796104766610073,,,,,0.37743015831279536
2090,Net realizable values are calculated based on discretionary planning assumptions as to the sales proceeds realizable in the ordinary course of business less necessary selling costs which are derived on the basis of historical observable data. In particular the age seasonality of the inventories and the selected sales channel to be used in future sales are significant. The impairment test resulted in a writedown on inventories as of the balance sheet date amounting to EUR million in total. The outcome of this valuation is dependent to a large extent on the estimates made by the executive directors with respect to the inputs for the future net realizable values and other factors having an influence on value and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Against this background and due to the complex nature of the valuation this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit. . As part of our audit we analyzed among other things the impairment testing process and assessed identified controls with respect to implementation appropriateness and operating effectiveness. Furthermore we evaluated the key inputs used to calculate net realizable values based on historical data and our understanding of the business. We verified the mathematical accuracy of the calculation logic used in the impairment test. We were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors in connection with the appropriate measurement of inventories were sufficiently substantiated and documented. . The Companys disclosures relating to the accounting policies applied with respect to the inventories line item are contained in section of the notes to the consolidated financial statements Summary of significant accounting policies. In addition the disclosures on inventories are contained in section Inventories. ,,,,,,,0.4514388999522907,,,,,,,,,,,,
2092,. In the Companys consolidated financial statements revenues amounting to EUR million are reported. Revenue is recognized from the sale of goods in the Wholesale Ecommerce and Own retail sales channels if the Company satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a specified asset to a customer. An asset is deemed to have been transferred if the customer obtains control of that asset. Revenue is recognized in the amount to which the Company has a claim when the power to control an asset is transferred. Customers of the Company have the option subject to certain conditions of exchanging or returning goods in exchange for a credit. The amounts regarding expected returns are estimated by the executive directors based on experiences with regard to historic return rates and accrued for a return provision against revenues. The asset embodying the right to receive goods returned by the customer is measured at the carrying amount of the respective inventories less settlement costs. The revenues have a significant influence on the Groups net profit or loss for the year and represent one of the most significant performance indicators for adidas. Due to the large transaction volume with respect to the sale of merchandise in three different sales channels and the potential risk in general of notional revenues and the uncertainty with regard to estimates of expected returns in our view the ,,,,,,,0.4250619555980814,,,,,,,,,,,,
2093,existence and accrual of revenues from the sale of merchandise were of particular significance in the context of our audit. . With respect to the audit of the existence and accrual of revenue we first assessed the design implementation and operating effectiveness of internal controls including the functioning of ITbased controls with respect to outgoing goods and the acceptance of goods invoices and the payment settlement. In addition we examined the presentation of revenue recognition in the Groupwide accounting policy to assess whether it complied with IFRS . Furthermore in the context of substantive audit procedures we obtained evidence in particular delivery certificates invoices and receipts of payments of the existence and accrual of revenue in order to assess whether the recognized and accrues revenues were based on a corresponding shipment or transfer of goods. In addition we evaluated the mathematical correctness of the executive directors calculation of expected returns. We compared the expected returns against historical sales channelspecific return rates and the returned merchandise recorded in the financial accounting records. We were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors in connection with the appropriate accounting treatment of the revenue were sufficiently substantiated and documented. . The Companys disclosures relating to the accounting policies applied with respect to the recognition of revenue from merchandise are contained in section of the notes to the consolidated financial statements Summary of significant accounting policies. ,,,,,,,0.5466249852612174,0.4115757263431325,,,,,,0.3806017183077973,,,,,
