Net financial assets are calculated as the difference between cash cash equivalents and time deposits shown in the statement of financial position plus current debt instruments subsequently referred to as liquid funds and noncurrent and current financial debt. As of September the group had liquid funds of . billion which after deducting gross financial debt of . billion results in net financial assets of . billion. Mainly as the result of positive effects from free cash flow . billion net financial assets were above the prioryear level September . billion. A . billion bond was repaid on maturity in February . The groups available liquidity was . billion as of September . It comprised liquid funds of . billion and undrawn committed credit lines of . billion. Consequently there is enough scope to cover debt maturities. The gross financial debt repayable in fiscal year amounts to . billion.

In particular financial assets include trade accounts receivable cash and cash equivalents derivative financial assets as well as equity and debt instruments. Trade accounts receivable are initially measured at the transaction price other financial assets are initially recognized at fair value. This includes any transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets which are not carried at fair value through profit or loss in future periods. The fair values recognized on the balance sheet usually reflect the market prices of the financial assets. The classification and measurement of financial assets is based on the financial assets cash flow characteristics and on thyssenkrupps business model for managing the financial assets. Different business models may apply for separate portfolios of identical debt instruments e.g. where factoring programs exist for certain trade accounts receivable. If a debt instrument is held with the objective of collecting contractual cash flows and if the cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest the instrument is recognized at amortized cost. At thyssenkrupp this mainly concerns trade accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents without money market funds as well as the interestfree loans resulting from the Elevator investment see Note . Money market funds are measured at fair value through profit or loss. If the cash flow conditions are met but the debt instrument is held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell the instrument is measured at fair value in equity with recycling. At thyssenkrupp this mainly concerns trade accounts receivable which may be sold and securities. For equity instruments not held for trading with the exemption of the preference shares of the Elevator investment thyssenkrupp has consistently exercised the option to recognize future changes in fair value in profit or loss. However changes in fair value of the preference shares are directly recognized in equity without recycling. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are also recognized at fair value in profit or loss.

In the group the majority of reported plan assets associated with the funded pension plans are located in the USA Great Britain Liechtenstein and to a lesser extent in Germany and some other European countries. The group invests in diversified portfolios consisting of an array of asset classes that attempt to maximize returns while minimizing volatility. The asset classes mainly include national and international stocks fixed income government and nongovernment securities real estate and shares in highly diversified funds. Plan assets do not include any direct investments in thyssenkrupp debt securities treasury shares or real estate used on its own. The group uses professional investment managers to invest plan assets based on specific investment guidelines. The Investment Committees of the respective plan consist of senior financial management especially from treasury and other appropriate executives. The Investment Committees meet regularly to review the risks and performance of the major assets and approve the selection and retention of external managers. For the groups main pension assets regular asset liability studies are also carried out in which actuaries conduct a detailed analysis of the structure of the pension obligations among other things in terms of age structure duration possible interest rateinflation risks. On this basis the investment strategy and target portfolio of the pension assets are then defined and updated. For risk management purposes liabilitydriven investment strategies may be used through which assets are geared towards the pension liabilities. The processes established for managing and monitoring the plan assets as described above are used to counter the usual risks associated with capital market investment counterparty liquiditymarket and other risks.

The groups net obligation for defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plans have been calculated for each plan using the projected unit credit method as of the balance sheet date. A quarterly valuation of pensions is performed on the basis of updated interest rates and fair values of plan assets. As far as the fair value of plan assets related to pensions or similar obligations exceeds the corresponding obligation the recognition of an asset in respect to such surplus is limited. As far as in connection with plan assets minimum funding requirements related to past service exist an additional liability may need to be recognized in case the economic benefit of a surplus already taking into account the contributions to be made in respect of the minimum funding requirements is limited. The limit is determined by the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan asset asset ceiling. With the exception of net interest all income and expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in incomeloss from operations. Net interest included in net periodic pension cost is recognized in net financial incomeexpense in the groups statement of income. The groups obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as expense in incomeloss from operations as incurred. The effects of remeasurements of pensions and similar obligations are recognized in other comprehensive income and reported in retained earnings. They consist of actuarial gains and losses the return on plan assets and changes in the effects of asset ceiling excluding amounts already included in net interest. Deferred taxes relating to remeasurements are also recognized in other comprehensive income. The group also maintains multiemployer plans. In principle these multiemployer plans contain defined benefit plans as well as defined contribution plans. With respect to defined benefit multiemployer plans these are accounted for in the same way as any other defined benefit plan in case the required information is available. Otherwise these plans are accounted for as defined contribution plans. In particular in the Netherlands there exist multiemployer defined benefit plans that are accounted for as defined contribution plans due to the fact that the pension obligations and the plan assets cannot be assigned to the participating employers.

A financial instrument is any contract that at the same time gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial instruments are recognized as soon as thyssenkrupp becomes a contracting party to the financial instrument. In cases where trade date and settlement date do not coincide for nonderivative financial instruments the settlement date is used for initial recognition or derecognition while for derivatives the trade date is used. Financial instruments stated as financial assets or financial liabilities are generally not offset they are only offset when a legal right to setoff exists at that time and settlement on a net basis is intended.

Turnover is the main parameter used as the basis for technical screening criteria for assessing the taxonomy alignment of business activities. This applies analogously to capital and operating expenditures associated with these business activities irrespective of their intended purpose. For example on the basis of their intended purpose capital expenditures for a business activity could potentially be allocated to a different economic activity listed in the delegated acts which in turn could involve different screening criteria. This is ruled out by applying the principle that turnover has the priority. In the case of business activities allocated to a research and developmentrelated economic activity on the basis of turnover the technical screening criteria are derived from capital and operating expenditure.
