141,In fiscal year a divestment process was initiated for the activities of thyssenkrupp Industries India which was part of the Decarbon Technologies segment. This transaction was completed on May and thyssenkrupp Industries India was therefore deconsolidated. Also in fiscal year a divestment process was initiated for the activities of thyssenkrupp Electrical Steel India which is part of the Steel Europe segment. These activities met the criteria set forth in IFRS for recognition as a disposal group for the first time in the th quarter of . Therefore the assets and liabilities relating to these activities have to be presented separately in the statement of financial position as of September . The business performance is presented by segment. The GCGC contains recommendations for disclosures on the internal control and risk management system that go beyond the statutory requirements for the management report and are therefore outside the scope of the audit of the content of the management report performed by the auditor.

288,demand in Turkey due to reconstruction following the spring earthquake has not continued this year. Tighter financial conditions to curb high inflation rates are holding back steel industry development. EU demand for finished steel decreased by . as a consequence of the war in Ukraine and the weak economic environment in . Due to the continuing cyclical weakness a further decline in demand of . is anticipated for the current year. Germany in particular will contribute a decline of .. In again the development of the global steel market remains beset with high risks due to the ongoing geopolitical crises and growing protectionism in international trade. In following the decrease a year earlier the EU market for flat carbon steel declined by a further . to . million tons. The main causes of this include the ongoing negative impacts of the war in Ukraine high energy prices and inflation as well as the continuing weakness of the global economy. Following a brief upturn in demand in the first half of declining economic momentum in the second half of the year resulted in a renewed decline in demand. Whereas deliveries from the EU plants still served most of the growing demand at the start of imports increased significantly over the course of the year. In as a whole . million tons of flat steel products were imported into the EU. This accounted for . of the EU market only slightly below the prioryear figure .. In the st half of demand for flat steel dropped to . million tons . below the weak prioryear level of . million tons. The weak demand was additionally impacted by a significant yearonyear rise in imports increase of . to a market share of .. By contrast deliveries from the EU plants declined .. The main industries that process flat steel and are relevant to us such as the automotive industry engineering and construction continued to see low order intake. Many companies are still working off their decreasing order backlogs which has prevented a stronger decline in production to date. A lack of economic impetus is dampening the outlook for the rest of the year and a recovery in demand in the EU is not expected until at the earliest. The recovery in demand at the start of the st quarter of as a result of the improved economic outlook continued to have a positive impact on spot price trends in the EU flat steel market until April. Thereafter weakening demand and increased pressure from imports caused a decline in prices. Mirroring demand trends prices recovered slightly for a time from fall but trended downward again from March . Until August the spot prices remained stable at a low level due to low economic momentum. They have been moving downward since the start of September. In the first nine months of iron ore prices were on average . lower than in the prior year. In the same period the prices of coking coal fell by . compared with a year earlier. For the global steel industry association anticipates only a slight increase of . in world steel demand due to a further decline of . in demand in China primarily as a result of a continuing decrease in demand from the real estate industry. The increase will by boosted by continuing high growth in demand in India especially .. The forecast for the EU market assumes growth of . with Germany expected to contribute an increase of . after the very low levels in the prior years. For the USA demand for finished steel is expected to rise by .. However the outlook is beset by great uncertainty. Whether demand actually develops in line with the forecast will depend on whether the anticipated and repeatedly postponed economic recovery occurs or whether the dampening factors described above continue to dominate. ,,,0.4058709980462363,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main reasons for this were lower prices in our key customer and product groups as well as declining demand at both Steel Europe and Materials Services.

Thanks to the high order intake in the prior period ongoing major projects at Uhde and the growth of water electrolysis Decarbon Technologies significantly increased sales yearonyear.

467,Sales declined in the reporting period and were lower than in the prior year. The main reasons for this were price and volumeinduced declines in the businesses of the Materials Services and Steel Europe segments as well as a drop in sales in the automotive businesses. They were offset by sales increases in the plant engineering businesses of the Decarbon Technologies segment and in the marine businesses. At the same time the cost of sales decreased by which was out of proportion to the sales trend. The main reasons were significantly lower materials expenses lower energy expenses a yearonyear decline in impairment losses including impairment losses on corporate assets in the Steel Europe segment by million from million to million and the resulting lower depreciation and amortization. The main offsetting effects in the reporting year were expenses arising from the market valuation of commodity derivatives and higher personnel expenses in connection with collective wage agreements and restructuring measures. In addition higher costs were incurred in the reporting year for individual legacy plant engineering projects at Polysius cement industry part of the Decarbon Technologies segment. Overall both the gross profit of million and the gross margin of . were higher than in the prior year. The increase in research and development costs resulted especially from higher personnel expenses also in connection with restructuring measures in the Decarbon Technologies segment. In addition impairment losses increased by million to million. The rise in selling expenses primarily concerned impairment losses that increased by million to a total of million in the reporting year and personnel expenses in connection with restructuring measures in the Materials Services segment these were offset especially by a decline in salesrelated freight expenses. General and administrative expenses more or less matched the prioryear level mainly due to impairment losses in the Steel Europe segment that were million lower at million they were offset especially by higher personnel expenses. The principal reasons for the increase in other income were higher income in connection with compensation for electricity prices in the Steel Europe segment income from the entry into effect of a supply agreement classified as an embedded lease in the Materials Services segment and income from charging on costs to subsuppliers for remedying quality deficits in customer contracts in the Automotive Technology segment. The increase in other expenses resulted especially from the impairment loss of million recognized on goodwill in the st half of the reporting year in connection with the thyssenkrupp Industries India disposal group that existed until its sale at the start of May . Also in the reporting year the Steel Europe segment incurred costs in connection with a hydrogen pipeline and the Automotive Technology segment incurred costs for remedying quality deficits in customer contracts. ,,0.33804651583562967,,,,,0.44223643673166835,,,,,,,,,,,,

474,There was a reduction in total noncurrent assets compared with the prior year. The decrease in intangible assets included in this figure was mainly caused by the deconsolidation of thyssenkrupp Industries India at the start of May and the impairment losses recognized in the Materials Services segment million Steel Europe segment million and Automotive Technology segment million in the reporting year. The overall decline in property plant and equipment was mainly due to impairment losses recognized in the reporting period in the Steel Europe segment million Materials Services segment million and Automotive Technology segment million and to currency translation. This was countered especially by transfers of advance payments from other nonfinancial assets in connection with the construction of the direct reduction plant in the Steel Europe segment. The reduction in investments accounted for using the equity method was mainly due to the subsequent measurement in the reporting year of the ordinary shares recognized in connection with the Elevator investment. The increase in receivables from finance leases mainly concerned the Materials Services segment. The increase in other financial assets mainly concerned the subsequent measurement of the interestfree loan and preference shares recognized in connection with the Elevator investment this was offset by the deconsolidation of thyssenkrupp Industries India. The reduction in other nonfinancial assets resulted primarily from lower advance payments on property plant and equipment as a consequence of the aforementioned transfers to property plant and equipment. Total current assets of million were significantly lower by million than in the prior year. The decline in inventories contained therein mainly concerned the materials businesses in the Materials Services segment and were induced by both prices and volumes. In addition declines resulted from the deconsolidation of thyssenkrupp Industries India at the start of May and from reclassifications in connection with the assets held for sale in the thyssenkrupp Electrical Steel India disposal group. Increases in inventories primarily in the Automotive Technology and Marine Systems segments had an opposing effect. The decrease in trade accounts receivable resulted mainly from business and sales trends in the Materials Services and Steel Europe segments alongside the aforementioned deconsolidation of thyssenkrupp Industries India and the reclassifications in connection with the assets held for sale in the thyssenkrupp Electrical Steel India disposal group this was offset by increases at Marine Systems in connection with the invoicing of orders. The reduction of contract assets was due in particular to the execution of construction contracts in the plant engineering businesses of the Decarbon Technologies segment which were also impacted by the deconsolidation of thyssenkrupp Industries India. The decline resulted likewise from the execution of construction contracts in the plant engineering businesses of the Automotive Technology segment and from currency translation. The decrease in other financial assets resulted primarily from the recognition of CO,,0.3316426121005867,,0.3500754033046756,0.3773247849386907,0.34505543697388186,0.40493986572002405,0.3751886890507861,,,,,,,,,,,

488,The goal of our financial management is to ensure our solvency at all times. The financing of the group is handled centrally by thyssenkrupp AG enabling a uniform presence on the capital markets and is based on a multiyear financial planning system and a monthly rolling liquidity planning system covering a planning period of up to one year. Our cash management systems allow subsidiaries to use surplus funds of other units to cover their liquidity requirements. This reduces the volume of external financing and thus interest expense. External financing requirements are covered using money and capital market instruments such as bonds loan notes or commercial paper. Moreover where required derivative financial instruments are used for hedging purposes. We can also make use of committed credit facilities in various currencies and with various terms as well as selected offbalancesheet financing instruments such as factoring programs. Information on the available credit facilities is provided in Note . ,,,,0.3535060898655162,,,,,,,0.4391428496107725,,,,,,,,

562,Our environmental climate and energy management systems are based on the groups global environmental and energy policy and a corresponding group regulation. This regulation requires all companies with environmentally relevant activities for example because they operate plants that are subject to environmental permits to implement and maintain an environmental management system in accordance with ISO . With the aid of certified environmental management systems we are continuously improving the environmental performance of our sites in order to fulfill our ambitious environmental targets. Throughout the life cycle of our products and processes we raise efficiency in the use of resources and minimize harmful emissions. We are aware of our ecological and social responsibility. Our binding obligations include both compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and respecting environmentally relevant due diligence obligations. Activities regarded as environmentally relevant are defined in our group regulation. Since fiscal year many environmentally relevant thyssenkrupp group companies within the meaning of this regulation have had an environmental management system certified in accordance with ISO . In the reporting period around of thyssenkrupp sites in terms of the total workforce had an environmental management system that was implemented and certified in accordance with ISO . ,,0.3529061696372419,0.4299036645738077,0.3860022880274025,0.44618077888354934,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
564,thyssenkrupps energy consumption came to around terawatt hours TWh in fiscal year . Energy efficiency plays an important role at thyssenkrupp. For nine years the global Groupwide Energy Efficiency Program GEEP has included measures such as process optimizations better use of waste heat and the replacement of plant components and lighting systems. In the reporting year we set ourselves the target of increasing energy efficiency in the group by GWh. We significantly exceeded this target with an improvement of some GWh. Taking into account the specific emissions of each energy source these efficiency gains add up to the avoidance of about tons of greenhouse gas emissions. The goal for fiscal year is to achieve further efficiency gains of at least GWh. Since fiscal year many group companies with energyrelevant activities have implemented an energy management system and had it externally certified in accordance with ISO . Among other things this includes setting specific energy targets for each relevant company measuring energy consumption and optimizing organizational and technical processes. In terms of groupwide energy consumption this means around of energy management activities at thyssenkrupp met the ISO standard in fiscal year .

572,As well as continuing to drive forward the green transformation of our own processes we deliver numerous innovative solutions that offer our customers support in implementing their own climate and resourcesaving processes and introducing more sustainable products. The most prominent example of our green transformation is our target of climateneutral steel production by at the latest. The key element in achieving this target is the construction of our first direct reduction plant and two smelters at the Duisburg site. The two electricitypowered smelting units enable the direct reduction plant to be integrated smoothly into the existing production network. This has the big advantage that all established tried and tested processes at the oxygen steelworks in Duisburg can be retained. This is where the liquid product is processed into the wellknown steel grades. You can find further information in the section Segment review subsection Steel Europe. In a project partnership with a customer and an industrial partner Uhde is developing sustainable solutions for the chemical industry from laboratory scale to industrial maturity. The manufacture of phosphoric acid for use in phosphate fertilizers generates large amounts of phosphogypsum as a byproduct. Uhde is developing a process to purify and process the phosphogypsum for use in the construction industry for example. This avoids the need for landbased storage or dumping at sea. In addition the phosphogypsum can be reacted with CO,,,,,0.4284384035123639,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

614,The occupational safety and health of employees remained an important element of thyssenkrupps HR work in the past fiscal year. Also of key significance are the personnelrelated measures accompanying the transformation of the businesses and the strategic development of thyssenkrupp. In light of the current labor market situation recruiting and retaining employees remains very important as well. In addition we are continuing to drive the transition towards new ways of working and a productive working environment. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3678606654149756,,,,0.27431370800542576,,
615,We give the highest priority to occupational health and safety at the workplace. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.2543546243285701,,

Our goal is to continuously improve our occupational safety and health management thus avoiding accidents workrelated illnesses and stress. Our managers have a special role in this. OSH will continue to focus on the resilience of employees and managers for a further three years. The leaders care initiative especially supports managers in exercising their responsibility to ensure safe and healthy working conditions healthy selfmanagement and good conduct towards employees. In the interest of continuously improving occupational safety thyssenkrupp monitors the companys accident situation. The accident frequency rate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.2600727741170679,,

The value of . did not meet our target for the past fiscal year. We did not record any fatal accidents involving thyssenkrupp employees in the reporting period. Nevertheless unplanned events occurred and we continue to work with our partners to avoid these in the future. At thyssenkrupp we are not only concerned for our own employees. In the area of occupational safety we also keep an eye on the contractors working for us. The declared aim is to apply our own standards at contractors as well. To further enhance management of our contractors we continued the crosssegment focus dialog initiated in . The primary goal here is to identify potential and define measures for improving the selection of contractors and for monitoring their activities on site. We expect to complete the focus dialog in fiscal year . This year too we will be using the we care days to focus on important occupational safety and health topics. The motto Your health matters Keep on going was enhanced and some new modules were added for the topics of medical screening and preventive care examinations nutrition exercise resilience stress management and we stop reloaded that were the focus of the we care days.

629,In fiscal year the thyssenkrupp Academy prioritized strengthening and developing the organizational skills of the businesses with the goal of improving their performance. In addition the wide range of individual development opportunities with programs in the open curriculum and specific solutions for individual internal teams supported employees in their daily challenges. In the past fiscal year the Academys offering concentrated on the Focus Performance Enablers defined in the context of the APEX performance program. These are the behaviors and mindsets backed by specific methods and tools that serve as the framework for a forwardlooking organization. The focus was on the five enablers referred to strategic clarity and KPIbased management added value for and from customers autonomous employees an innovative and agile organization and continuous improvement. The starting point of the Focus process was an analysis of the status quo for these enablers in each business the Focus Assessment. The findings of this assessment were then discussed with the businesses to define action areas and specific measures. Other formats based on the Focus Performance Enablers are planned for fiscal year in support of the transformation. As well as supporting the transformation the thyssenkrupp Academy has developed courses on artificial intelligence AI the topic of the future that has a firm place on thyssenkrupps strategic agenda. Managers and employees can choose from a varied range of training including videos on the principles of AI online impulse sessions and classroom formats. As we are aware of the critical challenges presented by the new ways of working the topics of healthy leadership and resilience were a further focus of the thyssenkrupp Academy in fiscal year . ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.419248518362449,,,,,,
631,The high quality of the programs offered by the thyssenkrupp Academy is shown by renewed certification in conformance with ISO .

632,Talent development and specific networking formats ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.38381908765719264,,,,,,
633,In the past fiscal year thyssenkrupp once again identified more than talents worldwide i.e. employees with the potential for more senior specialist and leadership roles. We aim to develop the potential of these employees and give them more challenging roles. The main responsibility for this lies with the businesses. Intensive sharing of best practices and various networking formats within the personnel development community enable us to leverage synergies and secure the high standard of the programs. Some of the courses specifically address female talents in order to foster their development and further improve their career opportunities. This provides a varied development landscape for talented employees with opportunities to network raise their visibility within the organization and prepare for future specialist and leadership tasks. Targeted development is supported by regular development dialogs feedback and the use of diagnostic methods to determine their status quo. Crosssegment networking formats such as the Talent Summit various forums and workshops contribute to the development and retention of this important target group. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.47504475727130446,,,,,,
634,Apprentice training still a central element for securing skilled employees ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.2841777823741522,,,
635,Apprentice training is a particular priority at thyssenkrupp which is why we organized a companywide training event in Essen in the reporting year. The thyssenkrupp training team consulted apprentices with the goal of making the companys apprenticeship training more attractive. In the reporting period thyssenkrupp had more than apprentices in Germany prior year more than training for different occupations. In Germany the apprentice training rate the ratio of apprenticeship places to the total workforce remained constant at . prior year .. thyssenkrupp offers people the option of either a classic apprenticeship or an integrated degree course. Since filling our apprenticeship places is very challenging we use a wide range of measures to interest young people in an apprenticeship. These include employer branding advertising campaigns simplifying the application process and organizing digital parents evenings in collaboration with the Federal Employment Agency. Our activities to counter the shortage of skilled workers are strengthened by a regular exchange with companies outside the thyssenkrupp group for example through what we refer to as the Allianz der Chancen the initiative for new ways of working in which currently companies address topics such as strengthening vocational training. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3507389951089533,,,0.2979997758949937,,,

648,Companywide networking crossfunctional collaboration and sharing knowledge remain central issues that thyssenkrupp is working on intensively. The companys we.match networking platform contributes to this it is a modular platform to which a third application was added in the past fiscal year. Alongside the peopleprojects module for companywide temporary project deployments and the Call a Colleague module that enables employees to support each other in dealing with specific issues a third module named Communities was launched. This new module helps employees to identify each other easily and come together when they face similar issues or are working on similar topics. For example this may result in the establishment of regular discussion groups in which functional experts address crosssegment topics. The we.match platform was launched in May and currently encompasses users projects Call a Colleague profiles and communities. In the future we will be focusing more on artificial intelligence AI as a key technology and its use in operational and production processes. It will play an important role in securing our competitive advantages. To ensure the responsible use of AI systems we have developed an AI policy that applies worldwide to the introduction and deployment of AI systems by the company. It provides everyone involved with a valuebased framework for leveraging the opportunities of artificial intelligence while minimizing any potential legal risks thereby facilitating the efficient and successful use of AI as a key future technology. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.4629726620291541,,,,,,
650,Mobile and hybrid working is another key topic in the changing world of work. The introduction of the hybrid working agenda in the past fiscal year facilitated mobile working for employees in suitable jobs. This not only responds to employees changed expectations but also gives the company the opportunity to deploy new space concepts that offer considerable scope for optimization and cost benefits. Since the fall of in order to remain an attractive employer and to attract and retain talented employees thyssenkrupp has offered those employees in Germany who already use mobile and hybrid working models a further option for mobile working abroad to increase their locational flexibility. Requests are reviewed on a casebycase basis because of the complexity of countryspecific and individual tax social security and labor law issues and the range of operational and activityrelated matters that have to be considered. We use an online advisory tool for this purpose. The new option allows mobile working for up to working days per calendar year within the EU the EEA Switzerland the United Kingdom and Turkey. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.377532635002614,,,,,,
652,The segments and Corporate Headquarters continued to work together on continuous improvements through LeanAgile projects in fiscal year .

This started with five workshops at which more than managers and AI experts discussed and assessed specific ideas for making better use of the potential of AI at thyssenkrupp. In parallel a survey of the AI ecosystem was conducted in all thyssenkrupp segments. This analyzed the status quo and was used to define targets for fiscal year as well as joint areas of action.

762,To determine the taxonomyaligned business activities profiles of the requirements are created for each economic activity on the basis of the delegated acts adopted for the environmental objectives of the EU Taxonomy. The qualitative and quantitative screening criteria are extracted from the delegated acts and translated into documentation requirements for the segments and entities that perform the activities. The profiles also include the documentation requirements resulting from the minimum safeguards pursuant to Article of the EU Taxonomy. The evidence for the business activities that must be considered in the screening procedure for taxonomy alignment in a reporting year is compiled in accordance with these profiles of requirements. This process is managed centrally by a team of experts and representatives of the corporate functions. It is then implemented in cooperation with the thyssenkrupp segments and operating entities that perform the activities. Below is a list of the profiles of requirements for the business activities that were screened for their taxonomy alignment in the reporting period with a positive outcome. It explains the specific screening criteria for each economic activity i.e. the criteria for making a substantial contribution to at least one environmental objective of the EU Taxonomy and special DNSH criteria.

792,The DNSH criteria relating to Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems require the completion of an environmental impact assessment or screening in accordance with Directive EU together with the implementation of the required mitigation and remedial measures resulting from the impact assessment or screening. For activities located in or near biodiversitysensitive areas e.g. the Natura network of protected areas UNESCO World Heritage sites and Key Biodiversity Areas as well as other protected areas an appropriate assessment must be conducted in accordance with Directives EC or EEC and the necessary mitigation measures must have been implemented to avoid negative impacts on the protection objectives of such areas. In the case of activities in third countries these requirements must be implemented on the basis of comparable national laws or international standards requiring the completion of an environmental impact assessment or screening. In the case of business activities that are considered in the screening procedure for taxonomy alignment in a reporting year suitable evidence is obtained for the sites of relevance on the basis of which it can be established that such assessments or screening have been completed and the necessary mitigation measures have been implemented.

794,Article of the EU Taxonomy specifies minimum safeguards that companies are required to fulfill in order to disclose taxonomyaligned turnover capital expenditure and operating expenditure. These require companies to have implemented procedures to ensure compliance with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises including the requirements for responsible business contact in the areas of taxes competition and fighting corruption the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights including the principles and rights set out in the Declaration of the International Labour Organization on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the International Bill of Human Rights. At thyssenkrupp the minimum standards for human and workers rights addressed in the EU Taxonomy and the principles of good corporate governance are embedded in binding corporate policies and regulations such as the Code of Conduct the principles of compliance with human rights and due diligence obligations and the corporate governance statement. Moreover the group has implemented various mechanisms such as the compliance risk management and internal control systems to ensure that these minimum safeguards are met and to take mitigating action where necessary see also the sections Compliance and Forecast opportunity and risk report in this Annual Report.

811,The condition for including taxonomyeligible business activities in EU Taxonomy reporting is that external turnover is generated by a business activity that is consistent with the description of an economic activity in accordance with the delegated acts. If a business activity is allocated to a research and developmentrelated economic activity this must either generate external turnover or be associated with a capital expenditure CapEx andor operating expenditure OpEx. A materiality threshold of million applies in both cases. In the first case it must be satisfied by turnover associated with a business activity and in the second case either by turnover associated with a business activity or by capital expenditure or operating expenditure for this activity. ,0.2859609325240013,,0.4094991182101726,,,,0.4212297748682837,,,0.30866386435000537,,,,0.4486956268593942,0.371800428526833,,,0.2419510167797098,0.41616633507806466
813,Turnover is the main parameter used as the basis for technical screening criteria for assessing the taxonomy alignment of business activities. This applies analogously to capital and operating expenditures associated with these business activities irrespective of their intended purpose. For example on the basis of their intended purpose capital expenditures for a business activity could potentially be allocated to a different economic activity listed in the delegated acts which in turn could involve different screening criteria. This is ruled out by applying the principle that turnover has the priority. In the case of business activities allocated to a research and developmentrelated economic activity on the basis of turnover the technical screening criteria are derived from capital and operating expenditure. ,0.3225749369476181,0.36248473676496235,0.4354505424949765,,0.4121686752006866,,0.4715781498626604,,,0.3519361725109374,0.4451577204894292,,0.3845915397963075,0.540462788296801,0.44101321295618834,,0.2620615805264586,0.26474343499068287,0.4447573091579285

846,The CapEx plan of thyssenkrupp includes capital expenditures intended to allow the taxonomyeligible steel production activities of the thyssenkrupp group to become taxonomyaligned with respect to the environmental objective Climate change mitigation. The purpose of the capital expenditure is the construction and operational capability of a hydrogencapable direct reduction DR plant allowing lowcarbon manufacture of iron and steel by thyssenkrupp. The Executive Board of thyssenkrupp approved the planned capital expenditure on February and the DR plant is scheduled to come into operation by the end of . The taxonomy alignment of the activity associated with operating the plant is likely to be achieved in fiscal year . The capital expenditure disclosed both for the reporting period and for the entire period of the CapEx plan has been reduced by the government grants thyssenkrupp received and receives for this project see Group financial statements Note Property plant and equipment and Note Other nonfinancial assets. Overall a negative CapEx figure resulted for fiscal year because the government grants the figure contains exceeded the acquisition costs incurred in the reporting year. ,,0.38646620754957767,0.4535303263680665,0.3913279850083567,0.4531806372253347,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

896,The nonfinancial statement pursuant to b ff. and b ff. of the German Commercial Code HGB is integrated into the various sections of the management report as this information is important for understanding the business performance and position of the group. In fiscal year thyssenkrupp AG was exempt from the obligation to present a nonfinancial statement as an individual company. The information in the nonfinancial statement nevertheless still applies equally to the group and thyssenkrupp AG. Since the last reporting year we are required to make additional disclosures within the framework of the EU Taxonomy on the taxonomy alignment of our economic activities. These disclosures are part of our nonfinancial statement and are therefore also integrated into the management report. In compiling the nonfinancial statement elements of various frameworks such as the UN Global Compact were used as guidance. Furthermore risks resulting from negative impacts of thyssenkrupps business activities on nonfinancial aspects such as the environment and society are addressed in various sections of the management report. Based on our risk analysis no additional material nonfinancial risks that have to be reported in accordance with c of the German Commercial Code HGB have been identified. The aspects respect for human rights and social issues are addressed as crosscutting issues. Here there are large overlaps both between these issues and with employee issues. Social issues is an important aspect for thyssenkrupp but was not identified as material within the meaning of the nonfinancial statement. Therefore the nonfinancial disclosures on social issues are reported on a voluntary basis. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3462164099452594,,,,

931,In the annual planning process the segments describe bands for instance for their earnings and liquidity targets adjusted EBIT free cash flow before MA in the planning period. In this way they take account of the opportunities and risks of their businesses. The assessment addresses among other things market and technology trends which in some cases remain relevant far beyond the forecast period. In the subsequent monthly reports the segments update the earnings and liquidity projections as well as the corresponding opportunities and risks in the current fiscal year. The graphic Opportunity and risk reporting at thyssenkrupp in the Risks section of this report shows how these elements are integrated into the standard reporting system. Management of our opportunities is a task shared by all relevant decision makers from the Executive Board of thyssenkrupp AG to the segment management boards and the management of the companies through to officers and project leaders with local market responsibility. This structured involvement of numerous experts in decisionmaking processes within the group ensures that opportunities are reliably identified and systematically exploited. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.36122873916065323,0.38093018966498243,,,,,

939,The aim of our plant engineering business is to contribute to the green transformation of industry and help shape it through technological advancements. To this end we are working on research into technologies and innovations that can significantly reduce the greenhouse gases generated in production processes. In this way we aim in particular to enhance and further extend our position as a partner for planning development and services for industrial plants and systems. In the chemical plant engineering business at Uhde there are opportunities above all in the area of green ammonia which is required both as a basic infrastructure element for the hydrogen value chain and for the sustainable production of fertilizers. Further opportunities may result from the ongoing expansion of our highmargin service business. In the Polysius cement engineering business carbon concentration solutions have been integrated successfully into a large number of projects. We see good prospects for establishing this pure oxyfuel technology on the market and thus reducing carbon emissions see also the Technology and innovations section. In addition we want to drive forward our market position in service and automation and see good opportunities for a further increase in the proportion of sales generated by highmargin services. Thanks to our water electrolysis technologies which are assigned to our majority investment thyssenkrupp nucera we see good opportunities to benefit from the strong demand for production processes for green hydrogen. Materials Services In light of the successive transformation of the global economy three trends offer opportunities for our Materials Services segment . the relocation of steps in the value chain to strategic neighboring countries . the need for stronger and more resilient supply chains and . the growing demand for products and solutions that are demonstrably sustainable. We prepared for this early on with our Materials as a Service strategy in order to leverage potential from these trends for our own business. With regard to point . we leverage the advantage that our sites in Europe and North America are already favorably distributed in geographical terms. Intelligent networking of all relevant partners and parameters is a critical success factor for the goal of resilient supply chains. Thanks to our global market access and extensive sector and process knowhow we have enormous flexibility and scope from procurement through processing to supply chain management to manage even complex flows of goods in an intelligent and resourcesaving manner. We are convinced that our innovative approach will enable us to achieve higher profitability and stronger market growth than conventional materials wholesaling. In the light of rising customer requirements supply chain management in particular opens up wideranging opportunities for the segment.

942, The Steel Europe segment is focused on the market for premium flat carbon steel here the development depends to a large extent on the European economy. Due to the persistently challenging market environment the first concept for the planned realignment of the steel business was prepared. Key elements of the existing Strategy have been confirmed for the new organization. They deliver opportunities as a result of systematically aligning the business to attractive future markets and profitable steel grades improving production performance and product quality and achieving climateneutral steel production. Alongside the structural measures aimed at enabling the segment to finance itself in the longterm on the basis of its own earnings power measures from the current performance program are being intensified and implemented to achieve the necessary earnings effects. Target achievement is being support additionally by the APEX performance program in which all corresponding programs are consolidated. Examples include especially efficiency improvements in production operations and in the areas of energy and logistics further cost improvements and procurement successes. Key focus areas of our Strategy such as the implementation of the investment program are judged to be still right and work on these will continue. The extensive new and maintenance investments that have already been implemented provide opportunities for specifically accessing new market potential at the same time supporting costreducing structural measures.

1007,New laws and other changes in the legal framework at national and international level could harbor risks for our business activities if they lead to higher costs or other disadvantages for thyssenkrupp compared with our competitors either directly or with regard to our value chain. Overall the regulatory risks for thyssenkrupp are still classified as medium. In our energyintensive operations we face regulatory risks on the global markets if additional costs are imposed under energy and climaterelated rules which we are unable to pass on to our customers on the international market in full or at all or if there is no longer demand for products and technologies in the long term. thyssenkrupp supports effective climate protection efforts and a sustainable energy transition in which climate protection security of supply and competitiveness are equal priorities. We support the relevant discussion processes on regulatory efforts through close working contacts with the relevant national and international institutions and cooperate with industry associations at all levels to reduce possible risks. Concrete risks in particular for Steel Europe in this connection are described in the section Operational risks of the businesses. ,,,,0.34695565459265404,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1017, For the success of our strategic realignment it is important to have an organization in which the businesses can develop optimally. Therefore portfolio measures and restructuring of existing business activities are possible these are generally associated with execution risks. In addition our strategic businesses are regularly tested for impairment. The risks identified in this category which do not affect the key performance indicators adjusted EBIT and free cash flow before MA and only become visible in net income are currently considered to be high and provisions are recognized in the balance sheet as needed. ,,,,,,,,,,,0.4518759442413759,,,0.394212856050962,,,,,

1030,To manufacture our products we procure raw materials and other starting materials and also require energy. The purchase prices for key products may vary considerably depending on the market situation and could have a significant impact on our cost structures in the future as well. The availability of individual energy sources preproducts and transportation routes for raw materials could be restricted. Disruption to suppliers or transportation capacities could affect our production and jeopardize our ability to meet our contractual obligations to our customers. We consider the individual risks identified in this category to be medium. We counteract procurement risks through marginsecuring measures and alternative procurement sources. The risk of rising energy prices is mitigated by structured energy procurement. In addition in all our businesses we are working to reduce our dependence on gas save energy and reuse residual materials. ,,,,0.35215416100821256,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1031,A strict compliance program guards against the high potential for damage in the event of violation of the regulations.

1032,In case despite this energy or starting products should not be available or not be available on time we have developed businessspecific contingency plans as part of our business continuity management in order to minimize the consequences. Further information on specific procurement risks in our businesses can be found in the section Operational risks of the businesses. We address the risk of human rights and environmentrelated violations in the supply chain which is take up in German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains by undertaking a systematic risk analysis of our suppliers. Suitable preventive measures must be taken if the risk assessment of individual suppliers is elevated. ,,,,0.34304143638922746,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1034, Unfavorable constellations and developments at our sites could expose us to a risk of business interruptions and property damage. In addition to the cost of repairing damage there is above all the risk that a business interruption might result in production losses and thus jeopardize the fulfillment of our contractual obligations towards our customers. We work to counter these risks through regular preventive maintenance measures and through modernization and investment in our machinery and production facilities. In addition we take out appropriate insurance and therefore transfer risks to external service providers. The remaining financial risks in this category are still classified as medium. Accident risks and the related risk of harming people cannot be completely ruled out in the production installation maintenance and use of our products. A safetyoriented corporate culture and the extensive occupational health and safety measures implemented by our occupational safety organization are intended to help minimize the accident risks faced by our employees and subcontractors. In our production plants and during transportation there are processrelated environmental risks relating to air and water pollution. Furthermore some of the groups real estate no longer used for operations is subject to risks from past pollution and mining subsidence. To minimize risks thyssenkrupp invests continuously and sustainably in environmental protection and scheduled remediation and maintains a close dialog with authorities local communities and political representatives. We recognize adequate provisions for dealing with past pollution. Further details on production risks in our businesses can be found in the section Operational risks of the businesses. ,,0.3904846414793203,0.44023157305293026,0.3834274373272355,0.45482502042005407,0.3725353231744848,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1038,Product and process quality and meeting the corresponding quality requirements of our customers have top priority for us. However we cannot rule out the possibility that we will not always be able to meet these quality standards. We still classify the risks arising from this as low and we counter them with extensive measures in connection with production and quality assurance systems. Further details on specific sales risks in our businesses and on our receivables management system which is designed to counter the risk of bad debt are provided in the section Operational risks of the businesses. ,,,0.4110401769161698,,,,0.40392513017318493,,,,,,,,,,,,
1040, Particularly in the plant engineering and marine businesses one of the core challenges is the execution of major contracts involving a high degree of complexity and long project run times. Cost overruns andor delays in individual project phases and differences in the interpretation of contracts cannot be ruled out. We classify individual identified risks in aggregate as low. In the contractual terms and calculations for new orders we endeavor to anticipate possible risks in the project period when the order is placed so that we can respond flexibly to changes in the underlying framework. We continuously improve our management tools so that we have better information on order status at all times and can take projectspecific measures more quickly if required. We check the credit standing of our customers carefully before entering into contracts for major orders and deploy experienced project managers for order execution. Through transparent monitoring of order status we ensure that payments are made promptly on the basis of order progress and minimize payment defaults. ,,,,,,0.41565682147442423,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1042, In the course of executing major investment projects with a long run time cost overruns andor delays in individual project phases and differences in the interpretation of the contracts concluded in connection with the investments cannot be ruled out. We classify individual identified investment risks as medium. When planning major investment projects we seek to anticipate as many risks as possible in the course of the project and take account of these in risk provisions. We establish an investmentrelated risk management process that delivers better information about the current status of the investment project and enables specific measures to be implemented quickly if necessary. As far as possible we also deploy experienced technical and commercial project managers for project execution. Further details on investment risks in connection with the construction of a direct reduction plant for Steel Europe can be found in the section Operational risks of the businesses. ,,,,,,0.40560130569496555,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1044, Our ITbased business processes are exposed to various risks associated with information security which are still classified as medium based on our key performance indicators adjusted EBIT and free cash flow before MA. Human error organizational or technical processes andor security vulnerabilities in information processing can create risks that threaten the confidentiality availability and integrity of information. For this reason we continually review our processes and technologies. Systems are updated and processes modified immediately as necessary. The ITbased integration of our business processes is subject to the condition that the risks involved for our companies and business partners are continuously minimized. This is all the more important when entire value chains are transformed as a result of increasing digitization. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.36299132809929885,,,,,,
1046,The number of attacks on the IT infrastructure of German companies including thyssenkrupp continues to increase. In this connection we have introduced measures to further improve our information security management and security technologies. One focus is protecting our production operations from unauthorized access for the purpose of espionage or sabotage. A group of IT security experts provides crosssegment support in the early identification of risks the number of experts is steadily being increased. In addition the thyssenkrupp Cyber Defense Center regularly verifies the security of the infrastructure and if necessary takes corrective action. Sensitizing our employees to the risks involved in handling businessrelated information is very important. In this context we conduct internal communication and training drives and are working to ensure that the confidentiality of information is ensured through the corresponding technical support. Together with the groups data protection officers and coordinators our experts ensure that personal data are processed in accordance with the rules of the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the applicable local laws. All these measures are intended to protect the groups business data as well as the privacy of our business partners and employees and to respond appropriately to potential new risks. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.4365775644120632,,,,,,
1052,Moreover there are risks relating to the availability of transportation capacities trucks ships containers and infrastructure. We counter these risks through systematic supplier and logistics management taking into account sustainability requirements. With regard to ongoing technological innovations and improvements and the rampup of new plants risks from unplanned earnings impacts cannot be ruled out. Furthermore there is a risk of organizational weaknesses in newly implemented or modified processes. On top of this there are potential risks from unexpected yield and quality problems and the associated warranty and product liability obligations. Moreover operational development in automotive plant engineering is dependent on the efficiency of order processing. Automotive Technology takes measures as part of its production and quality assurance systems to avoid or limit such risks as far as possible. It goes without saying that all our production plants operate in accordance with sustainability requirements. In view of the shift in the automotive industry towards emobility and digitalization Automotive Technology is exposed to the risk of a growing labor and skills shortage. We mitigate this through systematic training and continuing professional development of our employees and employee retention programs. As well as systematic succession planning and talent development models this involves first and foremost training enough young people. We are also continuously improving our attractiveness as an employer in line with changing market conditions. In Germany we have introduced extensive hybrid working models and additional employee benefits. Filling vacancies is supported by our internal groupwide job portal and recruiting processes which we are continuously optimizing to reflect current labor market conditions. Due to changed market conditions and the associated fluctuations in order calloffs the deployment of flexibilization measures and restructuring measures is necessary in some areas of the segment. We use various communication and cultural measures to counter possible impacts on employee motivation. Automotive Technology counters the persistent and intensive IT security threat situation with periodically updated technical and organizational measures as part of the internal Accelerate IT Security program. The goal is to achieve an industryleading level of cybersecurity that enables us to adequately protect our IT against threats from the internet and successfully defend against possible cybersecurity incidents. Extensive certifications in compliance with the TISAX standard Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange which are aligned to the specific requirements of the automotive industry round off the information security measures. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3938327682825019,,,,,,
1054,The plant engineering market is challenging especially because of its volatility. The reasons for this are the differing regulatory approaches e.g. laws guidelines material price trends and central bank interest rate policies which result in customers delaying investment decisions. By contrast the services business is mostly robust. In the plant engineering business risks in connection with the execution of longterm and technically complex orders are countered by professional and resultoriented project management based on standardized processes which may include advice from external consultants the increased use of project management measures and the leveraging of our experience from past projects. Technological risks are associated in particular with a small proportion of first of their kind contracts. ,,,,,,0.4301882993644792,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1060, costs in full to our customers. We use our hedging strategy to address this risk. ,,,,,,,,,0.33674180458070907,,,,,,,,,,
1062, costs especially in the year of the planned startup and the risk of being unable to benefit in full from funding from the German government and the state of North RhineWestphalia. In addition there is a risk associated with the future procurement of green and blue hydrogen and green electricity because deliveries could be linked with the provision of substantial securities to the supplier. If we were unable to provide these securities it might be necessary to operate the direct reduction plant with an energy mix that does not satisfy the secondary criteria for funding which could result in us having to pay penalties or repay funding in accordance with the EUs state aid regulations. We are countering this risk by way of an intensive exchange with the funding provider an active dialog on the political level and a procurement process involving a large number of energy suppliers that has been agreed with the funding provider. A rebudgeting was performed in respect of the costs of constructing the direct reduction plant this identified possible additional costs. The risk management system that has been implemented identifies financial risks in a timely manner and continuously monitors the construction costs. In parallel mitigation measures are identified and initiated. To reduce business interruption risks and improve fire safety funds are made available for ongoing preventive maintenance and for modernization and investment. There are business continuity plans and emergency and crisis plans to deal with possible business interruptions. These set out measures to remedy the damage. The segment has integrated a business and technical risk controlling system for property insurance into its risk management process. The move towards an energy system dominated by renewables in Germany is creating major additional challenges and costs for energyintensive industries in general and the steel sector in particular. For its green transformation the steel industry needs to be able to rely on the availability of sufficient quantities of electricity and hydrogen from renewable resources at competitive prices at all times. We are actively monitoring the current debate on budget regulatory and distribution policy by way of the Federal Network Agency white paper on the development of industry network charges and the white paper formulated by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action on the electricity market of the future. These are of central importance to our energyintensive industry and will substantially affect competitiveness plannability cost distribution the green transformation and the longterm reliability of energy supplies. On the political front we are advocating for competitive electricity prices to safeguard the economic stability and future viability of the industry. Following the adoption of the German governments revised National Hydrogen Strategy there are plans to implement numerous initiatives. For the core H,,,,0.45837047422712396,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For us this means adapting the processes of our energy management system. To implement this we are consulting external advisors and working closely with the responsible certification bodies. If our measures are not recognized by the relevant authorities there is a risk that we could lose any funding that we have already received. ,,,,0.3460686625696567,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1107,The first line concerns activities including risk management and the use of resources taking into consideration external and internal regulations. The aim is to avoid or identify and mitigate risks where they may arise i.e. at the operational level within the businesses. To this end the local risk and control officers apply specific risk management and compliance measures and implement the requirements of the internal control system. All employees in the first line are required to take a responsible and riskaware approach within their area of competence in compliance with the law and binding internal regulations issued by thyssenkrupp to ensure that risks are managed appropriately. Constant dialog is maintained with the Executive Board of thyssenkrupp AG through the management level at the segments on planned actual and expected outcomes related to the targets of the organization and on risks. The second line structures governance for the thyssenkrupp group and defines corresponding minimum requirements for systems and processes for use by the first line. It sets the framework for collaboration within the thyssenkrupp group and defines groupwide requirements for the structure of the internal control system the risk management system and compliance for example through binding internal regulations. The specific features of governance are riskoriented and decided at the discretion of the Executive Board. Management responsibility for achieving the organizational objectives covers the design of both first and secondline roles. Close integration of the internal control system risk management system and compliance aims to maximize the efficiency of risk prevention and management. ,,,,0.38045244221662977,,,,,,,,,0.3624891999152303,,,,,,

1131,The Supervisory Board has formed a total of six committees. With the exception of the Nomination Committee all committees must be composed of equal numbers of shareholder and employee representatives. The Mediation Committee formed in accordance with of the Codetermination Act MitbestG must be composed of the Supervisory Board Chair the Deputy Chair one shareholder representative and one employee representative. In line with the recommendation of the GCGC the chair of the Supervisory Board and the chair of Audit Committee are not the same person. The Executive Committee and the Personnel Committee are composed of the same four members namely Prof. Dr.Ing. Dr.Ing. E. h. Siegfried Russwurm chair of both committees Dr. Bernhard Günther Jürgen Kerner and Tekin Nasikkol. As part of its activities the Personnel Committee handles the topic of succession planning which the chair of the Supervisory Board also discusses with the Executive Board.

1145,For the Supervisory Board of thyssenkrupp AG the law stipulates that the board must be composed of at least women and at least men. The minimum for the proportion of women members as required by law and defined by the Supervisory Board has been exceeded since fiscal year . As of September the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board and the employee representatives each included four female members so the proportion of women on the Supervisory Board was . In May regarding the percentage of women on the Executive Board of thyssenkrupp AG the Supervisory Board set a target of one woman and based on an Executive Board of three members. If the size of the Executive Board were to be increased or decreased within the period until June defined for achieving the target the percentage represented by one female Executive Board member will apply. In June the Executive Board of thyssenkrupp AG raised the female representation target for the first management level below the Executive Board to five women and for the second level to women to be implemented in both cases by June . Other companies in the thyssenkrupp group subject to codetermination law have also adopted targets for the proportion of women on supervisory boards management boards and at two management levels below set a deadline for implementation and published both in accordance with statutory provisions. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.2969228261511639,,,
1148,The diversity model is aimed at securing sufficient diversity of opinion and knowledge on the Executive Board. The assessment selection and appointment of candidates is based on the rules and generally accepted principles of nondiscrimination. In selecting candidates for the Executive Board the Supervisory Board also considers further diversity criteria the candidates personality expertise and experience internationality training and professional background as well as age and gender. The weighting given to the diversity criteria depends on the Executive Board position and duties to be performed in each individual case. The Personnel Committee of the Supervisory Board takes the above criteria into account when selecting candidates for the Executive Board. The diversity model for the composition of the Executive Board was fulfilled in the reporting period. In particular the Executive Board members have many years of experience in their respective areas of responsibility. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3142633548457641,,,
1150,The diversity model for the Supervisory Board aims to ensure that the members of the Supervisory Board have the knowledge skills and professional experience needed to perform their tasks properly. thyssenkrupp AG follows the statutory requirements when setting the target for the percentage of women on the Supervisory Board. They stipulate that at least of the members must be women and at least men. In addition the diversity model comprises two key elements the targets of the Supervisory Board for its own composition and the competency profile for the Supervisory Board as a whole. Both already contain requirements for the Supervisory Boards diversity model for example age gender education and professional background. The diversity model is implemented through the election of Supervisory Board members. The election recommendations made to the Annual General Meeting of thyssenkrupp AG must meet the statutory requirements for the representation of women and men on the Supervisory Board while taking into account the targets set by the Supervisory Board itself and aiming to fulfill the competency profile for the board as a whole. This also applies to the appointment of successor candidates to the Supervisory Board. The Nomination Committee takes the diversity model into account when seeking candidates to act as shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3040584845643649,,,

1220,Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Capitalized production costs for selfconstructed assets include costs of material direct labor and allocable material and manufacturing overhead. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the production of assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use. Administrative costs are capitalized only if such costs are directly related to production. Maintenance and repair costs daytoday servicing are expensed as incurred. The group recognizes in the carrying amount of an item of property plant and equipment the cost of replacing parts and major inspection of such an item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Where fixtures and equipment comprise of significant parts having different useful lives those parts are depreciated separately.

1230,The group as a lessee recognizes in general for all leases within the statement of financial position an asset for the right of use of the leased assets and a liability for the lease payment commitments at present value. These are primarily rentals of property and buildings technical equipment and machinery other plants and operating and office equipment. The right of use assets reported under property plant and equipment are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Payments for nonlease components are not included in the determination of the lease liability. The lease liabilities reported under financial liabilities reflect the present value of the outstanding lease payments at the time the asset is made available for use. Lease payments are discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease if it can be readily determined. Otherwise they are discounted at the lessees incremental borrowing rate. The derivation of the interest rate is based on the assumption that an adequate amount of funds will be raised over an adequate period of time taking into account the respective currency area and a discount for the collateralization of the underlying asset. ,,,,0.35358075310100917,,0.34378942036375676,,,0.3806614810577702,,,0.48771408769989255,,,,,,,
1231,The lease liabilities include the following lease payments over the respective lease term Fixed payments less lease incentives to be paid by the lessor variable lease payments that are based on an index or an interest rate expected amounts to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees the exercise price of a purchase option if the exercise is reasonably certain and payment of penalties for the termination of the lease if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease. Rightofuse assets are measured at cost which are comprised as follows Lease liability lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received initial direct costs and dismantling obligations. Subsequent measurement is performed at amortized cost. Rightofuse assets are depreciated on a straightline basis over the lease term unless the useful life of the underlying asset is shorter. If the lease agreement contains reasonably certain purchase options the right of use is depreciated over the economic life of the underlying asset. In subsequent measurement the lease liability is compounded and the corresponding interest expense is recognized in the financial incomeexpense net. The lease payments made reduce the carrying amount of the lease liability. In accordance with the recognition exemptions shortterm leases less than twelve months and lowvalue leases are recognized in the statement of income. thyssenkrupp has identified certain asset classes e.g. PCs telephones printers copiers which regularly contain leased assets of low value. Outside these asset classes only leased assets with a value of up to are classified as lowvalue leased assets. Furthermore the regulations are not applied to leases of intangible assets. For contracts comprising a nonlease component as well as a lease component each lease component must be accounted for separately from nonlease component as a lease. The lessee must allocate the contractually agreedupon payment to the separate lease components based on the relative standalone selling price of the lease component and the aggregated standalone selling price of the nonlease components. In addition intragroup leases will continue to be presented in the segment report according to IFRS as intercompany expenses or income. The term of the lease is determined based on the noncancellable lease term. Especially real estate leases contain extension and termination options. Such contractual conditions offer the greatest possible operational flexibility to the group. In determining the lease term all facts and circumstances are considered that provide an economic incentive to exercise renewal options or not to exercise termination options. Lease term modifications from the exercise or nonexercise of such options are only considered in the lease term if they are reasonably certain and are based on an event that is within the control of the lessee. ,,,,0.40457925967002556,0.38494420289118325,0.4204900988168825,0.4393291370643515,0.36654051368550483,,0.3530996296316767,,0.4148452919183358,,,,,,,

1238,A financial instrument is any contract that at the same time gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial instruments are recognized as soon as thyssenkrupp becomes a contracting party to the financial instrument. In cases where trade date and settlement date do not coincide for nonderivative financial instruments the settlement date is used for initial recognition or derecognition while for derivatives the trade date is used. Financial instruments stated as financial assets or financial liabilities are generally not offset they are only offset when a legal right to setoff exists at that time and settlement on a net basis is intended.,,,,,,,,,,,0.4791137639202505,,,,,,,,

1240,In particular financial assets include trade accounts receivable cash and cash equivalents derivative financial assets as well as equity and debt instruments. Trade accounts receivable are initially measured at the transaction price other financial assets are initially recognized at fair value. This includes any transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets which are not carried at fair value through profit or loss in future periods. The fair values recognized on the balance sheet usually reflect the market prices of the financial assets. The classification and measurement of financial assets is based on the financial assets cash flow characteristics and on thyssenkrupps business model for managing the financial assets. Different business models may apply for separate portfolios of identical debt instruments e.g. where factoring programs exist for certain trade accounts receivable. If a debt instrument is held with the objective of collecting contractual cash flows and if the cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest the instrument is recognized at amortized cost. At thyssenkrupp this mainly concerns trade accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents without money market funds as well as the interestfree loans resulting from the Elevator investment see Note . Money market funds are measured at fair value through profit or loss. If the cash flow conditions are met but the debt instrument is held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell the instrument is measured at fair value in equity with recycling. At thyssenkrupp this mainly concerns trade accounts receivable which may be sold and securities. For equity instruments not held for trading with the exemption of the preference shares of the Elevator investment thyssenkrupp has consistently exercised the option to recognize future changes in fair value in profit or loss. However changes in fair value of the preference shares are directly recognized in equity without recycling. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are also recognized at fair value in profit or loss. ,,,,,0.3764314526507092,,,0.37554588201445377,,,0.504130067366451,,,,,,,,
1241,Debt instruments lease receivables trade accounts receivable and contract assets recognized at amortized cost or at fair value in equity are measured according to the expected loss model. Using forwardlooking information the expected credit loss is generally calculated by multiplying the three parameters carrying value of the financial asset probability of default and loss given default. thyssenkrupp applies the simplified impairment model under IFRS and reports lifetime expected losses for all trade accounts receivable and contract assets. For all other financial assets twelvemonth expected credit losses are reported. Owing to the short maturities these generally correspond to lifetime expected losses at thyssenkrupp with the exemption of the noncurrent loans of the Elevator investment. thyssenkrupp has developed a model to determine the expected credit loss in particular to determine the expected default rates for trade accounts receivable. The expected default rates are determined mainly on the basis of external credit information and ratings for each counterparty. If no rating information is available at counterparty level an assessment is made based on the average probability of default for each segment plus an appropriate risk premium. thyssenkrupp regards the assumption that the risk of default has increased significantly if the payment is overdue by more than days as refuted. It also shows that there is no default if the payment is overdue for days. Moreover financial assets are fully or partially impaired on the basis of defaults if it is reasonable to assume that they can no longer be fully realized e.g. because the due date has long passed or owing to insolvency or similar proceedings. Receivables that do not bear interest or bear below market interest rates and have an expected term of more than one year are discounted with the discount subsequently amortized to interest income over the term of the receivable. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand demand deposits and time deposits as well as financial assets that are readily convertible to cash and which are only subject to an insignificant risk of change in value as well as current money market funds with a maximum term of three months. Cash and cash equivalents without money market funds are measured at amortized cost money market funds at fair value through profit or loss. ,,,,0.3490035930288079,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1242,Financial liabilities ,,,,,,,,,,,0.557418380654619,,,,,,,,
1243,Financial liabilities are liabilities that must be settled in cash or other financial assets. Financial liabilities are initially carried at fair value. This includes any transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial liabilities which are not carried at fair value through profit or loss in future periods. ,,,,,,,,,,,0.47212389706555113,,,,,,,,

1247,Derivative financial instruments mainly foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swaps and commodity forward contracts are used generally to reduce the currency interest rate and commodity price risk. Such derivatives and socalled embedded derivatives which are an integral part of certain contracts and must be accounted for separately are measured initially and subsequently at fair value. If the fair value is positive they are recognized as financial assets otherwise as financial liabilities. If they do not qualify for hedge accounting they are recognized at fair value in profit or loss and gains or losses due to fluctuations in fair value are recognized immediately in profit or loss. ,0.2998948484529654,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.24937414457286589,
1248,Hedging relationships are mainly used to hedge foreign currency risks of firm commitments future receivables and liabilities denominated in foreign currency commodity price risks arising from sales and purchase transactions and interest rate and foreign currency risks from noncurrent financings. In the case of cash flow hedges the fluctuations in fair value are divided into an effective and an ineffective portion. The effective portion of fluctuations in fair value is recognized initially directly in equity within cumulative other comprehensive income. thyssenkrupp uses the option of separately reporting hedging costs forward element and currency basis spread in connection with designated foreign currency derivatives in other comprehensive income. Reclassification to profit or loss takes place when the hedged item affects profit or loss. The ineffective portion of fluctuations in fair value is recognized directly in profit or loss. Fair value hedges are mainly used to hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of a firm commitment and exposure to inventory price risks as well as to hedge interest rate risks. In addition to the fluctuations in fair value of the derivative the offsetting fluctuations in the fair value of the hedged item are also recognized in profit or loss insofar as they relate to the hedged risk. The presentation of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments in the statement of income follows the presentation of the hedged items. For foreign currency or commodity forward contracts used to hedge sales risks they are presented under net sales. For hedging instruments used to hedge procurement risks they are presented under cost of sales and for hedging instruments used to hedge financing risks they are presented under financial incomeexpense.

1255,The groups net obligation for defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plans have been calculated for each plan using the projected unit credit method as of the balance sheet date. A quarterly valuation of pensions is performed on the basis of updated interest rates and fair values of plan assets. As far as the fair value of plan assets related to pensions or similar obligations exceeds the corresponding obligation the recognition of an asset in respect to such surplus is limited. As far as in connection with plan assets minimum funding requirements related to past service exist an additional liability may need to be recognized in case the economic benefit of a surplus already taking into account the contributions to be made in respect of the minimum funding requirements is limited. The limit is determined by the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan asset asset ceiling. With the exception of net interest all income and expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in incomeloss from operations. Net interest included in net periodic pension cost is recognized in net financial incomeexpense in the groups statement of income. The groups obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as expense in incomeloss from operations as incurred. The effects of remeasurements of pensions and similar obligations are recognized in other comprehensive income and reported in retained earnings. They consist of actuarial gains and losses the return on plan assets and changes in the effects of asset ceiling excluding amounts already included in net interest. Deferred taxes relating to remeasurements are also recognized in other comprehensive income. The group also maintains multiemployer plans. In principle these multiemployer plans contain defined benefit plans as well as defined contribution plans. With respect to defined benefit multiemployer plans these are accounted for in the same way as any other defined benefit plan in case the required information is available. Otherwise these plans are accounted for as defined contribution plans. In particular in the Netherlands there exist multiemployer defined benefit plans that are accounted for as defined contribution plans due to the fact that the pension obligations and the plan assets cannot be assigned to the participating employers. ,,,,,,,,,,,0.48081595705121655,,,,0.36039938238354713,0.31369158732984825,0.2724731849893151,,

1257,Provisions are recognized when the group has a present obligation as a result of a past event which will result in a probable outflow of economic benefits that can be reasonably estimated. The amount recognized represents best estimate of the settlement amount of the present obligation as of the balance sheet date. Expected reimbursements of third parties are not offset but recorded as a separate asset if it is virtually certain that the reimbursements will be received.

The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities. For construction contracts the provision is recognized in line with the performance progress according to the percentage of completion i.e. pro rata over the period of fulfillment. Provisions for restructuring costs are recognized when the group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has notified the affected parties. A provision for onerous contracts is recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. Before a separate provision is recognized the assets associated with the contract are impaired.,,,,0.37299327705630747,,0.4489236300478287,0.45698997018887777,0.39427416889736383,0.39844686509502897,0.322976049223803,,0.40748401299334885,,,0.35469281941792474,,0.27230619634762576,,0.40551670615647695
1262,Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when the included distinct performance obligations i.e. the distinct goods or services promised in the contract are transferred to the customer. Transfer takes place when the customer obtains control of the promised goods or services. This is generally the case when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the transferred goods or services. Revenue from contracts with customers corresponds to the transaction price. The transaction price includes variable consideration only to the extent it is highly probable that actual occurrence of the variable consideration will not result in a significant revenue reversal. Variable consideration can include for example volume discounts delay penalties early completion incentives or credits in connection with bonus agreements. The transaction price is not adjusted for a financing component mainly because the period between the transfer of goods and services and the date of payment by the customer is generally less than twelve months. Where a contract with a customer has multiple distinct performance obligations the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations by reference to their relative standalone selling prices. The standalone selling prices are determined on the basis of directly observable market prices or using recognized estimation methods. If distinct performance obligations are satisfied acting as an agent the revenue recognized is not the gross amount payable by the customer but only the net amount retained as a commissionlike fee for the respective performance obligation. ,,,,,,,0.4633014919354502,0.4065482943970686,0.3911838027086292,,,0.36662716685407476,,0.4114135240049764,,,,,
1263,Revenue from the sale of goods and commodities is recognized at the point in time at which control is transferred to the customer. The time of transfer of control is determined partly on the basis of the delivery clauses agreed with the customer. In the case of goods and commodities supplied under consignment arrangements sales revenue is generally recognized when the corresponding goods are removed from consignment by the customer. Sales revenue from contracts with customers in the plant construction business is recognized over time based on the stage of completion. The stage of completion is as a rule determined by the ratio of contract costs incurred up to the reporting date to the total estimated contract costs as of the reporting date costtocostmethod. Contract losses are recognized as expense immediately and reported in the statement of financial position under other provisions. The recognition of revenue over time for the performance of services is generally carried out through linear allocation of the transaction price over the service performance period. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer are capitalized under noncurrent nonfinancial assets only if they relate to contracts with an original expected duration of more than months. They are amortized by the straightline method over the term of the contract. If the performance obligations fulfilled for the customer exceed the payments received or due from the customer contract assets are recognized in the statement of financial position on a net basis insofar as the right to receive payment from the customer is still conditional. Unconditional rights to receive payment are recognized under trade accounts receivable and from this point payment automatically becomes due with the passage of time. If the payments received or due from the customer exceed the performance obligations fulfilled contract liabilities are recognized in the statement of financial position on a net basis. ,0.30241395874259414,,,0.4024829478530588,0.4210233547978667,0.4701581675098098,0.4943043710037032,0.4376790117930766,0.3471110813728274,,,0.3445601101613455,,0.3810181970757594,,,,,

1273,A single noncurrent asset is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. The group reports assets and liabilities as a disposal group that will be disposed of by sale or otherwise in a single transaction which collectively meet the held for sale criteria as specified in IFRS Noncurrent Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. The group reports the assets and liabilities of a disposal group separately in the balance sheet line item assets held for saledisposal and liabilities associated with assets held for saledisposal respectively. Unless a disposal group qualifies for discontinued operations reporting the revenues and expenses of the disposal group remain within continuing operations until the date of disposal. The group reports the results of a disposal group that also qualifies as a separate component of the group as discontinued operations if it represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations. The group reports the results of discontinued operations in the period in which they occur separately within the consolidated statement of income as discontinued operations net of tax. All prior period consolidated statements of income are adjusted to report the results of the component within discontinued operations. In the consolidated statement of cash flows the cash flows resulting from discontinued operations are presented separately from cash flows resulting from continuing operations prior year presentation has been adjusted accordingly. On initial classification as held for sale noncurrent assets and disposal groups are recognized at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal and depreciation and amortization ceases. Immediately before this a noncurrent asset or disposal group is initially measured in line with the respective IFRS standards to determine the carrying amount which is then compared to the fair value less costs of disposal of the group in order to recognize the group at the lower of both amounts. Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale are included in profit or loss as are gains and losses on subsequent remeasurement but not in excess of the cumulative impairment loss.,,,,,0.4731088925190444,,0.45798599035504534,,,0.3277757236426855,0.4486250563119969,0.35514332381069436,,0.4375316316136758,,,,0.23781692040461955,0.42184312473144475

1285,Certain group companies particularly in the Marine Systems and Decarbon Technologies segments report some of their business transactions as construction contracts in which revenue is recognized over time based on the percentage of completion. Revenue is presented here according to the percentage of completion. The percentage of completion is as a rule determined by the ratio of contract costs incurred up to the reporting date to the total estimated contract costs as of the reporting date costtocostmethod. This method requires accurate estimates of the extent of progress towards completion. Depending on the methodology to determine contract progress the significant estimates include total contract costs remaining costs to completion total contract revenues contract risks and other judgments. The managements of the operating companies continually review all estimates involved in such contraction contracts and adjust them as necessary. The expected variable consideration amount is estimated at the inception of a contract with a customer. The estimate is made using either the probabilityweighted expected value or the most likely amount. The estimation method giving the better forecast for the respective contract is always used. The variable consideration amount estimated at contract inception is reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted as necessary. ,,,,,,0.4755173119338789,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1371,In the st quarter ended December the Steel Europe segment had to recognize impairment losses mainly due to the increased cost of capital. Applying a discount rate after tax of . for future cash flows the relevant value in use was million. The resulting impairment loss recognized by Steel Europe amounts to million. Thereof million relates to technical machinery and equipment million to construction in progress million to buildings million to land million to other equipment factory and office equipment million to development costs and million to other intangible assets. Impairment losses of million were recorded in the cost of sales million in general and administrative expenses million in selling expenses and million in research and development cost. The underlying value in use is based on the assumptions current at that time for the course of business until taking into account the effects of the initiated green transformation. A simplified extrapolation is then carried out until . In the th quarter ended September a renewed impairment test was conducted in the Steel Europe segment which resulted in the recognition of an impairment loss. To determine the recoverable amount of the segment or the cash generating unit Steel Europe the fair value less costs of disposal was calculated. Due to the pending divestment the assets and liabilities for highquality grainoriented electrical steel in India were classified as held for sale as of the reporting date and were thus no longer included in the valuation of the Steel Europe segment see Note . The fair value less costs of disposal was determined on the basis of income level of the fair value hierarchy a weighted average cost of capital after tax of . was applied to discount the future cash flows. On the basis of the fair value less costs of disposal of million impairment losses of million were recognized on assets. The underlying cash flows are based on current assumptions for business development until taking account of the effects of the announced adjustment of the production network and the effects of the green transformation that has been initiated. This is followed by a simplified projection up to taking into account a growth rate based on inflation expectations of . The very gloomy economic situation especially in the core sales market of Germany the structural challenges in the German automotive industry as a key customer segment and the high degree of uncertainty especially due to the ongoing negative effects of the Ukraine war and the continuing cyclical weakness of the global economy were explicitly included in the sustainable shipment and margin expectations with corresponding risk discounts in the cash flows. These factors and circumstances in combination with the persistently high costs of energy and capital and the significant investments expected in the course of business especially in respect of the green transformation resulted in further impairment losses. In connection with the green transformation the economic effects expected from the ongoing construction of the first direct reduction plant and the current and expected future legal and economic conditions e.g. trading in CO,,,0.4043403011244287,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the nd quarter ended March the Automotive Body Solutions business unit of the Automotive Technology segment had to recognize impairment losses totaling million in cost of sales. Thereof million relate to technical machinery and equipment and million to other equipment factory and office equipment. The reasons for this were lower earnings expectations due to a reduction in customer offtake of orders and delays to new projects. The recoverable amount relevant for determining the respective impairment loss is the value in use for which a discount rate after tax of . was applied. The value in use amounts to a total of million. In the rd quarter ended June the Steering business unit of the Automotive Technology segment recognized impairment reversals in cost of sales of million in the electric steering Steering Gear product area and of million in the electromechanical steering assistance Column EPS product area. The main reason for this was the reduced cost of capital compared with the previous quarter. In the case of the Steering Gear product area the recoverable amount relevant for determining the impairment reversal is the value in use for which a discount rate after tax of . was applied and which amounts to a total of million. Also in the case of the Column EPS product area the recoverable amount relevant for determining the impairment reversal is the value in use which amounts to a total of million and for which a discount rate after tax of . was applied.

1385, allowances an increasing share of energy costs in steel production and thus higher production costs overall together with the ability to enforce higher steel prices in Europe under the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism CBAM and ultimately adequate availability of hydrogen at the production sites. Developments that would necessitate further impairment losses to carrying amounts in the Steel Europe segment in the next fiscal year cannot be ruled out. Of the impairment loss of million million relates to technical machinery and equipment million to construction in progress million to buildings million to land million to other equipment factory and office equipment million to development costs and million to other intangible assets. Further an impairment loss of million was identified on corporate assets allocated to Special Units. The impairment loss of million on assets used jointly in the thyssenkrupp group corporate assets was recognized in Special Units. For impairment testing purposes these assets are allocated proportionately to the cashgenerating units because they do not generate any separate cash flows. The impairment loss reflects the reduced recoverability of the corporate assets in particular in the Steel Europe cashgenerating unit because of the impairment losses recognized there in the th quarter ended September . In addition in the Automotive Technology segment impairment losses were identified in the Steering Bilstein and Automotive Body Solutions business units in a renewed impairment test in the th quarter ended September . In the Steering business unit further impairment losses of million were recognized on technical equipment and machinery in the global electric steering gear product area these were mainly due to the reduced earnings expectations as a result of the deterioration in the economic situation.

In this case too the tkVA is no longer a relevant performance criterion starting with the th installment issued in fiscal year . The amount of the payout is calculated by multiplying the adjusted number of stock rights by the average price of thyssenkrupp shares in the exchange trading days before the end of the fouryear performance period. The LTI plan design for the Executive Board applies to the eligible executives at Corporate Headquarters and in the former Multi Tracks segment. In the case of Multi Tracks there is also a discretionary factor that the Executive Board can use to increase or decrease the number of stock rights by up to in order to additionally reflect the specific performance of the segment on the basis of the three aggregated performance criteria described above. The discretionary factor is not based on any predefined criteria but only serves as an adjustment ex post if after the tranche has expired the Executive Board taking into account the overall circumstances comes to the conclusion that taking over Executive Boards achievement of objectives by the participating Multi Tracks managers would lead to inappropriate results. Accordingly the factor is normally .. Starting with the th installment of the incentive plan issued in the fiscal year the plan design was adjusted again the Executive Boards plan design with the corresponding performance criteria at Group level applies to all other eligible executives regardless of their segment affiliation. There is no obligation for the other executives eligible to participate in the LTI equivalent to the Executive Board obligation to purchase and hold thyssenkrupp shares. To determine the fair value of the cashsettled stock rights used to calculate the prorata liability as of the balance sheet date forward prices of the thyssenkrupp stock are calculated taking into account the existing caps. The forward calculation is carried out for predefined periods averaging periods taking into account the thyssenkrupp stock price and the euro interest rate curve as of the balance sheet date and the dividends assumed to be paid until the maturity of the stock rights. The following parameters were included in the calculation ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.29150881173872933,,,

Also in fiscal year the th installment of the LTI was granted to the Executive Board and additional executive employees. In total in fiscal year the group recorded an income of million from cashsettled sharebased compensation prior year million expense and an expense of million from sharebased compensation settled with thyssenkrupp shares prior year million income. The liability arising from the LTI amounts to million as of September prior year million. Additionally million prior year million is reported in equity as of September for the sharebased compensation of the members of the Executive Board. The background to the recognition in equity is that all Executive Board members are required to purchase thyssenkrupp shares equivalent to a total value of one annual fixed salary gross and to hold them for the duration of their appointment. This is a sharebased compensation settled with thyssenkrupp shares. Starting in fiscal year the minimum annual investment is of the net payout from the performancerelated compensation components until the prescribed investment amount is reached. In addition to the LTI described above the performancerelated compensation components also include a shortterm incentive STI which is based on the performance indicators of net income and free cash flow before MA at group level as well as the individual performance of the members of the Executive Board the associated performance period in each case covers one fiscal year. Fulfillment of the share buy and hold requirement is determined based on the purchase price at the acquisition date. See also the disclosures on the compensation of the current Executive Board members in Note . In fiscal year thyssenkrupp AGs Executive Board members were granted stock rights in the th installment of the LTI the breakdown of which is shown below. Due to the fact that one member of the Executive Board will no longer be a member of the Executive Board at the time of payment of this tranche modification in accordance with IFRS and one member of the Executive Board has already fulfilled the share purchase obligation the compensation for these two Executive Board members will be paid entirely in cash. This means that it is no longer shown in equity but rather in provisions. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.2923688688449517,,,

1647,Credit risk default risk is the risk of thyssenkrupp incurring financial losses due to the nonfulfillment or partial fulfillment of existing debt obligations. Credit risk management is governed by corporate guidelines. Segments and group companies are required to implement credit risk management in accordance with these guidelines. In order to minimize default risks credit risks from the use of financial instruments such transactions are only concluded with counterparties that meet our internal minimum requirements. Credit risk management defines minimum requirements for the selection of counterparties so that financial instruments in the financing area are only concluded with counterparties who have a good credit rating or are members of a deposit protection fund. Creditworthiness is monitored on the basis of assessments by recognized rating agencies and also taking into account shortterm early warning indicators. Continuous and standardized monitoring of ratings and early warning indicators enables us to minimize risks at an early stage. Derivative financial instruments are generally entered into on the basis of standard contracts in which it is possible to net open transactions with the respective business partners. Default risks are generally hedged with suitable instruments. These include in particular private and state credit insurance as well as letters of credit and guarantees from banks insurance companies and management companies. In the case of longterm contracts additional security is provided in the form of advance payments received. In order to further minimize default risks from operating activities the corporate guidelines provide for the assessment of default risk based on the risk profile of the business partner using suitable internal and where available external information such as ratings and credit reports. Credit limits are set for each business partner using this credit rating. The assessment of the risk profile is subject to appropriate ongoing monitoring which enables thyssenkrupp to minimize risk at an early stage. Taking into account the individual characteristics of their customer structures and business models the respective business areas lay down clear process rules for determining which measures are to be taken in the event of deteriorating creditworthiness or payment default in order to mitigate the maximum default risk as far as possible. Transactions whose value exceeds specified materiality thresholds especially in the area of major projects also require prior approval at thyssenkrupp AG level. Among other things the amount and hedging of default risks is assessed. ,,,,0.34250623743764247,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1821,Possible future lease payments by the lessee arising from the exercise of options were not included in the lease liability if the exercise of the respective options was not considered reasonably certain. These options include lease payments from lease extension options penalties from the exercise of termination options and payments from purchase options. Only if there is a high probability that the options will be exercised are they considered to be exercisable and recognized as lease liabilities. If facts and circumstances change a reassessment of the exercise of the options is undertaken. If infinitely revolving lease extension options exist for leasehold contracts in individual cases or automatically prolonging lease contracts their payments are not included in the possible future lease payments. An estimate of the term was made when determining the corresponding lease liability. Individual leases can contain several options. The thyssenkrupp group uses options to achieve the greatest possible operating flexibility. Such options can generally only be exercised by the thyssenkrupp group as lessee. In addition the leases do not contain any clauses that significantly restrict the group by requiring it to meet certain commitments. ,,,,,,,,,0.34624780983181735,,,0.3573811198280848,,,,,,,

Moreover in fiscal year the Executive Board members were awarded individual compensation within the meaning of AktG which in previous fiscal years had been promised under the compensation system in effect at that time. Where relevant this compensation is also outlined and explained in the following. The Personnel Committee regularly reviews the appropriateness and commensurateness of Executive Board compensation and proposes adjustments to the Supervisory Board where required to ensure within the boundaries of the applicable framework that the compensation package for Executive Board members is both in line with the market and competitive. The appropriateness of the compensation was last reviewed with the support of an independent external compensation expert in August .

1948,In addition to their fixed compensation the Executive Board members receive fringe benefits which as part of the total compensation are also capped by the maximum compensation. The standard fringe benefits for Executive Board members in the form of benefits in kind and similar benefits include a car and driver for business and private use security services insurance premiums and health checks. In principle all Executive Board members are equally entitled to these fringe benefits the amount varies according to their personal situation. Moreover the Supervisory Board may grant newly appointed Executive Board members equalization payments for compensation entitlements lost due to their switch to thyssenkrupp relocation costs and other benefits for a limited period such as the reimbursement of costs in connection with the need to maintain two households for work purposes. In this context due to the assumption of his position on the Executive Board at a short notice for Miguel ngel Lpez Borrego the company paid reasonable expenses including the related taxes for a hotel room in Essen or the surrounding area for the period from the start of his appointment until May . Due to the need to maintain two households for work purposes the company will also pay Dr. Jens Schulte appropriate costs for hotel accommodation or for an apartment in or close to Essen for a transitional period until May at the latest. Dr. Jens Schulte will also receive an equalization payment for compensation entitlements from his previous employer which he lost due to his switch to thyssenkrupp in the form of a signon bonus of gross payable in three installments of each with his compensation for September and . ,,,,,,,,,0.41828785024095805,,,,,,,,,,
1952,It was also agreed with Dr. Klaus Keysberg that the pension entitlement acquired in the course of his previous duties in the group will continue unchanged in accordance with the rules of the pension scheme C of the Essener Verband pension association hereinafter pension scheme C entitlement. Dr. Klaus Keysberg will therefore receive a lifelong annuity when he reaches retirement age or if he should become permanently incapacitated for work. As an Executive Board member first appointed with effect from February Oliver Burkhard has in previous years been promised benefits from a company pension scheme on the basis of a definedcontribution arrangement which will likewise be paid out to him as a lifelong annuity once he has reached retirement age or becomes permanently incapacitated for work. The amount of the later annuity is determined by the annual pension modules accrued and therefore grows gradually over the period of service. The agreed maximum annuity of p.a. was reached in as a result of which no further regular provisions have since been recognized for increases in this entitlement. The retirement age is in the case of Oliver Burkhard provided he no longer has a service contract with the company at that time. Since the service contract with Dr. Klaus Keysberg was not extended beyond July and thus not beyond the age of Dr. Klaus Keysberg could claim his annuity from August . In the case of Oliver Burkhard pension payments will be increased by per year and in the case of Dr. Klaus Keysbergs pension scheme C entitlement they will be reviewed by the Essener Verband pension association and adjusted in line with altered circumstances where necessary. In the case of annuity entitlements the surviving dependents benefits plan provides for a payment of of the pension for the spouse or life partner and for each dependent child up to a maximum of of the regular pension entitlement. As of September the amounts expensed or recognized as provisions and the present values of the pension entitlements for Oliver Burkhard as the only active Executive Board member with a retirement benefit are as follows ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.31022240796538947,,,
1959,The STI is the shortterm variable compensation element it has a term of one year. of the STI amount depends on the performance of two equally weighted key financial performance indicators of the group net income for the fiscal year and free cash flow before MA and on individual performance targets.

1992,As in the compensation reports for the years since in the disclosures on STI in this compensation report the compensation awarded or due in the fiscal year disclosed in accordance with AktG is not based on the amount paid in the reporting year for the previous fiscal year instead the compensation for which the underlying activity was performed in full in the reporting period is disclosed. Accordingly in the interests of a more accurate allocation to the period the STI is disclosed as part of the compensation awarded or due in fiscal year even though payment is only made in December and thus in the following fiscal year . The aim of this method of presentation is to enhance the clarity and comprehensibility of the compensation report and is in line with the market practice on the interpretation of the term awarded or due pursuant to AktG. ,,,,,,,,,0.3598094506276835,,,,,,,0.3230784823073291,,,
1998,The second performancerelated compensation element is the LongTerm Incentive LTI which has a performance period of four years. The LTI is sharebased this brings the interests of the Executive Board and those of shareholders even better into line. The LTI is issued in annual installments. Before the new installment is issued the Supervisory Board sets challenging target and threshold values for the following three additively linked performance criteria to the extent that these do not result directly from the compensation system in effect ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.29608547942232216,,,
2032,Like the other sustainability targets the HSR is formulated using measurable key indicators for which the Supervisory Board has resolved the target and threshold values shown in the graphic below. These apply throughout the fouryear term of the installment. During the fouryear term the Supervisory Board determines the degree of target achievement each year within a range of to this is based on the results achieved in the respective fiscal year. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.29927651561295254,,,

2065,As outlined above the performance period for the LTI installment ended on September and all conditions for payment were fulfilled at this time. Accordingly in the interests of a more accurate allocation to the period the payout of the LTI is disclosed as part of the compensation awarded or due in fiscal year even though payment will only be made in December and thus in the following fiscal year . Like the STI disclosure the aim of this method of presentation is to enhance the clarity and comprehensibility of the compensation report and is in line with the market practice on the interpretation of the term awarded or due pursuant to AktG. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.29276316357188115,,,

2070,All Executive Board members are required to purchase thyssenkrupp shares to a total value of one full annual fixed salary gross and to hold them for the duration of their appointment. This brings the interests of the Executive Board and shareholders further into alignment and in addition to the LTI recognizes thyssenkrupps sustainable and longterm development. The annual investment is of the net payout from the performancerelated compensation components STI and LTI in the respective fiscal year until the prescribed investment amount is reached. Fulfillment of the share buy and hold requirement is determined based on the purchase price at the acquisition date. Under the program in effect in fiscal year shares were purchased using the STI paid in December for fiscal year . No LTI was paid in fiscal year . Therefore the payment from the LTI for due in December will not be withheld until fiscal year . In the case of Dr. Volkmar Dinstuhl Ilse Henne and Dr. Jens Schulte who were appointed during the year on January Dr. Volkmar Dinstuhl Ilse Henne and June Dr. Jens Schulte no variable compensation payment was yet due in fiscal year therefore no shares could be purchased under the SOG with the withheld parts of the variable compensation. In his case the first purchase of shares will be made in fiscal year out of the payout due in December for the STI for fiscal year . However Dr. Jens Schulte made use of the option to transfer shares he had previously purchased privately to the SOG program on a onetime basis upon joining the Executive Board. By contrast for Dr. Klaus Keysberg the obligation to hold the shares purchased under the applicable SOG ended when his service contract ended on July . Moreover he no longer has an obligation to purchase shares in the future. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.28632631917105006,,,

2140,The compensation system for the Supervisory Board is governed by of the Articles of Association and provides both the abstract and the concrete framework for Supervisory Board member compensation. This ensures that compensation of Supervisory Board members always complies with the compensation system resolved by the Annual General Meeting. Under of the Articles of Association Supervisory Board members are entitled to an annual basic compensation component and a meeting attendance fee. The amount of compensation awarded to members of the Supervisory Board is based on the members duties on the Supervisory Board or its committees. The compensation arrangements therefore reflect the requirements of the GCGC in particular. The fixed basic compensation the compensation for additional committee activities meeting attendance fees and the lack of any performancerelated Supervisory Board compensation are intended in particular to promote the independence of Supervisory Board members. The supervisory and advisory activities usefully carried out by the Supervisory Board are intended to support the companys longterm development. ,,0.33519279314606826,,,,,,,0.3294283381943927,0.3488931836205336,,,,,0.33271547464169915,0.35678612238274404,,,
