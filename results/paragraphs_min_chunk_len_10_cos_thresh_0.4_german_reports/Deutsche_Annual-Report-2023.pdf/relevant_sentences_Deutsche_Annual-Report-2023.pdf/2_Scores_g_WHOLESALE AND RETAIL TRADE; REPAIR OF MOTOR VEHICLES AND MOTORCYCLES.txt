Individual noncurrent assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if they are available for immediate sale in their present condition subject only to the customary sales terms of such assets and disposal groups and their sale is considered highly probable. For a sale to be highly probable management must be committed to a sales plan and be actively looking for a buyer and has no substantive regulatory approvals outstanding. Furthermore the assets and disposal groups must be actively marketed at a reasonable sales price in relation to their current fair value and the sale should be expected to be completed within one year. Noncurrent nonfinancial assets and disposal groups which meet the criteria for held for sale classification are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal and are presented within Other assets and Other liabilities in the balance sheet. Financial assets and liabilities meeting the criteria continue to be measured in accordance with IFRS . The comparatives are not represented when noncurrent assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale.

The Group presents interest income and expense calculated using the EIR method separately in the Groups consolidated statement of income. Commissions and fee income The Group applies the IFRS Revenue from Contracts with Customers fivestep revenue recognition model to the recognition of Commissions and Fee Income under which income must be recognized when control of goods and services is transferred hence the contractual performance obligations to the customer has been satisfied. Accordingly after a contract with a customer has been identified in the first step the second step is to identify the performance obligation or a series of distinct performance obligations provided to the customer. The Group must examine whether the service is capable of being distinct and is actually distinct within the context of the contract. A promised service is distinct if the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and the promise to transfer the service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The amount of income is measured on the basis of the contractually agreed transaction price for the performance obligation defined in the contract. If a contract includes a variable consideration the Group estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. Income is recognized in profit and loss when the identified performance obligation has been satisfied. The Group does not present information about its remaining performance obligations if it is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less. The Group determines the standalone selling price at contract inception of a distinct service underlying each performance obligation in the contract and allocates the transaction price in proportion to those standalone selling prices. The standalone selling price is the price at which DB would sell a promised service separately to a customer on an unbundled basis. The best evidence of a standalone selling price is the observable price of a service when the Group sells that service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. If the Group does not sell the service to a customer separately it estimates the standalone selling price at an amount using a suitable method for example in loan syndication transactions the Group applies the requirements for recognition of trade day profit and considers the price at which other market participants provide the same service on an unbundled basis. As such when estimating a standalone selling price the Group considers all information including market conditions that is reasonably available to it. In doing so the Group maximizes the use of observable inputs and applies estimation methods consistently in similar circumstances. The Group provides asset management services that give rise to asset management and performance fees and constitute a single performance obligation. The asset management and performance fee components are variable considerations such that at each reporting date the Group estimates the fee amount to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised services to the customer. The benefits arising from the asset management services are simultaneously received and consumed by the customer over time. The Group recognizes revenue over time by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation subject to the removal of any uncertainty as to whether it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized would occur or not. For the management fee component this is the end of the monthly or quarterly service period. For performance fees this date is when any uncertainty related to the performance component has been fully removed. Loan commitment fees related to commitments that are accounted for off balance sheet are recognized in commissions and fee income over the life of the commitment if it is unlikely that the Group will enter into a specific lending arrangement. If it is probable that the Group will enter into a specific lending arrangement the loan commitment fee is deferred until the origination of a loan and recognized as an adjustment to the loans effective interest rate. Commissions and Fee Income predominantly earned from services that are received and consumed by the customer over time Administration assets under management foreign commercial business loan processing and guarantees sundry other customer services. The Group recognizes revenue from these services over time by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation subject to the removal of any uncertainty as to whether it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized would occur or not. Commissions and Fee Income predominantly earned from providing services at a point in time or transactiontype services include other securities underwriting and advisory fees brokerage fees local payments foreign currency exchange business and intermediary fees. Expenses that are directly related and incremental to the generation of Commissions and Fee Income are presented net in Commissions and Fee Income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. This includes income and associated expense where the Group contractually owns the performance obligation i.e. as Principal in relation to the service that gives rise to the revenue and associated expense. In contrast it does not include situations where the Group does not contractually own the performance obligation and is acting as agent. The determination of whether the Group is acting as principal or agent is based on the contractual terms of the underlying service arrangement. The gross Commissions and Fee Income and Expense amounts are disclosed in Note Commissions and Fee Income.

Segment assets are presented in the Groups internal management reporting based on a consolidated view i.e. the amounts do not include intersegment balances. The Groups internal management reporting does not consider segment liabilities or interest expense separately. Similarly depreciation and amortization tax expenses and other comprehensive income are not presented separately internally and are therefore not disclosed here. NonIFRS compliant accounting methods used in the Groups management reporting represent either valuation or classification differences. The largest valuation differences relate to measurement at fair value in management reporting versus measurement at amortized cost under IFRS and to the recognition of trading results from own shares in revenues in management reporting in Investment Bank and in equity under IFRS. The major classification difference relates to noncontrolling interest which represents the net share of minority shareholders in revenues provision for credit losses noninterest expenses and income tax expenses. Noncontrolling interest is reported as a component of the profit before tax of the businesses in management reporting with a reversal in Corporate Other and a component of net income appropriation under IFRS. Since the Groups business activities are diverse in nature and its operations are integrated certain estimates and judgments have been made to apportion revenue and expense items among the business segments. The management reporting systems allocate the Groups external net interest income according to the value of funding consumed or provided by each business segments activities in accordance with the banks internal funds transfer pricing framework. Furthermore to retain comparability with those competitors that have legally independent units with their own equity funding the Group allocates a net notional interest benefit on its consolidated capital in line with each segments proportion of average shareholders equity. Management uses certain measures for equity and related ratios as part of its internal reporting system because it believes that these measures provide it with a useful indication of the financial performance of the business segments. The Group discloses such measures to provide investors and analysts with further insight into how management operates the Groups businesses and to enable them to better understand the Groups results.

In the course of its business the Group regularly applies for and receives government support by means of Export Credit Agency ECA guarantees covering transfer and default risks for the financing of exports and investments into Emerging Markets and to a lesser extent developed markets for Structured Trade Export Finance and short and mediumterm Trade Finance business. Almost all exportoriented states have established such ECAs to support their domestic exporters. The ECAs act in the name and on behalf of the government of their respective country and are either constituted directly as governmental departments or organized as private companies vested with the official mandate of the government to act on its behalf. Terms and conditions of such ECA guarantees are broadly similar due to the fact that most of the ECAs act within the scope of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD consensus rules. The OECD consensus rules an intergovernmental agreement of the OECD member states define benchmarks intended to ensure that a fair competition between different exporting nations will take place. In some countries dedicated funding programs with governmental support are offered for ECAcovered financings. The Group makes use of such programs to assist its clients in the financing of exported goods and services. In certain financings the Group also receives government guarantees from national and international governmental institutions as collateral to support financings in the interest of the respective governments. The majority of such ECA guarantees received by the Group were issued either by the EulerHermes S.A. acting on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany by the Atradius Credito y Caucion S.A. de Seguros y Reaseguros acting on behalf of the Kingdom of Spain or by the Korea Trade Insurance Corporation acting on behalf of the Republic of Korea.

The Group classifies financial assets in line with the classification and measurement requirements of IFRS where financial assets are classified based on both the business model used for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset known as Solely Payments of Principal and Interest or SPPI. There are three business models available Hold to Collect Financial assets held with the objective to collect contractual cash flows. They are subsequently measured at amortized cost and are recorded in multiple lines on the Groups consolidated balance sheet. Hold to Collect and Sell Financial assets held with the objective of both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. They are recorded as Financial assets at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income on the Groups consolidated balance sheet. Other Financial assets that do not meet the criteria of either Hold to Collect or Hold to Collect and Sell. They are recorded as Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss on the Groups consolidated balance sheet. The assessment of business model requires judgment based on facts and circumstances upon initial recognition. As part of this assessment the Group considers quantitative factors e.g. the expected frequency and volume of sales and qualitative factors such as how the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the Groups key management personnel. In addition to taking into consideration the risks that affect the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model in particular the way in which those market and credit risks are managed and how managers of the business are compensated e.g. whether the compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected. This assessment results in an asset being classified in either a Hold to Collect Hold to Collect and Sell or Other business model. If the Group holds a financial asset either in a Hold to Collect or a Hold to Collect and Sell business model then an assessment at initial recognition to determine whether the contractual cash flows of the financial asset are Solely Payments of Principal and Interest on the principal amount outstanding is required to determine the financial asset classification. Contractual cash flows that are SPPI on the principal amount outstanding are consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Interest in a basic lending arrangement is consideration for the time value of money and the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time. It can also include consideration for other basic lending risks e.g. liquidity risk and costs e.g. administrative costs associated with holding the financial asset for a particular period of time and a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Where cash flows can change over time due to contingent events such as terms where the margin on a loan adjusts depending on the performance of the borrower on certain contractual ESG metrics the contingent event and cash flows are assessed to determine if the instrument cash flows are SPPI. The nature of the contingent event and the size of the possible change in cash flows are taken into account in this assessment on an absolute and relative basis compared to the overall coupon. Additionally as part of the SPPI assessment where the lending is nonrecourse in nature then further assessment is made to determine if the cash flows are consistent with SPPI which is dependent on the nature of the underlying the level of subordination and the contractual cash flows of the instrument held. The Group originates and purchases debt instruments from entities issuing multiple tranches of debt. Where these instruments meet the definition of a contractually linked instruments then further analysis is performed on the cash flows and credit risk exposure of the instrument held as well as the underlying collateral held at purchase and can be held in the future.

In the third quarter of approximately FTEs moved from Corporate Other to the operating business segments driven by the banks decision that the Chief Operating Office will no longer be a separate Management Board function. Accordingly businessrelated parts of Chief Operating Office that support the Investment Bank and the Corporate Bank which were previously run in Infrastructure moved to those divisions. Comparative segmental financial information is presented accordingly. This change did not result in a material financial impact at a segment level as costs are allocated from Corporate Other to the operating business segments that are using the service of the respective infrastructure functions and with this move the costs are directly incurred by the divisions rather than being charged to Corporate Other.

The amendments clarify that the classification of liabilities as current or noncurrent should be based on rights that are in existence at the end of the reporting period. The amendments also clarify that the classification is unaffected by expectations about whether an entity will exercise its right to defer settlement of a liability and make clear that settlement refers to the transfer to the counterparty of cash equity instruments other assets or services. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January with early adoption permitted. They will not have a material impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements. In October the IASB issued a further amendment to IAS that modifies the requirements described above on how an entity classifies debt and other financial liabilities as current or noncurrent in particular circumstances. Accordingly it clarifies that only covenants with which an entity is required to comply on or before the reporting date affect the classification of a liability as current or noncurrent. In line with the previous amendments the new amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January with early adoption permitted. The amendments will not have a material impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements.

Total trading assets as of December and December of . billion and . billion are comprised primarily of . billion and . billion in securitizations and . billion and . billion in funds structured entities respectively. The Groups interests in securitizations are collateralized by the assets contained in these entities. Where the Group holds fund units these are typically in regard to market making in funds or otherwise serve as hedges for notes issued to clients. Moreover the credit risk arising from loans made to third party funding structured entities is mitigated by the collateral received. Nontrading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss includes reverse repurchase agreements to funds which comprise the majority of the interests in this category and are collateralized by the underlying securities. Loans as of December and December consist of . billion and . billion investment in securitization tranches and financing to third party funding entities. The Groups financing to third party funding entities is collateralized by the assets in those structured entities. Other assets as of December and December of . billion and . billion respectively consist primarily of cash margin balances. Pending Receivable balances are not included in this disclosure note due to the fact that these balances arise from typical customer supplier relationships out of e.g. brokerage type activities and their inherent volatility would not provide users of the financial statements with effective information about Deutsche Banks exposures to structured entities.

Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied. Performance obligation is satisfied by fund performance exceeding a hurdle rate an agreed minimum annual return provided to investors. As of December there were performance obligations to be satisfied of million with a time band of three years from to as of December million with a time band of three years from to from Alternative funds. The decrease of performance obligations to be satisfied was mainly driven by decline in the real estate valuations due to market conditions. As of December and December the Groups balance of receivables from commission and fee income was million and million respectively. As of December and December the Groups balance of contract liabilities associated to commission and fee income was million and million respectively. Contract liabilities arise from the Groups obligation to provide future services to a customer for which it has received consideration from the customer prior to completion of the services. The balances of receivables and contract liabilities do not vary significantly from period to period reflecting the fact that they predominately relate to recurring service contracts with service periods of less than one year such as monthly current account services and quarterly asset management services. As a result prior period balances of contract liabilities are generally recognized in revenue in the subsequent period. Customer payment in exchange for services provided are generally subject to performance by the Group over the specific service period such that the Groups right to payment arises at the end of the service period when its performance obligations are fully completed. Therefore no material balance of contract asset is reported.

For purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows the Groups cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Such investments include cash and balances at central banks and demand deposits with banks. There are various circumstances in which cash and cash equivalent balances held by an entity are not available for use by the Group. Examples include cash and cash equivalent balances held by a subsidiary that operates in a country where exchange controls or other legal restrictions apply such that the balances are not available for general use by the Group or its subsidiaries. The Groups assignment of cash flows to the operating investing or financing category depends on the business model management approach. For the Group the primary operating activity is to manage financial assets and financial liabilities. Therefore the issuance and management of longterm borrowings is a core operating activity which is different than for a nonfinancial company where borrowing is not a principal revenue producing activity and thus is part of the financing category. The Group views the issuance of senior longterm debt as an operating activity. Senior longterm debt comprises structured notes and assetbacked securities which are designed and executed by the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank business line segments and which are revenue generating activities. The other component is debt issued by Treasury which is considered interchangeable with other funding sources. All funding costs are allocated to business activities to establish their profitability. Cash flows related to subordinated longterm debt and trust preferred securities are viewed differently than those related to seniorlong term debt because they are managed as an integral part of the Groups capital primarily to meet regulatory capital requirements. As a result they are not interchangeable with other operating liabilities but can only be interchanged with equity and thus are considered part of the financing category. The amounts shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows do not precisely match the movements in the consolidated balance sheet from one period to the next as they exclude noncash items such as movements due to foreign exchange translation and movements due to changes in the group of consolidated companies. Movements in balances carried at fair value through profit or loss represent all changes affecting the carrying value. This includes the effects of market movements and cash inflows and outflows. The movements in balances carried at fair value are usually presented in operating cash flows.

On January the Group adopted amendments to IAS Income Taxes. These amendments changed the deferred tax treatment related to assets and liabilities in a single transaction such that they introduce an exemption from the initial recognition exemption provided in IAS .b and IAS .. Accordingly the initial recognition exemption does not apply to transactions in which both deductible and taxable temporary differences arise on initial recognition that result in the recognition of equal deferred tax assets and liabilities. Neither of these amendments had a material impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements. In December the Organization for Economic CoOperation and Development OECD issued Global AntiBase Erosion and Profit Shifting BEPS Rules under the Pillar Framework. In May the IASB issued amendments to IAS Income Taxes to introduce a mandatory temporary exception to the accounting for deferred taxes arising from the implementation of Pillar model rules and disclosure requirements. The application of the exception outlined above had to be applied immediately with the disclosure requirements to be effective for annual periods beginning on or after January . The mandatory temporary exception has been applied and there has been no impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements.

These criteria are discussed in Note Material Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates. Where financial assets are not eligible to be derecognized the transfers are viewed as secured financing transactions with any consideration received resulting in a corresponding liability. The Group is not entitled to use these financial assets for any other purposes.

Operational Risk Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events. The definition used for the purposes of determining operational provisions differs from the risk management definition as it excludes risk of loss resulting from civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters. For risk management purposes operational risk includes legal risk as payments to customers counterparties and regulatory bodies in civil litigations or regulatory enforcement matters constitute loss events for operational shortcomings but excludes business and reputational risk. Civil Litigation provisions arise out of current or potential claims or proceedings alleging noncompliance with contractual or other legal or regulatory responsibilities which have resulted or may result in demands from customers counterparties or other parties in civil litigations. Regulatory Enforcement provisions arise out of current or potential claims or proceedings alleging noncompliance with legal or regulatory responsibilities which have resulted or may result in an assessment of fines or penalties by governmental regulatory agencies selfregulatory organizations or other enforcement authorities. Restructuring provisions arise out of restructuring activities. The Group aims to enhance its longterm competitiveness through major reductions in costs duplication and complexity in the years ahead. For details see Note Restructuring. Other provisions include several specific items arising from a variety of different circumstances including the provision for the reimbursement of loan processing fees deferred sales commissions provisions for bank levies and mortgage repurchase demands.

The Group recognizes the current and deferred tax consequences of transactions that have been included in the consolidated financial statements using the provisions of the respective jurisdictions tax laws. Current and deferred taxes are recognized in profit or loss except to the extent that the tax relates to items that are recognized directly in equity or other comprehensive income in which case the related tax is recognized either directly in equity or other comprehensive income accordingly. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases unused tax losses and unused tax credits. Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which those unused tax losses unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period that the asset is realized or the liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset when they arise from the same tax reporting entity or tax group of reporting entities the legally enforceable right to offset exists and they are intended to be settled net or realized simultaneously. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities exists and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxing authority on either the same tax reporting entity or tax group of reporting entities. Deferred tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries branches and associates and interests in joint ventures except when the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets are provided on deductible temporary differences arising from such investments only to the extent that it is probable that the differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and sufficient taxable income will be available against which those temporary differences can be utilized. Deferred tax related to fair value remeasurement of financial assets classified as FVTOCI cash flow hedges and other items which are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income is also credited or charged directly to other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income once the underlying transaction or event to which the deferred tax relates is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. For sharebased payment transactions the Group may receive a tax deduction related to the compensation paid in shares. The amount deductible for tax purposes may differ from the cumulative compensation expense recorded. At any reporting date the Group must estimate the expected future tax deduction based on the current share price. The associated current and deferred tax consequences are recognized as income or expense in the consolidated statement of Income for the period. If the amount deductible or expected to be deductible for tax purposes exceeds the cumulative compensation expense the excess tax benefit is recognized directly in equity. Critical accounting estimates In determining the amount of deferred tax assets the Group uses historical tax capacity and profitability information and if relevant forecasted operating results based upon approved business plans including a review of the eligible carryforward periods available tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. The analysis of the historical tax capacity includes the determination as to whether a period of past profits or a history of recent losses exists at the reporting date. The determination of a period of past profits or a history of recent losses is based on the pretax results adjusted for permanent differences and typically covers the current and the two preceding financial years. Each quarter the Group reevaluates its estimate related to deferred tax assets. The Group believes that the accounting estimate related to the deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period and requires significant management judgment. For example tax law changes changes in the historical tax capacity or variances in future projected operating performance could result in a change of the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset. If the Group was not able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to its deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense or directly to equity in the period such determination was made. If the Group was to recognize previously unrecognized deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to its deferred tax asset would be credited to income tax expense or directly to equity in the period such determination was made.
