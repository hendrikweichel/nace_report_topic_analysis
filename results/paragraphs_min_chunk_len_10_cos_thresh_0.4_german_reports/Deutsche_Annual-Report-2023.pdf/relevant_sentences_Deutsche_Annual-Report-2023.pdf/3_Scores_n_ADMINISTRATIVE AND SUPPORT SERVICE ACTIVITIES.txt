In the third quarter of approximately FTEs moved from Corporate Other to the operating business segments driven by the banks decision that the Chief Operating Office will no longer be a separate Management Board function. Accordingly businessrelated parts of Chief Operating Office that support the Investment Bank and the Corporate Bank which were previously run in Infrastructure moved to those divisions. Comparative segmental financial information is presented accordingly. This change did not result in a material financial impact at a segment level as costs are allocated from Corporate Other to the operating business segments that are using the service of the respective infrastructure functions and with this move the costs are directly incurred by the divisions rather than being charged to Corporate Other.

Revenues excluding specific items is a performance indicator that is a nonGAAP financial measure most directly comparable to the IFRS financial measure net revenues. Revenues excluding specific items is calculated by adjusting net revenues under IFRS for specific revenue items which generally fall outside the usual nature or scope of the business and are likely to distort an accurate assessment of the divisional operating performance. Excluded items are Debt Valuation Adjustment DVA and material transactions or events that are either oneoff in nature or belong to a portfolio of connected transactions or events where the PL impact is limited to a specific period of time. The Group believes that a presentation of net revenues excluding the impact of these items provides a more meaningful depiction of the revenues associated with the business.

The Group enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets held on the balance sheet and as a result may either be eligible to derecognize the transferred asset in its entirety or must continue to recognize the transferred asset to the extent of any continuing involvement depending on certain criteria. These criteria are discussed in Note Material Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates. Where financial assets are not eligible to be derecognized the transfers are viewed as secured financing transactions with any consideration received resulting in a corresponding liability. The Group is not entitled to use these financial assets for any other purposes. The most common transactions of this nature entered into by the Group are repurchase agreements securities lending agreements and total return swaps in which the Group retains substantially all of the associated credit equity price interest rate and foreign exchange risks and rewards associated with the assets as well as the associated income streams.

Segment assets are presented in the Groups internal management reporting based on a consolidated view i.e. the amounts do not include intersegment balances. The Groups internal management reporting does not consider segment liabilities or interest expense separately. Similarly depreciation and amortization tax expenses and other comprehensive income are not presented separately internally and are therefore not disclosed here. NonIFRS compliant accounting methods used in the Groups management reporting represent either valuation or classification differences. The largest valuation differences relate to measurement at fair value in management reporting versus measurement at amortized cost under IFRS and to the recognition of trading results from own shares in revenues in management reporting in Investment Bank and in equity under IFRS. The major classification difference relates to noncontrolling interest which represents the net share of minority shareholders in revenues provision for credit losses noninterest expenses and income tax expenses. Noncontrolling interest is reported as a component of the profit before tax of the businesses in management reporting with a reversal in Corporate Other and a component of net income appropriation under IFRS. Since the Groups business activities are diverse in nature and its operations are integrated certain estimates and judgments have been made to apportion revenue and expense items among the business segments. The management reporting systems allocate the Groups external net interest income according to the value of funding consumed or provided by each business segments activities in accordance with the banks internal funds transfer pricing framework. Furthermore to retain comparability with those competitors that have legally independent units with their own equity funding the Group allocates a net notional interest benefit on its consolidated capital in line with each segments proportion of average shareholders equity. Management uses certain measures for equity and related ratios as part of its internal reporting system because it believes that these measures provide it with a useful indication of the financial performance of the business segments. The Group discloses such measures to provide investors and analysts with further insight into how management operates the Groups businesses and to enable them to better understand the Groups results.

The Group classifies financial assets in line with the classification and measurement requirements of IFRS where financial assets are classified based on both the business model used for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset known as Solely Payments of Principal and Interest or SPPI. There are three business models available Hold to Collect Financial assets held with the objective to collect contractual cash flows. They are subsequently measured at amortized cost and are recorded in multiple lines on the Groups consolidated balance sheet. Hold to Collect and Sell Financial assets held with the objective of both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. They are recorded as Financial assets at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income on the Groups consolidated balance sheet. Other Financial assets that do not meet the criteria of either Hold to Collect or Hold to Collect and Sell. They are recorded as Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss on the Groups consolidated balance sheet. The assessment of business model requires judgment based on facts and circumstances upon initial recognition. As part of this assessment the Group considers quantitative factors e.g. the expected frequency and volume of sales and qualitative factors such as how the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the Groups key management personnel. In addition to taking into consideration the risks that affect the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model in particular the way in which those market and credit risks are managed and how managers of the business are compensated e.g. whether the compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected. This assessment results in an asset being classified in either a Hold to Collect Hold to Collect and Sell or Other business model. If the Group holds a financial asset either in a Hold to Collect or a Hold to Collect and Sell business model then an assessment at initial recognition to determine whether the contractual cash flows of the financial asset are Solely Payments of Principal and Interest on the principal amount outstanding is required to determine the financial asset classification. Contractual cash flows that are SPPI on the principal amount outstanding are consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Interest in a basic lending arrangement is consideration for the time value of money and the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time. It can also include consideration for other basic lending risks e.g. liquidity risk and costs e.g. administrative costs associated with holding the financial asset for a particular period of time and a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Where cash flows can change over time due to contingent events such as terms where the margin on a loan adjusts depending on the performance of the borrower on certain contractual ESG metrics the contingent event and cash flows are assessed to determine if the instrument cash flows are SPPI. The nature of the contingent event and the size of the possible change in cash flows are taken into account in this assessment on an absolute and relative basis compared to the overall coupon. Additionally as part of the SPPI assessment where the lending is nonrecourse in nature then further assessment is made to determine if the cash flows are consistent with SPPI which is dependent on the nature of the underlying the level of subordination and the contractual cash flows of the instrument held. The Group originates and purchases debt instruments from entities issuing multiple tranches of debt. Where these instruments meet the definition of a contractually linked instruments then further analysis is performed on the cash flows and credit risk exposure of the instrument held as well as the underlying collateral held at purchase and can be held in the future.

Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied. Performance obligation is satisfied by fund performance exceeding a hurdle rate an agreed minimum annual return provided to investors. As of December there were performance obligations to be satisfied of million with a time band of three years from to as of December million with a time band of three years from to from Alternative funds. The decrease of performance obligations to be satisfied was mainly driven by decline in the real estate valuations due to market conditions. As of December and December the Groups balance of receivables from commission and fee income was million and million respectively. As of December and December the Groups balance of contract liabilities associated to commission and fee income was million and million respectively. Contract liabilities arise from the Groups obligation to provide future services to a customer for which it has received consideration from the customer prior to completion of the services. The balances of receivables and contract liabilities do not vary significantly from period to period reflecting the fact that they predominately relate to recurring service contracts with service periods of less than one year such as monthly current account services and quarterly asset management services. As a result prior period balances of contract liabilities are generally recognized in revenue in the subsequent period. Customer payment in exchange for services provided are generally subject to performance by the Group over the specific service period such that the Groups right to payment arises at the end of the service period when its performance obligations are fully completed. Therefore no material balance of contract asset is reported.

For purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows the Groups cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Such investments include cash and balances at central banks and demand deposits with banks. There are various circumstances in which cash and cash equivalent balances held by an entity are not available for use by the Group. Examples include cash and cash equivalent balances held by a subsidiary that operates in a country where exchange controls or other legal restrictions apply such that the balances are not available for general use by the Group or its subsidiaries. The Groups assignment of cash flows to the operating investing or financing category depends on the business model management approach. For the Group the primary operating activity is to manage financial assets and financial liabilities. Therefore the issuance and management of longterm borrowings is a core operating activity which is different than for a nonfinancial company where borrowing is not a principal revenue producing activity and thus is part of the financing category. The Group views the issuance of senior longterm debt as an operating activity. Senior longterm debt comprises structured notes and assetbacked securities which are designed and executed by the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank business line segments and which are revenue generating activities. The other component is debt issued by Treasury which is considered interchangeable with other funding sources. All funding costs are allocated to business activities to establish their profitability. Cash flows related to subordinated longterm debt and trust preferred securities are viewed differently than those related to seniorlong term debt because they are managed as an integral part of the Groups capital primarily to meet regulatory capital requirements. As a result they are not interchangeable with other operating liabilities but can only be interchanged with equity and thus are considered part of the financing category. The amounts shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows do not precisely match the movements in the consolidated balance sheet from one period to the next as they exclude noncash items such as movements due to foreign exchange translation and movements due to changes in the group of consolidated companies. Movements in balances carried at fair value through profit or loss represent all changes affecting the carrying value. This includes the effects of market movements and cash inflows and outflows. The movements in balances carried at fair value are usually presented in operating cash flows.

The Group presents interest income and expense calculated using the EIR method separately in the Groups consolidated statement of income. Commissions and fee income The Group applies the IFRS Revenue from Contracts with Customers fivestep revenue recognition model to the recognition of Commissions and Fee Income under which income must be recognized when control of goods and services is transferred hence the contractual performance obligations to the customer has been satisfied. Accordingly after a contract with a customer has been identified in the first step the second step is to identify the performance obligation or a series of distinct performance obligations provided to the customer. The Group must examine whether the service is capable of being distinct and is actually distinct within the context of the contract. A promised service is distinct if the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and the promise to transfer the service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The amount of income is measured on the basis of the contractually agreed transaction price for the performance obligation defined in the contract. If a contract includes a variable consideration the Group estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. Income is recognized in profit and loss when the identified performance obligation has been satisfied. The Group does not present information about its remaining performance obligations if it is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less. The Group determines the standalone selling price at contract inception of a distinct service underlying each performance obligation in the contract and allocates the transaction price in proportion to those standalone selling prices. The standalone selling price is the price at which DB would sell a promised service separately to a customer on an unbundled basis. The best evidence of a standalone selling price is the observable price of a service when the Group sells that service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. If the Group does not sell the service to a customer separately it estimates the standalone selling price at an amount using a suitable method for example in loan syndication transactions the Group applies the requirements for recognition of trade day profit and considers the price at which other market participants provide the same service on an unbundled basis. As such when estimating a standalone selling price the Group considers all information including market conditions that is reasonably available to it. In doing so the Group maximizes the use of observable inputs and applies estimation methods consistently in similar circumstances. The Group provides asset management services that give rise to asset management and performance fees and constitute a single performance obligation. The asset management and performance fee components are variable considerations such that at each reporting date the Group estimates the fee amount to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised services to the customer. The benefits arising from the asset management services are simultaneously received and consumed by the customer over time. The Group recognizes revenue over time by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation subject to the removal of any uncertainty as to whether it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized would occur or not. For the management fee component this is the end of the monthly or quarterly service period. For performance fees this date is when any uncertainty related to the performance component has been fully removed. Loan commitment fees related to commitments that are accounted for off balance sheet are recognized in commissions and fee income over the life of the commitment if it is unlikely that the Group will enter into a specific lending arrangement. If it is probable that the Group will enter into a specific lending arrangement the loan commitment fee is deferred until the origination of a loan and recognized as an adjustment to the loans effective interest rate. Commissions and Fee Income predominantly earned from services that are received and consumed by the customer over time Administration assets under management foreign commercial business loan processing and guarantees sundry other customer services. The Group recognizes revenue from these services over time by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation subject to the removal of any uncertainty as to whether it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized would occur or not. Commissions and Fee Income predominantly earned from providing services at a point in time or transactiontype services include other securities underwriting and advisory fees brokerage fees local payments foreign currency exchange business and intermediary fees. Expenses that are directly related and incremental to the generation of Commissions and Fee Income are presented net in Commissions and Fee Income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. This includes income and associated expense where the Group contractually owns the performance obligation i.e. as Principal in relation to the service that gives rise to the revenue and associated expense. In contrast it does not include situations where the Group does not contractually own the performance obligation and is acting as agent. The determination of whether the Group is acting as principal or agent is based on the contractual terms of the underlying service arrangement. The gross Commissions and Fee Income and Expense amounts are disclosed in Note Commissions and Fee Income.

Operational Risk Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events. The definition used for the purposes of determining operational provisions differs from the risk management definition as it excludes risk of loss resulting from civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters. For risk management purposes operational risk includes legal risk as payments to customers counterparties and regulatory bodies in civil litigations or regulatory enforcement matters constitute loss events for operational shortcomings but excludes business and reputational risk. Civil Litigation provisions arise out of current or potential claims or proceedings alleging noncompliance with contractual or other legal or regulatory responsibilities which have resulted or may result in demands from customers counterparties or other parties in civil litigations. Regulatory Enforcement provisions arise out of current or potential claims or proceedings alleging noncompliance with legal or regulatory responsibilities which have resulted or may result in an assessment of fines or penalties by governmental regulatory agencies selfregulatory organizations or other enforcement authorities. Restructuring provisions arise out of restructuring activities. The Group aims to enhance its longterm competitiveness through major reductions in costs duplication and complexity in the years ahead. For details see Note Restructuring. Other provisions include several specific items arising from a variety of different circumstances including the provision for the reimbursement of loan processing fees deferred sales commissions provisions for bank levies and mortgage repurchase demands.

The following table presents total net revenues before provision for credit losses by geographic area for the years ended December and respectively. The information presented for Corporate Bank Investment Bank Private Bank and Asset Management has been classified based primarily on the location of the Groups office in which the revenues are recorded.

Positive and Negative Market Values from Derivative Instruments categorized in this level of the fair value hierarchy are valued based on one or more significant unobservable parameters. The unobservable parameters may include certain correlations certain longerterm volatilities certain prepayment rates credit spreads and other transactionspecific parameters. Level derivatives include certain options where the volatility is unobservable certain basket options in which the correlations between the referenced underlying assets are unobservable longerterm interest rate option derivatives multicurrency foreign exchange derivatives and certain credit default swaps for which the credit spread is not observable. The decrease in assets during the period are driven by net transfers between Level and Level due to changes in the observability of input parameters used to value these instruments and settlements partially offset by gains. The decrease in liabilities during the period are driven by net transfers between Level and Level due to changes in the observability of input parameters used to value these instruments and settlements partially offset by losses. Other Trading Instruments classified in Level of the fair value hierarchy mainly consist of traded loans valued using valuation models based on one or more significant unobservable parameters.

The corporate loans are valued using valuation techniques which incorporate observable credit spreads recovery rates and unobservable utilization parameters. Revolving loan facilities are reported in the third level of the hierarchy because the utilization in the event of the default parameter is significant and unobservable. In addition certain hybrid debt issuances designated at fair value through profit or loss containing embedded derivatives are valued based on significant unobservable parameters. These unobservable parameters include single stock volatility correlations. The decrease in assets during the period is driven by settlements. The increase in liabilities during the period is driven by issuances and losses partially offset by net transfers between Level and Level due to changes in the observability of input parameters used to value these instruments and settlements.

Total trading assets as of December and December of . billion and . billion are comprised primarily of . billion and . billion in securitizations and . billion and . billion in funds structured entities respectively. The Groups interests in securitizations are collateralized by the assets contained in these entities. Where the Group holds fund units these are typically in regard to market making in funds or otherwise serve as hedges for notes issued to clients. Moreover the credit risk arising from loans made to third party funding structured entities is mitigated by the collateral received. Nontrading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss includes reverse repurchase agreements to funds which comprise the majority of the interests in this category and are collateralized by the underlying securities. Loans as of December and December consist of . billion and . billion investment in securitization tranches and financing to third party funding entities. The Groups financing to third party funding entities is collateralized by the assets in those structured entities. Other assets as of December and December of . billion and . billion respectively consist primarily of cash margin balances. Pending Receivable balances are not included in this disclosure note due to the fact that these balances arise from typical customer supplier relationships out of e.g. brokerage type activities and their inherent volatility would not provide users of the financial statements with effective information about Deutsche Banks exposures to structured entities.

The Group sponsors a number of postemployment benefit plans on behalf of its employees both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans. The Groups plans are accounted for based on the nature and substance of the plan. Generally for defined benefit plans the value of a participants accrued benefit is based on each employees remuneration and length of service contributions to defined contribution plans are typically based on a percentage of each employees remuneration. The rest of this note focuses predominantly on the Groups defined benefit plans. The Groups defined benefit plans are primarily described on a geographical basis reflecting differences in the nature and risks of benefits as well as in the respective regulatory environments. In particular the requirements set by local regulators can vary significantly and determine the design and financing of the benefit plans to a certain extent. Key information is also shown based on participant status which provides a broad indication of the maturity of the Groups obligations.
