52,As a result we have established a strong market position in all four business divisions. And we see potential to expand it further. That is why we made more investments in to accelerate our growth trajectory and take advantage of market opportunities. To this end we have driven product innovations and hired personnel in some key areas to improve our market coverage especially in areas where we can score points with clients with our highquality expertise and advice. This includes our Wealth Management business Client Coverage in the Corporate Bank and Origination Advisory in the Investment Bank. We have decisively strengthened the latter with the acquisition of the leading British corporate broker Numis. At the same time we have continued to invest in technology stringent processes and platforms and our controls. In recent years we have focused our investments here in order to meet the regulatory requirements and to effectively protect the bank. After investing more than billion again in improvements to our controls in we now assume that the remediation work on our most important regulatory programmes is now nearing completion. In terms of costs we are also at a turning point. In we deliberately put some major cost items behind us. In addition to investments in business technology and controls this included restructuring and severance costs related to the transformation strategy and extraordinary items such as amortization of goodwill at Numis. A large part of these costs will not repeat from which is why noninterest expenses should have reached their peak last year at . billion. ,,,,,,,,,,,0.4980358037935922,,,,,,,,

326,The Investment Bank is a key pillar of Deutsche Banks business. Across FIC and Origination and Advisory corporate and institutional clients access a comprehensive range of services encompassing financing market makingliquidity provision risk management solutions advisory and debt and equity issuance. The segment regionally encompasses EMEA Americas and APAC across both Investment Bank businesses and client footprint. In underlying markets were less conducive to client flows versus a very strong and the resulting uncertainty continued to depress levels of capital market and advisory activity. Despite this the Investment Bank continued to execute against its strategic priorities delivering an enhanced service offering to its clients and building on the progress made since the formation of the business in . The development of the Investment Banks FIC business has been pronounced with the longterm growth in revenue and market share reflecting the successful delivery against strategic objectives across multiple areas of the business. This success has been driven by a wide range of factors. A strong and stable management team is in place with the segment demonstrating its ability to attract leading talent via a number of specific and targeted senior hires into subbusiness leadership positions through . A defined technology strategy is delivering simplified and sustainable capability with over applications decommissioned in the past two years and investment into areas across the business is enabling product enhancements and the development of new capability for the divisions clients. This has been demonstrated by workflow solutions which provide clients access to Deutsche Banks product suite in a simplified and operationally efficient manner. The continued focus on the divisions clients has been enhanced via the creation of dedicated relationship management and client enablement functions within the Institutional Coverage Group. This ensures deeper strategic relationships with clients whilst providing them with the most efficient ways of working with Deutsche Bank. This is further enhanced by the significant increase in client engagement following the recent rating upgrades. The continued success has also been recognized externally. As an example Euromoney recognized Deutsche Bank as the leading global FX provider for a second year in a row. In an environment where fee pools continued to be restricted the focus of Origination Advisory has been building the platform to ensure the business is positioned to benefit when activity is expected to return in . A significant number of targeted senior hires have been made with a focus upon sectors and regions where Deutsche Bank is able to compete but is currently underweight. Alongside this organic growth the acquisition of Numis will further enhance Origination Advisorys depth of offering in the UK the largest EMEA fee pool whilst also enabling the crosssell of other segmental products into the client base. To ensure that strong relationships are maintained with clients the business has established a Client Strategy and Analytics team which will drive the depth of relationships with its client base and ensure close monitoring of performance at the most granular level. In the strategy of the Investment Bank is focused on working towards its vision of being the leading nonU.S. global investment bank and delivering upon the segments growth and return targets. This is aimed to be achieved via targeted growth investments and the continued development of its client strategy combined with a focus on technology data enabled capability capital efficiency and control. The investments made into the Origination Advisory franchise are expected to increase the weighting of strategic advisory revenues as a percentage of total revenues over time. Within FIC investment into existing businesses in areas where the division has a competitive advantage will continue. This will be complemented by the expansion into a small number of adjacent businesses where the existing platform and client base can be leveraged to enable growth at low marginal costs. The result of each of these will be a further diversification of revenue streams whilst also ensuring an enhanced and relevant product offering for the client base. Finally ESG remains a priority across the Investment Bank as the segment continues supporting its clients globally. Deutsche Bank held its second Sustainability Deep Dive in March providing insight into the different approaches that the bank has developed with clients across the globe. From a transaction perspective there were a number of key events in including completing a bespoke dealcontingent interest rate hedge and a tailored financing for Hai Long Taiwans largest offshore wind project to date and acting as global coordinator and joint active bookrunner on Air FranceKLMs billion inaugural sustainabilitylinked long year and long year bond offering. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3259702178253246,,,,,,

355,In Commercial Real Estate CRE markets continued to face headwinds due to the impacts of higher interest rates decreasing market liquidity combined with tightened lending conditions and structural changes in the office sector. The market stress has been more pronounced in the U.S. where property price indices point to a greater decline of CRE asset values from recent peaks compared to Europe and APAC. Especially within the office segment the market weakness is most evident in the U.S. reflected in subdued leasing activity and higher vacancy rates compared to Europe. The global Origination Advisory industry fee pool in fell a further following a drop in from record highs in driven by a subdued Mergers Acquisitions market challenging primary credit markets and largely inactive sponsors. Mergers Acquisitions in fell but was still higher than the preCOVID pandemic fee pool of billion while the fourth quarter had strong volumes. Equity Capital Markets issuance increased in as equity markets bounced back and volatility was low. The high yield market was up over from a decadelong low while leveraged loan issuance fell with sponsors choosing to continue their pause on acquisitions. The investment grade bond market remained relatively robust with issuance down in and has had a strong start to . Within Fixed Income revenue pools remained at elevated levels compared to historical averages although below the levels seen in . Foreign exchange activity decreased across the ten most traded currencies globally with Rates and Emerging Markets each declining from strong levels in the prior year. Conversely within Credit an increase year on year was driven by a more favorable environment for secondary trading with the general trend of tightening spreads while in Financing client demand remained stable and broadly aligned to prior year. ,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3871584622529383,,,,,,,

605,Deutsche Bank is still maturing in its overall data management strategy against its core processes and data sets such as transactional client and reference data. This includes the development and implementation of the banks enterprise architecture principles across the core technology infrastructure. This is central to Deutsche Banks wider technology and data strategy enabling business growth and efficiencies while also enhancing the control environment. Deutsche Banks regulators are actively engaged in ensuring the bank progresses with this component of its strategy. Furthermore the bank also faces challenges with respect to embracing and incorporating new and disruptive technologies in conjunction with existing technological architecture in order to ensure industry standards of information security and customer experience. Major technology transformations in the banks business and infrastructure areas are executed via dedicated initiatives. The benefits of these include IT and business cost reduction control improvements revenue growth through provision of new client features or targeted client growth. Program execution risks including talent and financial constraints dependencies to other programs and key deliverables also referred to as KDs extended implementation timelines or impact of the change related activity on the control environment or functionality issues in the upgraded applications or underlying technology are carefully managed to partially mitigate the risk of not fully achieving expected benefits. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.34310042493648674,,,,,,

611,Should economic conditions such as GDP growth levels of unemployment the interest rate environment and competitive conditions in the financial services industry improve beyond currently forecasted levels this could result in higher revenues. These impacts may only be partially offset by additional costs therefore improving the Groups ability to meet its financial targets. At the same time potentially higher inflation interest rates and market volatility could present a number of opportunities such as increased revenues from higher trading flows amid private corporate and institutional customers repositioning their portfolios higher net interest income as well as higher margins on lending across the Groups balance sheet. A substantial proportion of the assets and liabilities on the Groups balance sheet are of financial instruments carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. If market conditions improve or interest rates decline this could result in an increase in the fair value of certain financial instruments. As a result of such changes the Group may realize gains in the future. ,,,,,,,,,,,0.5148561961970963,,,,,,,,

728,The average LTV in the U.S. office loan segment was as of December versus as of December . LTV calculations are based on latest externally appraised values which are additionally subject to regular interim internal adjustments. While the Group is updating CRE collateral values where applicable such values and their underlying assumptions are subject to a higher degree of fluctuation and uncertainty in the current environment of heightened market volatility and reduced market liquidity. A continuation of the current stressed market conditions could have a further adverse impact on commercial real estate property values and LTV ratios. Stage classification and provisioning levels are primarily based on the Groups assessment of a borrowers ability to generate recurring cash flows its ability to obtain refinancing at the loans maturity and an assessment of the financed propertys collateral value. Deutsche Bank actively monitors these factors for potential signs of deterioration to ensure timely adjustment of the borrowers loan classifications. When a loan is deemed to be impaired the Group calculates required credit loss provisions using multiple potential scenarios for loan resolution weighted by their expected probabilities and taking into account information available at that point. Such assessments are inherently subjective with respect to scenario weightings and subject to various assumptions including future cash flows generated by a property and potential property liquidation proceeds. These assumptions are subject to uncertainties which are exacerbated in the current volatile market environment such that deviating developments to initial assumptions could have a material future impact on calculated provisions. Additional uncertainty exists within the office sector due to the uncertain longterm impact of remote working arrangements on demand for office space. Given the nearterm outlook for interest rates the Group expects stressed market conditions to continue into which could result in further deterioration of asset quality and higher credit loss provisions which is reflected in the communicated guidance on credit loss provisions for . ,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3995910876586497,,,,,,,

Enforcement activity also applies to cases where the Bank maintains outstanding and unsettled legal claims. This is irrespective of whether amounts are expected to be recovered and the recovery timeframe. It may be common practice in certain jurisdictions for recovery cases to span several years. Amounts outstanding on financial assets that were written off during the reporting period and are still subject to enforcement activity amounted to million in fiscal year mainly in Corporate Bank.

856,Collateral Deutsche Bank regularly agrees on collateral to be received from customers that are subject to credit risk or to be provided by third parties agreed by legally effective and enforceable contracts as documented by a written and reasoned legal opinion. Collateral is credit protection in the form of funded assigned or pledged assets or unfunded thirdparty obligations that serves to mitigate the inherent risk of credit loss in an exposure by either substituting the counterparty default risk or improving recoveries in the event of a default. Deutsche Bank generally takes all types of eligible collateral for its respective businesses but may limit accepted collateral types for specific businesses or regions as customary in the respective market or driven by purpose of efficiency. While collateral can be an alternative source of repayment it does not replace the necessity of highquality underwriting standards and a thorough assessment of the debt service ability of the counterparty in line with Article CRR. Deutsche Bank distinguishes the following two types of credit protection approaches Funded Credit Protection like financial and other collateral which enables Deutsche Bank to recover all or part of the outstanding exposure by liquidating the collateral asset provided in cases where the counterparty is unable or unwilling to fulfill its primary obligations. Cash collateral securities equity bonds collateral pledges or assignments of other claims or inventory movable assets i.e. plant machinery ships and aircraft and real estate typically fall into this category all financial collateral is regularly mostly daily revalued and measured against the respective credit exposure the value of other collateral including real estate is monitored based upon established processes that includes regular reviews or revaluations by internal andor external experts Unfunded Credit Protection like Guarantees which complement the counterpartys ability to fulfill its obligation under the legal contract and as such is provided by uncorrelated third parties. Letters of credit insurance contracts export credit insurance guarantees credit derivatives and unfunded risk participations typically fall into this category. Guarantees and strong letters of comfort provided by correlated group members of customers generally the parent company may also be accepted and considered in approved rating approaches guarantee collateral with a noninvestment grade rating of the guarantor is limited Deutsche Banks processes seek to ensure that the collateral accepted for risk mitigation purposes is of high quality. This includes processes to generally ensure legally effective and enforceable documentation for realizable and measurable collateral or assets which are evaluated within the onboarding process by dedicated internal appraisers or teams with the respective qualification skills and experience or adequate external valuers mandated in regulated processes. The applied valuations follow generally accepted valuation methods or models. Ongoing correctness of values is monitored by collateral typespecific appropriately frequent and eventdriven reviews considering relevant risk parameters. Revaluations are applied in cases of identified probable material deterioration and future monitoring may be adjusted respectively. The assessment of the suitability of collateral for a specific transaction is part of the credit decision and must be undertaken in a conservative way including collateral haircuts that are applied. Deutsche Bank has collateral type specific haircuts in place which are regularly reviewed and approved. In this regard Deutsche Bank strives to avoid wrongway risk characteristics where the counterpartys risk is positively correlated with the risk of deterioration in the collateral value. For unfunded credit protection like guarantees the process for the analysis of the guarantors creditworthiness is aligned to the credit assessment process for creditrelevant counterparties. The valuation of collateral is considered under a liquidation scenario. The liquidation value is equal to the expected proceeds of collateral monetization realization in a base case scenario wherein a fair price is achieved through careful preparation and orderly liquidation of the collateral. Collateral can either move in value over time dynamic value or not static value. The dynamic liquidation value generally includes a safety margin or haircut over realizable value to address liquidity and marketability aspects. ,,,,0.32348587410655083,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

928,The Management Board defines the liquidity and funding risk strategy for the Group and sets the risk appetite based on recommendations made by the Group Asset and Liability Committee and Group Risk Committee. The Management Board reviews and approves the risk appetite at least annually. The risk appetite is applied to the Group and to bespoke Key Liquidity Entities e.g. Deutsche Bank AG to monitor and control liquidity risk as well as the Groups longterm funding and issuance plan. The Liquidity Risk Management Framework defines the organization of the liquidity managing functions in alignment with the three lines of defense structure which is described in the Risk Management Policy. The Corporate Divisions and Treasury comprise the first line of defense responsible for executing the steps needed to most effectively manage the liquidity of the Group and steer business activities. Risk comprises the second line of defense responsible for defining the liquidity risk management framework providing independent risk oversight challenge and validation of activities conducted by the first line of defense including establishing the risk appetite. Group Audit comprises the third line of defense responsible for overseeing the activities of both the first line of defense and second line of defense. The Group Asset and Liability Committee is the Groups decisive governing body mandated by the Management Board to optimize the sourcing and deployment of the Groups balance sheet and financial resources in line with the Management Boards risk appetite and strategy. The Group Asset and Liability Committee has the overarching responsibility to define approve and optimize the Groups funding strategy. Regarding the second line of defense the Group Risk Committee is mandated by the Management Board with decisionmaking authority regarding material riskrelated topics. In addition it reviews and recommends items for Management Board approval including key risk management principles the Groups risk appetite statement recovery plan the contingency funding plan overarching risk appetite parameters and recovery and escalation indicators. The Groups liquidity risk management principles are documented in the Liquidity Risk Management Policy and the framework is described in the Global Liquidity Risk Framework and Global Funding Risk Framework documents. Both the policy and framework documents adhere to and articulate how the eight key risk management practices are applied to liquidity risk namely risk governance risk organization lines of defense risk culture risk appetite andstrategy risk identification andassessment risk mitigation and controls risk measurement and reporting stress planning andexecution. The individual roles and responsibilities are laid out and documented in the Global Responsibility Matrix which provides further clarity and transparency on the roles and responsibilities across all involved stakeholders. All additional policies and procedures both global and local issued by the liquidity risk management functions further define the requirements specific to liquidity risk practices. They are subordinate to the Liquidity Risk Management Policy and are subject to the standards it sets forth. In accordance with the European Central Banks Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process and revised Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process requirement issued in November the Group has implemented an Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process which is assessed documented and reviewed at least annually and approved by the Management Board. As part of an annual strategic planning process Treasury projects the development of the key liquidity and funding metrics including the U.S. Dollar currency exposure based on anticipated business activities to ensure that the strategic plan can be executed in accordance with the Groups risk appetite. ,,,,,,,,,,,0.5079914483875283,,,,,,,,

982, LoD within Deutsche Banks Three Lines of Defense LoD model. The Chief Security Officer has delegated authority from the Management Board and reports directly to the Chief Technology Data and Innovation Officer who is a member of the Management Board. Deutsche Banks Chief Security Officer has served in various roles in information security for more than years. This includes the role as global Chief Information Security Officer CISO Chief Security Officer CSO for three different large European financial institutions and a partner position in a global strategy and consulting firm leading security work for financial service clients. The Chief Security Officer is supported by information security role holders at various seniority levels to help ensure that security requirements are met from a regional divisional and technical perspective. All information security activities are overseen by two dedicated governance fora chaired by the Chief Security Officer the Group IT Security Council interface to the banks IT units and the Group Information Security Committee interface to the banks business and infrastructure divisions. Furthermore both fora oversee the information security posture of Deutsche Bank against defined targets the progress and performance of key information security deliverables the remediation status of information security related audit findings and current information security incidents. They also endorse the information security strategy and act as the highest escalation level within the Chief Security Office. The Chief Security Office develops the banks groupwide security strategy and oversees its implementation and operationalization globally via the organizational setup governance and implemented security policies.The security strategy is reviewed continually to address changes in the threat landscape technology the regulatory environment the banks corporate and IT strategy and other internal and external parameters. Deutsche Banks security strategy framework provides comprehensive and layered security controls. This framework is strengthened by a threatdriven approach to direct and adjust the security investment including the continual review and assessment of the maturity of the banks security implementation. The Chief Security Office maintains a comprehensive metrics and reporting framework underpinned by an extensive data set allowing for global regional and divisional views. Security metrics and reporting provided to the banks governance fora at all seniority levels support appropriate security risk awareness and decision taking. The Management Board receives a comprehensive quarterly information security risk posture report as well as ad hoc information if required. Furthermore the Chief Security Officer provides regular updates on material topics relating to security to the Supervisory Boards Committee responsible for Technology Data and Innovation. Information Security Risk is managed as an Operational Risk under the NonFinancial Risk Management Framework of the bank. The Chief Security Office in its responsibility as st LoD executes against the NonFinancial Risk Management Framework and leverages its various instruments e.g. an annual Risk Control Assessment whereas the NonFinancial Risk Management as second Line of Defense nd LoD provides oversight review and challenge. Accordingly part of the NonFinancial Risk Committees NFRC remit is to oversee and govern Deutsche Banks cybersecurity risk profile remediation programs and risk tolerance. Also nd LoD is represented in both st LoD fora described above. In alignment with its NonFinancial Risk Management policies Deutsche Banks security policy framework defines the core principles of security risk management and the fundamentals for security management. The complete framework is reviewed annually and any changes are endorsed by the Group Information Security Committee. The framework is governed centrally and applied globally across all product groups and business and infrastructure divisions. The framework includes a clear description of the risk tolerance related to information security. It also sets out the roles responsibilities and accountabilities of key personnel identified to manage information security risk the strategy and measures to cope with information security breaches and related communication procedure. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.32661139055112864,,,,,,
985,Deutsche Bank operates in an environment with increasing levels of digitization and a continually evolving landscape related to cybersecurity threats. Due to the dynamics and complexity of the current environment the bank is continuously monitoring the security threat landscape. The bank vigilantly observes technological developments the geopolitical landscape and economic impacts driving security risks and assesses their relevance for potential impacts to Deutsche Bank and the wider financial ecosystem. Deutsche Bank has a variety of prevention methods and controls in place such as threat intelligence data leakage prevention cyber hygiene and encryption solutions. These also include placing a strong emphasis on detection backed by a robust incidentresponse process. The bank actively shares best practices and threat information with national and international security organizations government authorities and peer organizations. These relationships help to ensure that the banks security technology and procedures reflect current industry best practices and keep pace with the threat environment. Deutsche Banks security incident management covers cybersecurity events that may affect the bank its clients business partners or employees. The related management and reporting processes performed with the involvement of Compliance Legal and Group Data Privacy are designed to enable a quick and effective response to cyberattacks and information security threats. The objective is to minimize loss leakage or disruption and to use insights gained from the handling of incidents to continuously improve the banks processes. The worldwide distributed Cyber Intelligence and Response Centers in AsiaPacific Europe and America allow detection of threats and response to incidents worldwide by operations. To address evolving security threats the bank continually reviews and enhances its information security controls into every layer of technology including identity and access management data infrastructure devices and applications. This is complemented by organizational controls and security training and awareness. The purpose of this layered approach is to provide endtoend protection as well as multiple opportunities to detect prevent respond to and recover from cyberthreats. Security risks are assessed on a regular basis at least annually taking internal as well as external risk drivers and events dynamically into account. A thorough analysis of the external threat landscape which leverages industry standard threat assessment frameworks provides a foundation for the assessment of financial industry relevant risk scenarios. These are evaluated against the banks capabilities to cope with these risks. In case of emerging developments additional risk reviews are conducted. As part of the annual risk and control assessment process subject matter experts provide a risk description and are supported by other areas such as Legal Compliance or Group Data Privacy as necessary. Senior information security experts from all divisions and functions assess the exposure of the Group based on their divisional or functional background. The process considers contextual data such as major events threat assessments findings scenario analysis control metrics lessons learned read across regulatory expectations and remediation activities when assessing control suites and residual risk positions. Measures for the further reduction of material residual risks may include policy changes or policy amendments at divisional or group level as well as prioritized investment and accelerated implementation of risk mitigating activities. Reliance on third parties products and services that support critical operations can affect the banks risk posture because these can be the target of new and evolving cybersecurity attacks. This risk along with expanded regulatory requirements has necessitated an increased use of technology to better identify information security risks across third parties and where necessary proactively perform outreach with them. Deutsche Bank manages third party information security risks by means of its global thirdparty risk management program. This program includes an information security policy specifically for third parties that sets forth the banks control objectives and expectations. Additionally Deutsche Bank has a thirdparty risk management process designed to identify monitor and mitigate risks arising from working with third parties which includes the banks oversight of third parties operations related to the services provided to the bank. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.32956703756232586,,,,,,

High emphasis is placed on structuring and pricing such transactions so that derisking can be achieved in a timely manner and where Deutsche Bank takes market price risk to mitigate such market risk. The Groups amortized cost loan exposure within above categories is mostly to good quality borrowers.

1169,The LTV expresses the amount of exposure as a percentage of the underlying real estate value. The Groups LTV ratios are calculated using the total exposure divided by the current determined value of the respective properties. These values are monitored and updated if necessary on a regular basis. The exposure of transactions that are additionally backed by liquid collateral is reduced by the respective collateral values whereas any prior charges increase the corresponding total exposure. The LTV calculation includes exposure which is secured by real estate collateral. Any mortgage lending exposure that is collateralized exclusively by any other type of collateral is not included in the LTV calculation. The creditors creditworthiness the LTV and the quality of collateral is an integral part of the Groups risk management when originating loans and when monitoring and steering the Groups credit risks. In general the Group is willing to accept higher LTVs the better the creditors creditworthiness is. Nevertheless restrictions of LTV apply e.g. for countries with negative economic outlook or expected declines of real estate values.

1365,The primary risks in financial reporting are that either financial statements do not present a true and fair view due to inadvertent or intentional errors fraud or the publication of financial statements is not performed on a timely basis. These risks may reduce investor confidence or cause reputational damage and may have legal consequences including banking regulatory interventions. A lack of fair presentation arises when one or more financial statement amounts or disclosures contain misstatements or omissions that are material. Misstatements are deemed material if they could individually or in aggregate influence economic decisions that users make because of the financial statements. To confine those risks of financial reporting management of the Group has established internal control over financial reporting with the aim of providing reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatements. In addition an assessment was conducted of the effectiveness of the Groups internal control over financial reporting. This was based on the Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. COSO recommends the establishment of specific objectives to facilitate the design and evaluate adequacy of a control system. As a result in establishing internal control over financial reporting management has adopted the following financial statement objectives Existence assets and liabilities exist and transactions have occurred Completeness all transactions are recorded and account balances are included in the financial statements Valuation assets liabilities and transactions are recorded in the financial statements at the appropriate amounts Rights Obligations and Ownership rights obligations and ownership are appropriately recorded as assets and liabilities Presentation and Disclosures classification disclosure and presentation of financial reporting is appropriate Safeguarding of assets unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of assets is prevented or detected in a timely manner. However any internal control system including internal control over financial reporting no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the objectives of that control system are met. As such disclosure controls and procedures or systems for internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors inadvertent or intentional errors fraud. Furthermore projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. In addition the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. ,,,,,,,,,,0.3298898455403087,,,,,,,,,

1553,Details on exposures and the impact on financial instrument impairment from the war in Ukraine can be found in the sections IFRS impairment and Exposure to Russia in the Risk Report. As of December the Group discontinued its disclosure relating to Market Risk to Russia Russian operations and Compliance and Anti Financial Crime risks. This considers the derisking efforts the Group has undertaken. The Group continues to monitor its risks related to Russia and Ukraine as part of its regular risk management activities and enhanced governance oversight in place. Disclosures on climate related risk can be found in the sections Enterprise Risk Management line item Environmental social and governance risk in the Risk Report. The Group is exposed to environmental social and governance ESG risk. The following are examples of how such risk may impact the financial results of the Group Increases in the frequency and severity of climate events could impact client ability to service principal and interest payments under instruments subject to IFRS . Failure to comply with environmental and social legislation may impact client ability to generate sustainable returns to service their loans. If in the future clients do not hold sufficient insurance for physical assets against certain risks e.g. flooding this may impact the value of collateral held against certain type of loans. The Group considers such ESG risk as part of the credit risk assessment and due diligence process before relevant clients are granted credit. The Group also manages its credit portfolio within the established risk appetite and limits. Further accounting considerations including risk consideration for ESG indexed loans can be found in the section Financial assets in the description of the material accounting policies below. These audited disclosures are marked in light blue in the Risk Report. ,,,,0.3224136903531704,0.33434581965849824,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1555,The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions for certain categories of assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from managements estimates. The Groups material accounting policies are described in Material Accounting Policies. Certain of the Groups accounting policies require critical accounting estimates that involve complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions some of which may be for matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change. Such critical accounting estimates could change from period to period and may have a material impact on the Groups financial condition changes in financial condition or results of operations. Critical accounting estimates could also involve estimates where management could have reasonably used another estimate in the current accounting period. The Group has identified the following material accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates Impairment of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income see Impairment of Loans and Provision for Offbalance Sheet Positions below Determination of fair value see Determination of Fair Value below Recognition of trade date profit see Recognition of Trade Date Profit below Impairment of loans and provisions for offbalance sheet positions see Impairment of Loans and Provision for Offbalance Sheet Positions below Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles see Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets below Recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets see Income Taxes below Accounting for legal and regulatory contingencies and uncertain tax positions see Provisions below ,,,0.3183320792299912,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1568,The Group presents interest income and expense calculated using the EIR method separately in the Groups consolidated statement of income. Commissions and fee income The Group applies the IFRS Revenue from Contracts with Customers fivestep revenue recognition model to the recognition of Commissions and Fee Income under which income must be recognized when control of goods and services is transferred hence the contractual performance obligations to the customer has been satisfied. Accordingly after a contract with a customer has been identified in the first step the second step is to identify the performance obligation or a series of distinct performance obligations provided to the customer. The Group must examine whether the service is capable of being distinct and is actually distinct within the context of the contract. A promised service is distinct if the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and the promise to transfer the service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The amount of income is measured on the basis of the contractually agreed transaction price for the performance obligation defined in the contract. If a contract includes a variable consideration the Group estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. Income is recognized in profit and loss when the identified performance obligation has been satisfied. The Group does not present information about its remaining performance obligations if it is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less. The Group determines the standalone selling price at contract inception of a distinct service underlying each performance obligation in the contract and allocates the transaction price in proportion to those standalone selling prices. The standalone selling price is the price at which DB would sell a promised service separately to a customer on an unbundled basis. The best evidence of a standalone selling price is the observable price of a service when the Group sells that service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. If the Group does not sell the service to a customer separately it estimates the standalone selling price at an amount using a suitable method for example in loan syndication transactions the Group applies the requirements for recognition of trade day profit and considers the price at which other market participants provide the same service on an unbundled basis. As such when estimating a standalone selling price the Group considers all information including market conditions that is reasonably available to it. In doing so the Group maximizes the use of observable inputs and applies estimation methods consistently in similar circumstances. The Group provides asset management services that give rise to asset management and performance fees and constitute a single performance obligation. The asset management and performance fee components are variable considerations such that at each reporting date the Group estimates the fee amount to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised services to the customer. The benefits arising from the asset management services are simultaneously received and consumed by the customer over time. The Group recognizes revenue over time by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation subject to the removal of any uncertainty as to whether it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized would occur or not. For the management fee component this is the end of the monthly or quarterly service period. For performance fees this date is when any uncertainty related to the performance component has been fully removed. Loan commitment fees related to commitments that are accounted for off balance sheet are recognized in commissions and fee income over the life of the commitment if it is unlikely that the Group will enter into a specific lending arrangement. If it is probable that the Group will enter into a specific lending arrangement the loan commitment fee is deferred until the origination of a loan and recognized as an adjustment to the loans effective interest rate. Commissions and Fee Income predominantly earned from services that are received and consumed by the customer over time Administration assets under management foreign commercial business loan processing and guarantees sundry other customer services. The Group recognizes revenue from these services over time by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation subject to the removal of any uncertainty as to whether it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized would occur or not. Commissions and Fee Income predominantly earned from providing services at a point in time or transactiontype services include other securities underwriting and advisory fees brokerage fees local payments foreign currency exchange business and intermediary fees. Expenses that are directly related and incremental to the generation of Commissions and Fee Income are presented net in Commissions and Fee Income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. This includes income and associated expense where the Group contractually owns the performance obligation i.e. as Principal in relation to the service that gives rise to the revenue and associated expense. In contrast it does not include situations where the Group does not contractually own the performance obligation and is acting as agent. The determination of whether the Group is acting as principal or agent is based on the contractual terms of the underlying service arrangement. The gross Commissions and Fee Income and Expense amounts are disclosed in Note Commissions and Fee Income. ,,,,,,0.3396333542328291,0.47098910086124796,0.36945046787918573,0.4007067341303914,,,0.3702396507960748,,0.42917020251644067,,,,,

1570,The Group classifies financial assets in line with the classification and measurement requirements of IFRS where financial assets are classified based on both the business model used for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset known as Solely Payments of Principal and Interest or SPPI. There are three business models available Hold to Collect Financial assets held with the objective to collect contractual cash flows. They are subsequently measured at amortized cost and are recorded in multiple lines on the Groups consolidated balance sheet. Hold to Collect and Sell Financial assets held with the objective of both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. They are recorded as Financial assets at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income on the Groups consolidated balance sheet. Other Financial assets that do not meet the criteria of either Hold to Collect or Hold to Collect and Sell. They are recorded as Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss on the Groups consolidated balance sheet. The assessment of business model requires judgment based on facts and circumstances upon initial recognition. As part of this assessment the Group considers quantitative factors e.g. the expected frequency and volume of sales and qualitative factors such as how the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the Groups key management personnel. In addition to taking into consideration the risks that affect the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model in particular the way in which those market and credit risks are managed and how managers of the business are compensated e.g. whether the compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected. This assessment results in an asset being classified in either a Hold to Collect Hold to Collect and Sell or Other business model. If the Group holds a financial asset either in a Hold to Collect or a Hold to Collect and Sell business model then an assessment at initial recognition to determine whether the contractual cash flows of the financial asset are Solely Payments of Principal and Interest on the principal amount outstanding is required to determine the financial asset classification. Contractual cash flows that are SPPI on the principal amount outstanding are consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Interest in a basic lending arrangement is consideration for the time value of money and the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time. It can also include consideration for other basic lending risks e.g. liquidity risk and costs e.g. administrative costs associated with holding the financial asset for a particular period of time and a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Where cash flows can change over time due to contingent events such as terms where the margin on a loan adjusts depending on the performance of the borrower on certain contractual ESG metrics the contingent event and cash flows are assessed to determine if the instrument cash flows are SPPI. The nature of the contingent event and the size of the possible change in cash flows are taken into account in this assessment on an absolute and relative basis compared to the overall coupon. Additionally as part of the SPPI assessment where the lending is nonrecourse in nature then further assessment is made to determine if the cash flows are consistent with SPPI which is dependent on the nature of the underlying the level of subordination and the contractual cash flows of the instrument held. The Group originates and purchases debt instruments from entities issuing multiple tranches of debt. Where these instruments meet the definition of a contractually linked instruments then further analysis is performed on the cash flows and credit risk exposure of the instrument held as well as the underlying collateral held at purchase and can be held in the future. ,,,0.3284984777977777,0.3290086936476405,0.37250114770455817,,0.4452018617530155,,,,0.5616652738004483,0.3565151272551797,0.3466783700421702,0.4373643192297961,,,,,
1572,Financial assets are classified at fair value through profit or loss if they are held in the Other business model because they are either held for trading or because they do not meet the criteria for Hold to Collect or Hold to Collect and Sell. In addition it includes financial assets that meet the criteria for Hold to Collect or Hold to Collect and Sell business model but the financial asset fails SPPI or where the Group designated the financial assets under the fair value option. Financial assets classified as Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in Net gains losses on financial assetsliabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Interest on interest earning assets such as trading loans and debt securities and dividends on equity instruments are presented in Interest and Similar Income. The Group applies trade date accounting to financial assets classified at fair value through profit or loss.Trading assets Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they have been originated acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing them in the near term or they form part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of shortterm profittaking. Trading assets include debt and equity securities derivatives held for trading purposes and trading loans. This also includes loan commitments that are allocated to the Other business model and that are presented as derivatives held for trading. ,0.30838588194476557,,0.34804816565412555,,0.3394745267111389,,0.45420584401921477,,,,0.5665385526212108,0.37581471590910165,,0.42581601746289494,,,,,
1573,Nontrading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit and loss The Group assigns any nontrading financial asset that does not fall into the Hold to Collect nor Hold to Collect and Sell business models into the Other business model and classifies them as NonTrading Financial Assets mandatory at Fair Value through Profit and Loss. This includes predominately reverse repurchase agreements which are managed on a fair value basis. Additionally any financial asset that falls into the Hold to Collect or Hold to Collect and Sell business models for which the contractual cash flow characteristics are not SPPI is classified by the Group as NonTrading Financial Assets Mandatory at Fair Value through Profit and Loss. Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss Certain financial assets that would otherwise be measured subsequently at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income may be designated at Fair Value through Profit or Loss if the designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency. The Group allows the fair value option to be designated only for those financial instruments for which a reliable estimate of fair value can be obtained. ,,,0.36128659759016113,,0.3462872236794317,,0.46052888100656014,,,,,0.37672818304974315,,,0.3405836757626465,,,,
1575,A financial asset shall be classified and measured at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income FVOCI if the financial asset is held in a Hold to Collect and Sell business model and the contractual cash flows are SPPI unless designated under the fair value option. The amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are recorded in net interest income. Realized gains and losses are reported in net gains losses on financial assets at FVOCI. Generally the weightedaverage cost method is used to determine the cost of FVOCI financial assets. The Group applies trade date accounting to financial assets classified at FVOCI. It is possible to designate nontrading equity instruments as FVOCI. However this category is expected to have limited usage by the Group and has not been used to date. ,,,,,,,,,,,0.5040292707351021,,,,,,,,
1576,A financial asset is classified and subsequently measured at amortized cost if the financial asset is held in a Hold to Collect business model and the contractual cash flows are SPPI. Under this measurement category the financial asset is measured at fair value at initial recognition. Subsequently the carrying amount is reduced for principal payments plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method. The financial asset is assessed for impairment under the IFRS expected credit loss model where provisions are recognized based on expectations of potential credit losses. The Groups impairment of financial instruments policy is described further in the section Impairment of Loans and Provision for OffBalance Sheet Positions IFRS . The Group applies settlement date accounting to financial assets measured at amortized cost. Financial Assets at amortized cost include predominately Loans at amortized cost Central bank funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements Securities borrowed and certain receivables presented in Other Assets. ,,,,,,,,,,,0.5003744261854396,,,,,,,,

1585,Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include Trading Liabilities Financial Liabilities Designated at Fair Value through Profit or Loss and NonParticipating Investment Contracts Investment Contracts. Under IFRS they are carried at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in net gains losses on financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. For financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit and loss the fair value movements attributable to the Groups own credit component for fair value movements is recognized in Other Comprehensive Income. The Group applies trade date accounting to financial liabilities classified at fair value through profit or loss. Interest on interest paying liabilities are presented in interest expense for financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss. Trading liabilities Financial liabilities that arise from debt issued are classified as held for trading if they have been originated or incurred principally for the purpose of repurchasing them in the near term. Trading liabilities consist primarily of derivative liabilities including certain loan commitments and short positions. This also includes loan commitments where the resulting loan upon funding is allocated to the other business model such that the undrawn loan commitment is classified as derivatives held for trading. Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss Certain financial liabilities that do not meet the definition of trading liabilities are designated at fair value through profit or loss using the fair value option. To be designated at fair value through profit or loss financial liabilities must meet one of the following criteria the designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency a group of financial liabilities is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy or the instrument contains one or more embedded derivatives unless a the embedded derivative does not significantly modify the cash flows that otherwise would be required by the contract or b it is clear with little or no analysis that separation is prohibited. In addition the Group allows the fair value option to be designated only for those financial instruments for which a reliable estimate of fair value can be obtained. Financial liabilities which are designated at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option include repurchase agreements loan commitments and structured note liabilities. ,0.28146956835206816,,0.3448148306570471,,,,0.43287705888667116,,,,0.5072607210216203,,,,,,,,
1586,Investment contracts All of the Groups investment contracts are unitlinked contracts that match specific assets held by the Group. The contracts oblige the Group to use these assets to settle investment contract liabilities. They do not contain significant insurance risk or discretionary participation features. The contract liabilities are determined using current unit prices multiplied by the number of units attributed to the contract holders as of the balance sheet date. As this amount represents fair value the liabilities have been classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Deposits collected under investment contracts are accounted for as an adjustment to the investment contract liabilities. Investment income attributable to investment contracts is included in the consolidated statement of Income. Investment contract claims reflect the excess of amounts paid over the account balance released. Investment contract policyholders are charged fees for policy administration investment management surrenders or other contract services. ,,,,,,0.3461206290027483,,,,,0.5204469427688816,0.38383797521663293,,,,,,,
1590,Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost include longterm and shortterm debt issued which are initially measured at fair value which is the consideration received net of transaction costs incurred. Repurchases of issued debt in the market are treated as extinguishments and any related gain or loss is recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income. A subsequent sale of own bonds in the market is treated as a reissuance of debt. The Group applies settlement date accounting to financial liabilities measured at amortized cost. ,,,,,0.3576343580607736,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1614,A financial asset is considered for derecognition when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or the Group has either transferred the contractual right to receive the cash flows from that asset or has assumed an obligation to pay those cash flows to one or more recipients subject to certain criteria. The Group derecognizes a transferred financial asset if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. The Group enters into transactions in which it transfers previously recognized financial assets but retains substantially all the associated risks and rewards of those assets for example a sale to a third party in which the Group enters into a concurrent total return swap with the same counterparty. These types of transactions are accounted for as secured financing transactions. ,,,,,,,,,,,0.4975457926997992,0.3545390125994249,,,,,,,
1617,Certain OTC derivative contracts and most exchangetraded futures and option contracts cleared through central clearing counterparties and exchanges have payment or receipt of variation margin on a daily basis that represents legal or economic settlement of the outstanding derivatives present value. This results in derecognition of the associated derivative financial asset and financial liabilities. ,,,,,,,,0.3683617173637753,,,,,,,,,,,
1619,Securities purchased under resale agreements reverse repurchase agreements and securities sold under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements are treated as collateralized financings and are recognized initially at fair value being the amount of cash disbursed and received respectively. The Group allocates reverse repurchase portfolios that are managed on a fair value basis to the other business model under IFRS and classifies them as Nontrading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss. Interest earned on reverse repurchase agreements and interest incurred on repurchase agreements is reported as interest income and interest expense respectively. ,,,,,,,0.41858959338885277,,,,,0.3760434933519282,,,,,,,
1621,Securities borrowed transactions generally require the Group to deposit cash with the securities lender. In a securities loaned transaction the Group generally receives either cash collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of the market value of securities loaned or securities. The securities borrowed are not themselves recognized in the financial statements. If they are sold to third parties the obligation to return the securities is recorded as a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss and any subsequent gain or loss is included in the Consolidated Statement of Income in net gains losses on financial assetsliabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Securities lent to counterparties are also retained on the Consolidated balance sheet. The Group records the amount of cash advanced or received as securities borrowed and securities loaned respectively in the Consolidated balance sheet. Fees received or paid are reported in interest income and interest expense respectively. Securities lent to counterparties which are not derecognized from the Consolidated balance sheet and where the counterparty has the right by contract or custom to sell or repledge the collateral are disclosed in Note Transfer of Financial Assets Assets Pledged and Received as Collateral. ,,,,,,,,,,,0.5003456350504623,0.36017220851380405,,,,,,,
1623,If goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and an operation within that unit is disposed of the attributable goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on its disposal. Corporate assets are allocated to a CGU when the allocation can be done on a reasonable and consistent basis. If this is not possible the individual CGU is tested without the corporate assets. They are then tested on the level of the minimum collection of CGUs to which they can be allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis. Intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights and their fair value can be measured reliably. Intangible assets that have a finite useful life are stated at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Customerrelated intangible assets that have a finite useful life are amortized over periods of between and years on a straightline basis based on their expected useful life. These assets are tested for impairment and their useful lives reaffirmed at least annually. Certain intangible assets have an indefinite useful life and hence are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized if it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group and the cost can be measured reliably. Capitalized costs are amortized using the straightline method over the assets useful life which is deemed to be either three five or ten years. Eligible costs include external direct costs for materials and services as well as payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees directly associated with an internaluse software project. Overhead costs as well as costs incurred during the research phase or after software is ready for use are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software costs are tested for impairment either annually if still under development or any time when there is an indication of impairment once the software is in use. Critical accounting estimates The determination of the recoverable amount in the impairment assessment of nonfinancial assets requires estimates based on quoted market prices prices of comparable businesses present value or other valuation techniques such as the cost approach or a combination thereof necessitating management to make subjective judgments and assumptions. Because these estimates and assumptions could result in significant differences to the amounts reported if underlying circumstances were to change the Group considers these estimates to be critical. The quantitative disclosures are provided in Note Goodwill and other intangible assets. ,,,0.31900217690379074,,0.36469301302246343,0.3434245660103165,,,,,,,0.3266411584025687,,,,,,
1624,Provisions are recognized if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events if it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation as of the balance sheet date taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party for example because the obligation is covered by an insurance policy an asset is recognized if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received. If the Group has a contract that is onerous the present obligation under the contract is recognized and measured as a provision. An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. Critical accounting estimates The use of estimates is important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings. The Group estimates and provides for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated in accordance with IAS Provisions Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the Groups final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. Contingencies in respect of legal matters are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance. Significant judgment is required in assessing probability and making estimates in respect of contingencies and the Groups final liability may ultimately be materially different. The Groups total liability in respect of litigation arbitration and regulatory proceedings is determined on a casebycase basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering among other factors the progress of each case the Groups experience and the experience of others in similar cases and the opinions and views of legal counsel. Predicting the outcome of the Groups litigation matters is inherently difficult particularly in cases in which claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages. See Note Provisions for further information on the uncertainties from the Groups judicial regulatory and arbitration proceedings. ,,,,,,,,,0.36292500153714347,,,,,,0.32985436787245326,,,,
1626,The Group recognizes the current and deferred tax consequences of transactions that have been included in the consolidated financial statements using the provisions of the respective jurisdictions tax laws. Current and deferred taxes are recognized in profit or loss except to the extent that the tax relates to items that are recognized directly in equity or other comprehensive income in which case the related tax is recognized either directly in equity or other comprehensive income accordingly. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases unused tax losses and unused tax credits. Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which those unused tax losses unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period that the asset is realized or the liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset when they arise from the same tax reporting entity or tax group of reporting entities the legally enforceable right to offset exists and they are intended to be settled net or realized simultaneously. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities exists and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxing authority on either the same tax reporting entity or tax group of reporting entities. Deferred tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries branches and associates and interests in joint ventures except when the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets are provided on deductible temporary differences arising from such investments only to the extent that it is probable that the differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and sufficient taxable income will be available against which those temporary differences can be utilized. Deferred tax related to fair value remeasurement of financial assets classified as FVTOCI cash flow hedges and other items which are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income is also credited or charged directly to other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income once the underlying transaction or event to which the deferred tax relates is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. For sharebased payment transactions the Group may receive a tax deduction related to the compensation paid in shares. The amount deductible for tax purposes may differ from the cumulative compensation expense recorded. At any reporting date the Group must estimate the expected future tax deduction based on the current share price. The associated current and deferred tax consequences are recognized as income or expense in the consolidated statement of Income for the period. If the amount deductible or expected to be deductible for tax purposes exceeds the cumulative compensation expense the excess tax benefit is recognized directly in equity. Critical accounting estimates In determining the amount of deferred tax assets the Group uses historical tax capacity and profitability information and if relevant forecasted operating results based upon approved business plans including a review of the eligible carryforward periods available tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. The analysis of the historical tax capacity includes the determination as to whether a period of past profits or a history of recent losses exists at the reporting date. The determination of a period of past profits or a history of recent losses is based on the pretax results adjusted for permanent differences and typically covers the current and the two preceding financial years. Each quarter the Group reevaluates its estimate related to deferred tax assets. The Group believes that the accounting estimate related to the deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period and requires significant management judgment. For example tax law changes changes in the historical tax capacity or variances in future projected operating performance could result in a change of the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset. If the Group was not able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to its deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense or directly to equity in the period such determination was made. If the Group was to recognize previously unrecognized deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to its deferred tax asset would be credited to income tax expense or directly to equity in the period such determination was made. ,,,,,,,0.4081126201700126,,,0.33651032001537995,,,,,,,,,
1631,Individual noncurrent assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if they are available for immediate sale in their present condition subject only to the customary sales terms of such assets and disposal groups and their sale is considered highly probable. For a sale to be highly probable management must be committed to a sales plan and be actively looking for a buyer and has no substantive regulatory approvals outstanding. Furthermore the assets and disposal groups must be actively marketed at a reasonable sales price in relation to their current fair value and the sale should be expected to be completed within one year. Noncurrent nonfinancial assets and disposal groups which meet the criteria for held for sale classification are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal and are presented within Other assets and Other liabilities in the balance sheet. Financial assets and liabilities meeting the criteria continue to be measured in accordance with IFRS .

1633,Property and equipment includes ownuse properties leasehold improvements furniture and equipment and software operating systems only. Rightofuse assets are presented together with property and equipment on the Groups consolidated balance sheet. Ownuse properties are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is generally recognized using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The range of estimated useful lives is to years for property and to years for furniture and equipment including initial improvements to purchased buildings. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and subsequently depreciated on a straightline basis over the shorter of the term of the lease and the estimated useful life of the improvement which generally ranges from to years. Depreciation of property and equipment is included in general and administrative expenses. Maintenance and repairs are also charged to general and administrative expenses. Gains and losses on disposals are included in other income. Property and equipment are assessed for any indication of impairment at each quarterly reporting date. If such indication exists the recoverable amount which is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use must be estimated and an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. After the recognition of impairment of an asset the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to reflect the assets revised carrying amount. If an impairment is later reversed the depreciation charge is adjusted prospectively. ,0.3247723160640807,0.30919359357365755,0.3427099776471337,0.3863741721413768,0.4517905881808359,0.41626247114015513,,0.3879145740329182,0.33559936905712673,,,0.5194132473867703,0.32595208092831285,,,,,,0.39101407883083117

1641,The Group enters into lease contracts predominantly for land and buildings as a lessee. Other categories are company cars and technicalIT equipment. In calculating the present value of lease payments the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification a change in the lease term or a change in the lease payments e.g. changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments. Rightofuse assets are assessed for any indication of impairment at each quarterly reporting date. If such indication exists the recoverable amount which is the fair value less costs of disposal must be estimated and an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount. As rightofuse assets do not have independently generated cash flows to calculate its value in use the Group considers any sublease income that could reasonably be earned. After the recognition of impairment of an asset the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to reflect the assets revised carrying amount. If an impairment is later reversed the depreciation charge is adjusted prospectively. ,,,,,0.36164696975618155,,,,,,,0.4374750154028976,,,,,,,
1642,The Group presents rightofuse assets in Property and Equipment and lease liabilities in Other Liabilities. The Group applies the shortterm lease recognition exemption to its shortterm leases i.e. those leases that have a lease term of months or less from the commencement date. It also applies the lease of lowvalue assets recognition exemption to leases of technicalIT equipment that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on shortterm leases and leases of low value assets are recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the lease term. ,,,0.31856662379470563,0.3704869275966392,,0.36577880702857013,,,0.4110777923308053,,,0.49672152678589904,,,,,,,
1647,In addition the Group maintains unfunded contributory postemployment medical plans for a number of current and retired employees who are mainly located in the United States. These plans pay stated percentages of eligible medical and dental expenses of retirees after a stated deductible has been met. The Group funds these plans on a cash basis as benefits are due. Analogous to retirement benefit plans these plans are valued using the projected unitcredit method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in full in the period in which they occur in other comprehensive income and presented in equity.

For share awards the fair value is the quoted market price of the share reduced by the present value of the expected dividends that will not be received by the employee and adjusted for the effect if any of restrictions beyond the vesting date. In case an award is modified such that its fair value immediately after modification exceeds its fair value immediately prior to modification a remeasurement takes place and the resulting increase in fair value is recognized as additional compensation expense. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.29253822326131196,,,
1652,The Group records the offsetting amount to the recognized compensation expense in additional paidin capital APIC. Compensation expense is recorded on a straightline basis over the period in which employees perform services to which the awards relate or over the period of the tranches for those awards delivered in tranches. Estimates of expected forfeitures are periodically adjusted in the event of actual forfeitures or for changes in expectations. The timing of expense recognition relating to grants which due to early retirement provisions include a nominal but nonsubstantive service period are accelerated by shortening the amortization period of the expense from the grant date to the date when the employee meets the eligibility criteria for the award and not the vesting date. For awards that are delivered in tranches each tranche is considered a separate award and amortized separately. Compensation expense for sharebased awards payable in cash is remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date and recognized over the vesting period in which the related employee services are rendered. The related obligations are included in other liabilities until paid. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.31293842422005175,,,
1656,The Group recognizes income from government grants when there is reasonable assurance that it will receive the grant and will comply with the conditions attached to the grant. The benefit is recognized in the period in which the grant is intended to compensate the Group for related costs and presented as a reduction of the related expense. The Group considered the initial benefits that arose from borrowing under TLTRO III as government grant from a belowmarket loan under IAS and recognized subsequent benefits in accordance IFRS . Since November all remaining TLTRO III operations are indexed to the average applicable key ECB interest rates. For further information on the benefit recognized by the Group from the TLTRO III refinancing program see Note Net interest income and net gains losses on financial assetsliabilities at fair value through profit or loss. ,,,,,,,,,,,,0.36175406230663604,,,,,,,
1660,For purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows the Groups cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Such investments include cash and balances at central banks and demand deposits with banks. There are various circumstances in which cash and cash equivalent balances held by an entity are not available for use by the Group. Examples include cash and cash equivalent balances held by a subsidiary that operates in a country where exchange controls or other legal restrictions apply such that the balances are not available for general use by the Group or its subsidiaries. The Groups assignment of cash flows to the operating investing or financing category depends on the business model management approach. For the Group the primary operating activity is to manage financial assets and financial liabilities. Therefore the issuance and management of longterm borrowings is a core operating activity which is different than for a nonfinancial company where borrowing is not a principal revenue producing activity and thus is part of the financing category. The Group views the issuance of senior longterm debt as an operating activity. Senior longterm debt comprises structured notes and assetbacked securities which are designed and executed by the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank business line segments and which are revenue generating activities. The other component is debt issued by Treasury which is considered interchangeable with other funding sources. All funding costs are allocated to business activities to establish their profitability. Cash flows related to subordinated longterm debt and trust preferred securities are viewed differently than those related to seniorlong term debt because they are managed as an integral part of the Groups capital primarily to meet regulatory capital requirements. As a result they are not interchangeable with other operating liabilities but can only be interchanged with equity and thus are considered part of the financing category. The amounts shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows do not precisely match the movements in the consolidated balance sheet from one period to the next as they exclude noncash items such as movements due to foreign exchange translation and movements due to changes in the group of consolidated companies. Movements in balances carried at fair value through profit or loss represent all changes affecting the carrying value. This includes the effects of market movements and cash inflows and outflows. The movements in balances carried at fair value are usually presented in operating cash flows. ,,0.313053666294427,0.32941373295932347,0.346336256480384,0.3950397386303162,0.3316049658895215,0.42872845306066804,,0.334882322566457,0.3341288978445094,0.5448144907884288,,,0.4334136650120074,,,,,
1666,IAS Income Taxes ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3315532136308277,,,
1667,On January the Group adopted amendments to IAS Income Taxes. These amendments changed the deferred tax treatment related to assets and liabilities in a single transaction such that they introduce an exemption from the initial recognition exemption provided in IAS .b and IAS .. Accordingly the initial recognition exemption does not apply to transactions in which both deductible and taxable temporary differences arise on initial recognition that result in the recognition of equal deferred tax assets and liabilities. Neither of these amendments had a material impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements. In December the Organization for Economic CoOperation and Development OECD issued Global AntiBase Erosion and Profit Shifting BEPS Rules under the Pillar Framework. In May the IASB issued amendments to IAS Income Taxes to introduce a mandatory temporary exception to the accounting for deferred taxes arising from the implementation of Pillar model rules and disclosure requirements. The application of the exception outlined above had to be applied immediately with the disclosure requirements to be effective for annual periods beginning on or after January . The mandatory temporary exception has been applied and there has been no impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements. ,,,0.31916326552432867,,,,0.417003800494191,,,0.3335748407231639,,,,,0.34586100282952326,0.3189146018878538,,,
1669,On January the Group adopted amendments to IAS and IFRS Practice Statement that are intended to provide guidance on deciding which accounting policies to disclose in financial statements. Accordingly an entity is now required to disclose its material accounting policies instead of its significant accounting policies. The amendments did not have an impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements. ,,,0.3299287975773412,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1673,In September the IASB issued amendments to IFRS Leases that clarify how a sellerlessee subsequently measures sale and leaseback transactions that satisfy the IFRS requirements to be accounted for as a sale. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January with early adoption permitted. The amendment is not expected to have a material impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements. ,,,,,,,,,,,,0.43235071601176184,,,,,,,
1674,In January and July the IASB issued amendments to IAS Presentation of Financial Statements Classification of Liabilities as Current or NonCurrent. The amendments clarify that the classification of liabilities as current or noncurrent should be based on rights that are in existence at the end of the reporting period. The amendments also clarify that the classification is unaffected by expectations about whether an entity will exercise its right to defer settlement of a liability and make clear that settlement refers to the transfer to the counterparty of cash equity instruments other assets or services. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January with early adoption permitted. They will not have a material impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements. In October the IASB issued a further amendment to IAS that modifies the requirements described above on how an entity classifies debt and other financial liabilities as current or noncurrent in particular circumstances. Accordingly it clarifies that only covenants with which an entity is required to comply on or before the reporting date affect the classification of a liability as current or noncurrent. In line with the previous amendments the new amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January with early adoption permitted. The amendments will not have a material impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements. ,,,0.3389205149037029,,,0.34050433313735085,0.4305537258009009,,,0.3599732463623333,,,,,0.35374847952395966,0.35162286948222,,,

1690,Deutsche Banks segmental information has been prepared in accordance with the management approach which requires presentation of the segments on the basis of the internal management reports of the entity which are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker which is the Deutsche Bank Management Board in order to assess the financial performance of the business segments and for allocating resources to the business segments. ,,0.3008239300400327,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1692,Deutsche Banks segment reporting follows the organizational structure as reflected in the Groups internal management reporting systems which are the basis for assessing the financial performance of the business segments and for allocating resources to them. The banks business operations are organized under the divisional structure comprising the following corporate divisions Corporate Bank Investment Bank Private Bank Asset Management Corporate Other The Group consists of the following reportable segments Corporate Bank Investment Bank Private Bank Asset Management and Corporate Other. Corporate Bank reports revenues in the categories Corporate Treasury Services Institutional Client Services and Business Banking. Investment Bank reports revenues in the categories Fixed Income Currency Sales Trading and Origination Advisory as well as Other. Private Bank reports revenues in the categories Private Bank Germany and International Private Bank. Within International Private Bank revenues are reported in the categories Wealth Management Bank for Entrepreneurs and Premium Banking. By year end International Private Bank materially completed the winddown of the majority of legacy assets and liabilities associated with Sal. Oppenheim. Remaining assets or liabilities are not expected to have material financial impacts going forward and will be included in the normal course of the client segment Wealth Management Bank for Entrepreneurs. The associated disclosure of specific revenues items was discontinued starting in the first quarter of . Asset Management reports revenues in the categories Management Fees Performance and Transaction Fees and Other. Corporate Other includes revenues costs and resources held centrally that are not allocated to the individual business segments as well as valuation and timing differences that arise on derivatives used to hedge the Groups balance sheet. These are accounting impacts and valuation losses are expected to be recovered over time as the underlying instruments approach maturity. In addition Corporate Other contains financial impacts of legacy portfolios previously reported as the Capital Release Unit. As announced in the Annual Report having fulfilled the Capital Release Units derisking and cost reduction mandate from through year end the Capital Release Unit ceased to be reported as a separate segment with effect from the first quarter of . The remaining portfolio resources and employees are reported within the Corporate Other segment. In line with the change the Core Bank which previously represented the Group excluding the Capital Release Unit ceased to be reported as of the first quarter of . In addition based on management decisions during the reporting period further divisional changes were introduced. The prior years segmental information is presented in the current structure. ,,0.28448120988006176,,,,,0.4133536550026137,,,,,,,0.4107793457682362,,,,,
1694,Segment reporting requires a presentation of the segment results based on management reporting methods including a reconciliation between the results of the business segments and the consolidated financial statements which is presented in the Segment results of operations section within this note. The information provided about each segment is based on internal management reporting about segment profit or loss assets and other information which is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker. ,,0.34685639801400703,,,,,,,,0.3280817050282928,,,,,,,,,
1695,Segment assets are presented in the Groups internal management reporting based on a consolidated view i.e. the amounts do not include intersegment balances. The Groups internal management reporting does not consider segment liabilities or interest expense separately. Similarly depreciation and amortization tax expenses and other comprehensive income are not presented separately internally and are therefore not disclosed here. NonIFRS compliant accounting methods used in the Groups management reporting represent either valuation or classification differences. The largest valuation differences relate to measurement at fair value in management reporting versus measurement at amortized cost under IFRS and to the recognition of trading results from own shares in revenues in management reporting in Investment Bank and in equity under IFRS. The major classification difference relates to noncontrolling interest which represents the net share of minority shareholders in revenues provision for credit losses noninterest expenses and income tax expenses. Noncontrolling interest is reported as a component of the profit before tax of the businesses in management reporting with a reversal in Corporate Other and a component of net income appropriation under IFRS. Since the Groups business activities are diverse in nature and its operations are integrated certain estimates and judgments have been made to apportion revenue and expense items among the business segments. The management reporting systems allocate the Groups external net interest income according to the value of funding consumed or provided by each business segments activities in accordance with the banks internal funds transfer pricing framework. Furthermore to retain comparability with those competitors that have legally independent units with their own equity funding the Group allocates a net notional interest benefit on its consolidated capital in line with each segments proportion of average shareholders equity. Management uses certain measures for equity and related ratios as part of its internal reporting system because it believes that these measures provide it with a useful indication of the financial performance of the business segments. The Group discloses such measures to provide investors and analysts with further insight into how management operates the Groups businesses and to enable them to better understand the Groups results. ,0.28249895646735795,0.3260925646084175,,0.3328523194627623,0.3673595072885797,,0.46549996284944367,,,0.3286232303001376,,,,0.44340928547238895,,,,,
1697,Shareholders equity is fully allocated to the Groups segments based on the regulatory capital demand of each segment. Regulatory capital demand reflects the combined contribution of each segment to the Groups Common Equity Tier CET ratio the Groups leverage ratio and the Groups capital loss under stress. Contributions in each of the three dimensions are weighted to reflect their relative importance and level of constraint for the Group. Contributions to the CET ratio and the leverage ratio are measured through riskweighted assets and leverage ratio exposure. The Groups capital loss under stress is a measure of the Groups overall economic risk exposure under a defined stress scenario. Goodwill and other intangible assets are directly attributed to the Groups segments in order to allow the determination of allocated tangible shareholders equity and the respective returns. Shareholders equity and tangible shareholders equity is allocated on a monthly basis and averaged across quarters and for the full year. ,,,,0.3341962340645036,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1699,As disclosed in the Annual Report the Group implemented the DriverBased Cost Management allocations from the first quarter of . The new methodology aims to provide greater transparency over the drivers of infrastructure costs and links costs more closely to service consumption by segments. This change did not affect the Groups costincome ratio and return on tangible equity metrics but does impact these per business segment. Therefore priorperiod information is presented in the current structure resulting in an increase in noninterest expenses corresponding decrease in profit before tax for Corporate Bank of million for Investment Bank of million for Private Bank of million for Asset Management of million with a corresponding decrease in noninterest expenses corresponding reduction in loss before tax for Corporate Other of million for the full year . ,,0.30688869164392557,,0.38462659952315825,,0.42996170517988713,,0.46236779242526876,,,,,,,,,,,
1705,In the third quarter of approximately FTEs moved from Corporate Other to the operating business segments driven by the banks decision that the Chief Operating Office will no longer be a separate Management Board function. Accordingly businessrelated parts of Chief Operating Office that support the Investment Bank and the Corporate Bank which were previously run in Infrastructure moved to those divisions. Comparative segmental financial information is presented accordingly. This change did not result in a material financial impact at a segment level as costs are allocated from Corporate Other to the operating business segments that are using the service of the respective infrastructure functions and with this move the costs are directly incurred by the divisions rather than being charged to Corporate Other. ,,0.32526513185904543,,0.39786633472263205,0.35495528344680893,0.3281546866561311,0.4448490714760397,0.3943694878879567,,,0.5312540316424732,,,0.5247356941482333,,,,0.2583793891771028,0.38259816189606

1737,Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied. Performance obligation is satisfied by fund performance exceeding a hurdle rate an agreed minimum annual return provided to investors. As of December there were performance obligations to be satisfied of million with a time band of three years from to as of December million with a time band of three years from to from Alternative funds. The decrease of performance obligations to be satisfied was mainly driven by decline in the real estate valuations due to market conditions. As of December and December the Groups balance of receivables from commission and fee income was million and million respectively. As of December and December the Groups balance of contract liabilities associated to commission and fee income was million and million respectively. Contract liabilities arise from the Groups obligation to provide future services to a customer for which it has received consideration from the customer prior to completion of the services. The balances of receivables and contract liabilities do not vary significantly from period to period reflecting the fact that they predominately relate to recurring service contracts with service periods of less than one year such as monthly current account services and quarterly asset management services.

1774,The Group has designated various lending relationships at fair value through profit or loss. Lending facilities consist of drawn loan assets and undrawn irrevocable loan commitments. The maximum exposure to credit risk on a drawn loan is its fair value. The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk on drawn loans was million and million as of December and respectively. Exposure to credit risk also exists for undrawn irrevocable loan commitments and is predominantly counterparty credit risk. The credit risk on the securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed designated under the fair value option is mitigated by the holding of collateral. The valuation of these instruments considers the credit enhancement in the form of the collateral received. As such there is no material movement during the year or cumulatively due to movements in counterparty credit risk on these instruments. ,,,,,,,,,,,,0.374346380363977,,,,,,,

1807,Some of the financial assets and financial liabilities in Level of the fair value hierarchy have identical or similar offsetting exposures to the unobservable input. However according to IFRS they are required to be presented gross. Trading Securities Certain illiquid emerging market corporate bonds and illiquid highly structured corporate bonds are included in this level of the hierarchy. In addition some of the holdings of notes issued by securitization entities commercial and residential MBS collateralized debt obligation securities and other ABS are reported here. The increase in the period is driven by purchases and issuances gains and net transfers between Level and Level due to changes in the observability of input parameters used to value these instruments partially offset by sales and settlements. ,,,,,,,0.4188718763730231,,,,,,,,,,,,
1808,Positive and Negative Market Values from Derivative Instruments categorized in this level of the fair value hierarchy are valued based on one or more significant unobservable parameters. The unobservable parameters may include certain correlations certain longerterm volatilities certain prepayment rates credit spreads and other transactionspecific parameters. Level derivatives include certain options where the volatility is unobservable certain basket options in which the correlations between the referenced underlying assets are unobservable longerterm interest rate option derivatives multicurrency foreign exchange derivatives and certain credit default swaps for which the credit spread is not observable. The decrease in assets during the period are driven by net transfers between Level and Level due to changes in the observability of input parameters used to value these instruments and settlements partially offset by gains. The decrease in liabilities during the period are driven by net transfers between Level and Level due to changes in the observability of input parameters used to value these instruments and settlements partially offset by losses. Other Trading Instruments classified in Level of the fair value hierarchy mainly consist of traded loans valued using valuation models based on one or more significant unobservable parameters. The increase in the period is driven by purchases and issuances net transfers between Level and Level due to changes in the observability of input parameters used to value these instruments and gains partially offset by sales and settlements. Nontrading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or lossclassified in Level of fair value hierarchy include any nontrading financial asset that does not fall into the Hold to Collect nor Hold to Collect and Sell business models. This includes predominately reverse repurchase agreements which are managed on a fair value basis. Additionally any financial asset that falls into the Hold to Collect or Hold to Collect and Sell business models for which the contractual cash flow characteristics are not SPPI. The decrease in the period is driven by settlements and sales net transfers between Level and Level due to changes in the observability of input parameters used to value these instruments and losses partially offset by purchases and issuances.Financial AssetsLiabilities designated at Fair Value through Profit or Loss Certain corporate loans and structured liabilities which were designated at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option were categorized in this level of the fair value hierarchy. The corporate loans are valued using valuation techniques which incorporate observable credit spreads recovery rates and unobservable utilization parameters. Revolving loan facilities are reported in the third level of the hierarchy because the utilization in the event of the default parameter is significant and unobservable. In addition certain hybrid debt issuances designated at fair value through profit or loss containing embedded derivatives are valued based on significant unobservable parameters. These unobservable parameters include single stock volatility correlations. The decrease in assets during the period is driven by settlements. The increase in liabilities during the period is driven by issuances and losses partially offset by net transfers between Level and Level due to changes in the observability of input parameters used to value these instruments and settlements. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income include nonperforming loan portfolios where there is no trading intent and the market is very illiquid.

1929,The Group could retain some exposure to the future performance of a transferred asset either through new or existing contractual rights and obligations and still be eligible to derecognize the asset. This ongoing involvement will be recognized as a new instrument which may be different from the original financial asset that was transferred. Typical transactions include retaining senior notes of nonconsolidated securitizations to which originated loans have been transferred financing arrangements with structured entities to which the Group has sold a portfolio of assets or sales of assets with creditcontingent swaps. The Groups exposure to such transactions is not considered to be significant as any substantial retention of risks associated with the transferred asset will commonly result in an initial failure to derecognize. Transactions not considered to result in an ongoing involvement include normal warranties on fraudulent activities that could invalidate a transfer in the event of legal action qualifying passthrough arrangements and standard trustee or administrative fees that are not linked to performance. ,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3780108509889734,,,,,,,

1970,The Group determines the recoverable amounts of its primary CGUs on the basis of the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal Level of the fair value hierarchy. It employs a discounted cash flow DCF model which reflects the specifics of the banking business and its regulatory environment. The model calculates the present value of the estimated future earnings that are distributable to shareholders after fulfilling the respective regulatory capital requirements. The recoverable amounts also include the fair value of the AT Notes which are allocated to the primary CGUs. The DCF model uses earnings projections and respective capitalization assumptions based on fiveyear financial plans as well as longer term expectations on the impact of regulatory developments which are discounted to their present value. Estimating future earnings and capital requirements involves judgment and the consideration of past and current performances as well as expected developments in the respective markets and in the overall macroeconomic and regulatory environments. Earnings projections beyond the initial fiveyear period are where applicable adjusted to derive a sustainable level. In case of a going concern the cash flow to equity is assumed to increase by or converge towards a constant longterm growth rate for the Asset Management CGU of up to . up to .. This is based on projected revenue forecasts of the CGU as well as expectations for the development of gross domestic product and inflation and is captured in the terminal value. ,,,,,0.3382045622781341,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2017,Operational Risk Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events. The definition used for the purposes of determining operational provisions differs from the risk management definition as it excludes risk of loss resulting from civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters. For risk management purposes operational risk includes legal risk as payments to customers counterparties and regulatory bodies in civil litigations or regulatory enforcement matters constitute loss events for operational shortcomings but excludes business and reputational risk. Civil Litigation provisions arise out of current or potential claims or proceedings alleging noncompliance with contractual or other legal or regulatory responsibilities which have resulted or may result in demands from customers counterparties or other parties in civil litigations. Regulatory Enforcement provisions arise out of current or potential claims or proceedings alleging noncompliance with legal or regulatory responsibilities which have resulted or may result in an assessment of fines or penalties by governmental regulatory agencies selfregulatory organizations or other enforcement authorities. Restructuring provisions arise out of restructuring activities. The Group aims to enhance its longterm competitiveness through major reductions in costs duplication and complexity in the years ahead. For details see Note Restructuring. Other provisions include several specific items arising from a variety of different circumstances including the provision for the reimbursement of loan processing fees deferred sales commissions provisions for bank levies and mortgage repurchase demands. ,,,0.3368421409218091,0.33125734906951404,0.33698511262428155,,0.4092729326149343,,,,,,,0.41073536955303447,0.3701157969415223,,,,

2040,In the course of its business the Group regularly applies for and receives government support by means of Export Credit Agency ECA guarantees covering transfer and default risks for the financing of exports and investments into Emerging Markets and to a lesser extent developed markets for Structured Trade Export Finance and short and mediumterm Trade Finance business. Almost all exportoriented states have established such ECAs to support their domestic exporters. The ECAs act in the name and on behalf of the government of their respective country and are either constituted directly as governmental departments or organized as private companies vested with the official mandate of the government to act on its behalf. Terms and conditions of such ECA guarantees are broadly similar due to the fact that most of the ECAs act within the scope of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD consensus rules. The OECD consensus rules an intergovernmental agreement of the OECD member states define benchmarks intended to ensure that a fair competition between different exporting nations will take place. In some countries dedicated funding programs with governmental support are offered for ECAcovered financings. The Group makes use of such programs to assist its clients in the financing of exported goods and services. In certain financings the Group also receives government guarantees from national and international governmental institutions as collateral to support financings in the interest of the respective governments. The majority of such ECA guarantees received by the Group were issued either by the EulerHermes S.A. acting on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany by the Atradius Credito y Caucion S.A. de Seguros y Reaseguros acting on behalf of the Kingdom of Spain or by the Korea Trade Insurance Corporation acting on behalf of the Republic of Korea. ,,,,,,,0.45626940913375386,0.3796889425854467,,,,,,,0.329271499852579,,,,

2344,The Group engages in various business activities with structured entities which are designed to achieve a specific business purpose. A structured entity is one that has been set up so that any voting rights or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity. An example is when voting rights relate only to administrative tasks and the relevant activities are directed by contractual arrangements. A structured entity often has some or all of the following features or attributes Restricted activities A narrow and welldefined objective Insufficient equity to permit the structured entity to finance its activities without subordinated financial support Financing in the form of multiple contractually linked instruments to investors that create concentrations of credit or other risks tranches The principal uses of structured entities are to provide clients with access to specific portfolios of assets and to provide market liquidity for clients through securitizing financial assets. Structured entities may be established as corporations trusts or partnerships. Structured entities generally finance the purchase of assets by issuing debt and equity securities that are collateralized by andor indexed to the assets held by the structured entities. The debt and equity securities issued by structured entities may include tranches with varying levels of subordination. Structured entities are consolidated when the substance of the relationship between the Group and the structured entities indicate that the structured entities are controlled by the Group as discussed in Note Material Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates. ,,,,0.3224223275142551,,,,,,,,0.3539045630873252,,,,,,,
2349,Third party funding entities The Group provides funding to structured entities that hold a variety of assets. These entities may take the form of funding entities trusts and private investment companies. The funding is collateralized by the asset in the structured entities. The groups involvement involves predominantly both lending and loan commitments. The vehicles used in these transactions are controlled by the borrowers where the borrowers have the ability to decide whether to post additional margin or collateral in respect of the financing. In such cases where borrowers can decide to continue or terminate the financing the borrowers will consolidate the vehicle. Securitization Vehicles The Group establishes securitization vehicles which purchase diversified pools of assets including fixed income securities corporate loans and assetbacked securities predominantly commercial and residential mortgagebacked securities and credit card receivables. The vehicles fund these purchases by issuing multiple tranches of debt and equity securities the repayment of which is linked to the performance of the assets in the vehicles. The Group may transfer assets to these securitization vehicles and provides financial support to these entities in the form of liquidity facilities. The Group also invests and provides liquidity facilities to third party sponsored securitization vehicles. The securitization vehicles that are not consolidated into the Group are those where the Group does not hold the power or ability to unilaterally remove the servicer or special servicer who has been delegated power over the activities of the entity. Funds The Group establishes structured entities to accommodate client requirements to hold investments in specific assets. The Group also invests in funds that are sponsored by third parties or the bank may act as fund manager custodian or some other capacity and provide funding and liquidity facilities to both bank sponsored and third party funds. The funding provided is collateralized by the underlying assets held by the fund. The Group does not consolidate funds when Deutsche Bank is deemed agent or when another third party investor has the ability to direct the activities of the fund. Other These are Deutsche Bank sponsored or third party structured entities that do not fall into any criteria above. These entities are not consolidated by the Group when the bank does not hold power over the decision making of these entities. Income derived from involvement with structured entities The Group earns management fees and occasionally performancebased fees for its investment management service in relation to funds. Interest income is recognized on the funding provided to structured entities. Any trading revenue as a result of derivatives with structured entities and from the movements in the value of notes held in these entities is recognized in Net gainslosses on financial assetsliabilities held at fair value through profit and loss. Interests in unconsolidated structured entities The Groups interests in unconsolidated structured entities refer to contractual and noncontractual involvement that exposes the bank to variability of returns from the performance of the structured entities. Examples of interests in unconsolidated structured entities include debt or equity investments liquidity facilities guarantees and certain derivative instruments in which the Group is absorbing variability of returns from the structured entities. Interests in unconsolidated structured entities exclude instruments which introduce variability of returns into the structured entities. For example when the bank purchases credit protection from an unconsolidated structured entity whose purpose and design is to pass through credit risk to investors the bank is providing the variability of returns to the entity rather than absorbing variability. The purchased credit protection is therefore not considered as an interest for the purpose of the table below. Maximum exposure to unconsolidated structured entities The maximum exposure to loss is determined by considering the nature of the interest in the unconsolidated structured entity. The maximum exposure for loans and trading instruments is reflected by their carrying amounts in the consolidated balance sheet. The maximum exposure for derivatives and offbalance sheet commitments such as guarantees liquidity facilities and loan commitments under IFRS as interpreted by Deutsche Bank is reflected by the notional amounts. Such amounts or its development do not reflect the economic risks faced by the Group because it does not take into account the effects of collateral or hedges nor the probability of such losses being incurred. At December the notional related to the positive and negative replacement values of derivatives and off balance sheet commitments were billion billion and billion respectively. At December the notional related to the positive and negative replacement values of derivatives and off balance sheet commitments were billion billion and billion respectively. ,,,,0.3667866380399117,,,,0.3729292071263257,0.3439824439380776,,0.5469665012376935,0.38133139386437365,,,,,,,
2351,The Group provides a different measure for size of structured entities depending on their type. The following measures have been considered as appropriate indicators for evaluating the size of structured entities Funds Net asset value or assets under management where the bank holds fund units and notional of derivatives when the banks interest comprises of derivatives Securitizations notional of notes in issue excluding interest only and excess notes where applicable when the Group derives its interests through notes its holds and notional of derivatives when the banks interests is in the form of derivatives Third party funding entities Total assets in entities Repackaging and investment entities Fair value of notes in issue For third party funding entities size information is not publicly available therefore the Group has disclosed the greater of the collateral receivedpledged or the notional of the exposure the bank has to the entity. Based on the above definitions the total size of structured entities is billion of which the majority of billion is from Funds. In it was billion and billion respectively. The following table shows by type of structured entity the carrying amounts of the Groups interests recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position as well as the maximum exposure to loss resulting from these interests. The carrying amounts presented below do not reflect the true variability of returns faced by the Group because they do not take into account the effects of collateral or hedges. ,,,,,,,,,,,0.5099801438203029,,,,,,,,

2356,Total trading assets as of December and December of . billion and . billion are comprised primarily of . billion and . billion in securitizations and . billion and . billion in funds structured entities respectively. The Groups interests in securitizations are collateralized by the assets contained in these entities. Where the Group holds fund units these are typically in regard to market making in funds or otherwise serve as hedges for notes issued to clients. Moreover the credit risk arising from loans made to third party funding structured entities is mitigated by the collateral received. Nontrading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss includes reverse repurchase agreements to funds which comprise the majority of the interests in this category and are collateralized by the underlying securities. Loans as of December and December consist of . billion and . billion investment in securitization tranches and financing to third party funding entities. The Groups financing to third party funding entities is collateralized by the assets in those structured entities. Other assets as of December and December of . billion and . billion respectively consist primarily of cash margin balances. Pending Receivable balances are not included in this disclosure note due to the fact that these balances arise from typical customer supplier relationships out of e.g. brokerage type activities and their inherent volatility would not provide users of the financial statements with effective information about Deutsche Banks exposures to structured entities. ,,,,0.33123636472402873,,,0.4288983528623026,0.3802921628281201,,,0.5534811483510477,,,0.4013373742404622,,,,,

2603,The respective Management Board members functional responsibilities are linked with predefined key financial figures and nonfinancial targets from up to three categories. The three categories are A total of Key Performance Indicators KPIs are assigned to these categories of which a set of to KPIs are embedded in each individual Balanced Scorecard depending on the Management Board members area of functional responsibility. The methodology for the Balanced Scorecards has been further developed since their introduction in and adjusted to meet the developing focus. For example in order to foster Environmental Social and Governance ESG aspects in the compensation system ESG topics have been given an even greater consideration since in the Balanced Scorecards and also in the LongTerm Award LTA. The KPIs within the individual categories are set at the beginning of the year for each Management Board member individually along with corresponding targets thresholds and assessment parameters. In addition a weighting is set for each category. The weightings that the individual categories have within the overall Balanced Scorecard can be up to depending on the functional responsibility of the Management Board member. The KPIs of the Balanced Scorecards are measured continuously throughout the year but the overall assessment is made at the end of the year. The calculation logic for determining the final levels of achievement for each Management Board member is as follows In a first step the achievement band of each KPI is determined. If a minimum threshold value is not reached the achievement level for this KPI is set at zero. Once a maximum limit for a KPI has been reached the achievement level is set at . For a clear overview the Balanced Scorecard shows if each individual KPI was fulfilled or exceeded based on the defined assessment criteria green or only achieved to less than amber or not achieved red.

2652,The Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions InstitutsVergV generally stipulates a threeyear assessment period for the determination of the variable compensation for Management Board members. Deutsche Bank complies with this requirement by assessing each of the objectives of the LongTerm Award LTA over a threeyear period. If the relevant three years cannot be attributed to a member of the Management Board because the member joined the Bank only recently the achievement level for the objectives will be determined for the period that can be attributed to the member. The deferral period for the LTA is in principle five years. If the assessment period is shorter than the prescribed minimum the deferral period of the variable compensation to be granted is extended by the number of years missing for the minimum assessment period. The ShortTerm Award STA has an assessment period of one year. The deferral period for the STA is in principle seven years. The LongTerm Award LTA is granted in the form of sharebased instruments Restricted Equity Awards REAs. The REAs vest over a deferral period of years in tranches beginning with a tranche of in year and three tranches of each in year and following the grant of the variable compensation grant date. Subsequent to the grant date the REAs of each tranche are subject to an additional holding period of one year. Accordingly the Management Board members cannot dispose of the shares underlying the REAs until after years at the earliest and in full until after years following the grant date. During the deferral and holding periods the value of the REAs is linked to the performance of the Deutsche Bank share and is therefore tied to the longterm performance of the Bank and thereby strengthens the alignment of the Management Board members incentives to Deutsche Banks performance. The ShortTerm Award STA is generally granted in the form of deferred cash compensation Restricted Incentive Awards RIAs. The STA is paid out in four tranches of each over a total period of seven years in year and following the grant date. However if the STA accounts for more than of the total variable compensation the portion exceeding is also granted in the form of Restricted Equity Awards REAs. This ensures that at least of the total variable compensation is always granted in a sharebased form in accordance with the regulatory requirements. The portion exceeding is subject to the same deferral rules as the sharebased compensation from the LTA. Instead of receiving Restricted Equity Awards REAs and Restricted Incentive Awards RIAs as described above holders of specific functions at certain Deutsche Bank U.S. entities are required by applicable regulation to be compensated under different plans. Restricted compensation for these persons consists of restricted share awards and restricted cash awards. The recipient becomes the beneficial owner of the awards as of the Award Date and the awards are held on the recipients behalf. These awards are restricted for a period of time subject to the applicable plan rules and award statements including performance conditions and forfeiture provisions. The restriction period is aligned to the retention periods applicable to Deutsche Banks usual deferred awards. With regard to the Management Board members these rules apply to Stefan Simon due to his role as CEO of Deutsche Bank USA Corp. If a member of the Management Board is identified as Senior Management Function SMF holder by the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA in the UK specific deferral provisions under UK regulation in principle apply. Fabrizio Campelli was identified as SMF holder for variable compensation purposes due to his oversight responsibility for the UK region. In it was agreed with the PRA that the proportion of the variable compensation which corresponds to the time spent for this regional oversight responsibility is subject to the deferral provisions under UK regulation. Therefore of his variable compensation is deferred in line with the UK regulation i.e. is granted in Restricted Incentive Awards RIAs and paid out in two equal tranches in year and following the grant date and is granted in Restricted Equity Awards REAs and vests in equal tranches in year and following the grant date. After the vesting each tranche is subject to an additional holding period of one year. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.30110440257137605,,,

2674,The Supervisory Board allocates an entitlement to pension plan benefits to the Management Board members. These entitlements involve a pension plan with predefined contributions. Under this pension plan a personal pension account is set up for each participating member of the Management Board with effect from the start of office as a Management Board member. The members of the Management Board including the Management Board Chairman receive a uniform contractually defined fixed annual contribution amount of . The contribution accrues interest that is credited in advance and determined by means of an agerelated factor up to the age of . For entitlements from a firsttime or renewed appointment starting from the financial year interest accrues at an average rate of per annum for legacy entitlements . From the age of onwards an additional contribution equal to the amount resulting from applying the above interest rate to the balance of the pension account as of December of the previous year will be credited to the pension account. The annual contributions taken together form the pension capital amount available to pay the future pension benefits upon the occurrence of a pension event retirement age disability or death. The pension account balance is vested from the start. If a Management Board member is subject to nonGerman income tax the granting of an annual pension cash allowance of may be selected as an alternative to the pension plan entitlement. This is subject to the precondition that receiving the customary pension plan contributions entails not insignificant taxrelated disadvantages for the Management Board member compared to receiving a pension allowance. This option can be exercised once and from then on applies to the entire term of office of the Management Board member. The following table shows the annual contributions the interest credits the account balances and the annual service costs for the years and as well as the corresponding defined benefit obligations for each member of the Management Board in office in as of December and December .
