71,On April the written proposed resolution on the approval of Dagmar Steinerts secondary employment as a member of the Supervisory Board of iG Nyrt. was approved by circulation in favor. In addition to the reports from the committees and the general business position the meeting on May focused on the IT incident in the civilian business the further implications of this and the accompanying communication. We also unanimously approved Dagmar Steinerts secondary employment as an ordinary member of the Regional Advisory Board West of Commerzbank AG and dealt with preparations for the virtual Annual General Meeting on May . On August the general business position was discussed in detail. We then addressed three significant unplanned growth investments in with implications for the investment framework plan and the consequences for the OFCF. Finally we unanimously approved the investment measures to increase capacities for artillery tank ammunition and fuses at the ammunition plant in Vrpalota Hungary the investment in the plant for the production of F center fuselages and in addition the investment in Szeged for the production of NanoLam products under license from Polycharge. We also approved the consequences of these unplanned growth investments for the OFCF. The OFCF target value was thus adjusted for the shortterm incentive STI for fiscal due to the amended investment action plan. Other topics included the declaration of compliance in accordance with section of the German Stock Corporation Act AktG and the presentation of the auditors certificate on the audit of the system for compliance with the requirements arising from section of the German Securities Trading Act WpHG EMIR. The IT incident and the consequences thereof determined the discussion of current IT issues. The timetable for the integration of IT for all divisions was also discussed. At the meeting on October we dealt with the results of the Supervisory Boards efficiency review. Following the presentation of the revision of the Executive Board remuneration system and the adjustment of Executive Board remuneration from January the respective proposed resolutions were adopted unanimously. Further unanimous resolutions were passed on the adjustment of the basic amounts and the topup contribution to the pension plan for members of the Executive Board from January and on the review of the customary level of remuneration for the Supervisory Board.

74,The Strategy Technology and ESG Committeemet in March and November in the year under review. The general external conditions presented by the Executive Board and the associated challenges and potential disruptions were discussed at length. Topics that were addressed in depth included relevant marketrelated and technological trends that hold potential for further profitable growth the expansion of strategic core areas of expertise and technological positions potential new areas of business initiatives for expansion into emerging markets and regions and the future positioning of the divisions and the resulting targets and measures. In particular the current events in Ukraine and their effects were also discussed in depth. The possibilities for support from the industry for the German government were still of interest here. Other topics included the potential for Rheinmetall arising from requirements communicated by the German armed forces and whether sufficient production capacity was available or could be further expanded. In addition the fundamental planning and procurement process of the German armed forces was addressed as well as the impact on the companys civilian divisions with regard to raw material imports international supply chains and rising raw material and energy prices. In addition the Executive Board looked at the findings of internal strategy meetings with the individual divisions. The strategic and business alignment of the divisions and the courses of action to be derived from this were presented in detail. The strategic highlights were also presented as well as the resulting growth plans and financial targets at division level. In addition an update was provided on new strategic directions in the civilian sector and in particular on the merger of the divisions that are primarily active in the civilian sector into a new Power Systems division. The aim of merging these divisions is to strengthen the civilian business increase business relevance within the Rheinmetall Group and achieve synergy effects. In the past fiscal year the Audit Committee met in January March May August November and December. In addition to a preparatory examination of the singleentity and consolidated financial statements on which it issued a recommendation to the plenary assembly of the Supervisory Board on the passing of a resolution in accordance with section of the German Stock Corporation Act it dealt in particular with the monitoring of the accounting process the effectiveness and further development of the internal control system including the sustainabilityrelated internal control system the risk management system the internal auditing system and the compliance management system including data protection management. Prior to their publication the quarterly and semiannual results were discussed in detail with the Executive Board. The auditors of the financial statements participated in the Audit Committee meetings in March and December . In addition to dealing with specific individual issues in the divisions other topics discussed at the meetings included reports on IT transformation and the IT security concept in particular with regard to the IT incident in the divisions operating in the civilian environment and the resulting implications for the future. The members also dealt with the selfevaluation of the Audit Committee and compliance activities in the Rheinmetall Group. The committees selfevaluation revealed a good overall position. Individual members will continue to deepen their expertise in the area of sustainability reporting and Rheinmetallspecific topics through qualified measures. The key audit areas in were characterized as largely stable compared with the previous year. Other topics discussed in this context were Rheinmetalls control system the status of IT controls and hedge accounting and the new requirements for the nonfinancial statement. Furthermore the members of the Audit Committee looked at the material organizational and oversight duties required of companies with respect to related party transactions under ARUG II. The members were also informed by the Executive Board about the current state of affairs regarding major projects that are in the bidding and performance phase. Furthermore the members of the Audit Committee discussed the status of preparations for the Annual General Meeting to be held on May and the dividend proposal. The Audit Committee also made a decision concerning agreements with the auditor specifically the audit engagement setting focal points of the audit and arranging fees. The Executive Board provided information regularly on the scope of nonauditing services. ,,,,0.3566003207014078,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,The members of the Audit Committee also discussed the working capital liquidity and financing situation of the Rheinmetall Group and the implications arising from the war in Ukraine as well as supply bottlenecks in certain sectors. At meetings during the year the members of the Audit Committee were also informed by managers at the company about the Groups legal function corporate social responsibility CSR compliance and tax compliance risk management and internal auditing within the Rheinmetall Group. Along with the standard processes put in place individual topics within these areas were also discussed. The members of the Audit Committee gained a more indepth picture of existing structures and organizations workflows and rules and had the opportunity to ask questions about and comment on developments that were presented and the planned improvement measures in these areas. As a result the Audit Committee has not become aware of any circumstances that speak against the appropriateness and effectiveness of these systems as a whole. The Audit Committee satisfied itself that the company reviews the systems on an ongoing basis and systematically and consistently expands them. Three members of the Audit Committee have particular knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles and internal control processes financial experts. Professor Susanne Hannemann Louise Öfverström and Ulrich Grillo are independent and are not former members of the Executive Board of the company. The Personnel and Remuneration Committee met three times in February September and November and prepared topics for the Supervisory Board plenary assembly including the content and structure of the target agreements the extent to which targets were achieved for fiscal and the setting of the targets ranges and calculation basis for Executive Board variable remuneration in . Other topics were the text of the remuneration report for and the remuneration of the Supervisory Board. In addition the revision of the Executive Board remuneration system was presented and the adjustments for were resolved. In this context an adjustment to the weighting of EBT and OFCF as part of the STI was discussed in detail and subsequently decided upon. The reason given for the decision was that future growth potential requires investments that have not always been taken into account in the planning and may be unscheduled. These are therefore more difficult to manage within one year and are unsuitable for the STI. In the past fiscal year the Nomination Committee met in August and December to prepare nominations for Supervisory Board mandates expiring at the Annual General Meeting. At the meeting in August the committee discussed the professional requirements for the qualification of Supervisory Board members and the extent to which the skills profile might need to be adjusted due to the ongoing efficiency review of the Supervisory Board and the development of the Rheinmetall Group. In light of the upcoming election of two new Supervisory Board members at the Annual General Meeting interviews were conducted with candidates taking into account the requirements of the law the German Corporate Governance Code and the targets resolved by the Supervisory Board for its composition and skills profile. When searching for candidates the results of the efficiency review and the recommendations on composition were also taken into account including in particular the aspects of geopolitics and further strengthening of ESG expertise. Taking these requirements into account the committee then made recommendations to the plenary assembly of the Supervisory Board at the meeting in December regarding proposals for the election of new shareholder representatives to the Supervisory Board. These election proposals will be published with the invitation to the Annual General Meeting. In spring it is intended to update the skills profile of the Supervisory Board taking these election proposals into account. The committee pursuant to section of the German Codetermination Act which is required under statutory law did not convene in the past fiscal year.,,0.32887489417633586,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We followed the recommendations contained in the latest version of the code dated April with one exception exclusion of subsequent changes to target values or comparison parameters in .

The complete wording of the current and previous declarations of conformity with the code can be viewed on the companys website under the heading Corporate Governance Declaration of Conformity. No indications of any actual conflicts of interest involving members of the Executive Board or Supervisory Board within the meaning of principle and Recommendations E. and E. of the GCGC were identified in the past fiscal year. No former members of the Executive Board of the company are members of the Supervisory Board. The members of the Supervisory Board take their own initiative to undertake any training that may be required. Where required they are supported in their efforts by the company. The Supervisory Board regularly carries out an assessment of its activities evaluating aspects such as Supervisory Board process flows the allocation of responsibilities the flow of information between the Supervisory Board and its committees the routing of information from the Executive Board and the interaction of the two boards. The results of past efficiency reviews which were performed either as selfassessments or with external input were consistently positive. The workflows and processes of the Supervisory Board were classed as targetoriented and efficient and any knowledge obtained is incorporated into the Supervisory Boards work. After the Supervisory Board targets were updated and a skills profile for the entire Supervisory Board was adopted at the meeting in August an efficiency review was carried out in fiscal . The skills profile for the full Supervisory Board is to be updated in spring taking into account the nomination proposals for two new members of the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board.

96,Letter to shareholders Combined management report Consolidated financial statement Further information Basic information on the Rheinmetall Group Structure of the Rheinmetall Group RHEINMETALL ANNUAL REPORT ,,0.328528458505282,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
98,The Rheinmetall Group comprises Rheinmetall Aktiengesellschaft a listed stock corporation established under the laws of Germany and entered in the commercial register of the District Court of Düsseldorf under the number HRB and its subsidiaries. The Articles of Association of the company were last amended on May . Rheinmetall AG is the parent company of the Rheinmetall Group and has its registered office in Düsseldorf Germany at the Group headquarters.

Rheinmetall AG ensures that there is a Groupwide standardized planning control and management process in place and within the context of the compliance management system it monitors the Groupwide implementation of laws guidelines and regulations in accordance with a set of uniform criteria. With effect from October the Vehicle Systems Division was reorganised at management level. It was divided into the Vehicle Systems Europe and Vehicle Systems International divisions. Vehicle Systems Europe primarily focuses on the European market not including Great Britain while Vehicles Systems International concentrates on the markets of Australia the US and Great Britain. This will allow the group to better address the specific challenges and opportunities of the respective markets. Both divisions already have their own management team and are directly managed by the Executive Board. Corporate management and control In external reporting the two divisions are presented as one segment Vehicle Systems. To ensure that the structure of the Group better reflects the technologies products and business areas it covers individual companies were also allocated to different divisions or to the Group service companies and other nonoperating companies in line with their business activity with effect from October . This had a particular impact on Weapon and Ammunition and Electronic Solutions. The smallbore business area is managed as a noncore business outside the structure of the group. In December Rheinmetall and Comitans Capital AG signed a sale and purchase agreement for the entire smallbore business area. They are aiming to close the transaction which is still subject to approval by the relevant authorities as of March . The transfer of technology between the individual parts of the Group and a focus on futuredriven technologies and business areas with large potential for sustained growth and value enhancement are the cornerstones of the structure. ,,,,,,,0.4054169569372126,,,,,,,,,,,,
102,A market and customeroriented approach and the establishment of lasting relationships with customers form the basis of Rheinmetalls business activities. The activities are consistently aligned towards the economic regions of Europe America Asia and Australia. In the year under review Rheinmetall was represented at locations worldwide. Information on the sales distribution by region can be found under Sales by region while the distribution of employees is described under Employees.Rheinmetall AG has direct or indirect holdings in companies in Germany and abroad previous year that are part of the Rheinmetall Group. The scope of consolidation includes subsidiaries previous year . In financial a total of nine companies were added to the fully consolidated subsidiaries through formation and three companies through acquisition. The disposals of the fully consolidated subsidiaries from the scope of consolidation are attributable to three sales. Expal Systems S.A.U. was added to the Group as a fully consolidated subsidiary. With the acquisition of Expal Systems S.A.U. Rheinmetall is opening up further production capacities in the field of large and medium calibre ammunition and expanding its product portfolio. Thanks to the technologies available at Expal and the order backlog the acquisition also helps to secure Rheinmetalls core business in the field of weapons ammunition and propulsion systems in the long term. In the Pistons division which is managed as a noncore business the largebore pistons business was sold and several blocks of shares held in Shriram Pistons Rings Ltd. were sold. A total of companies are carried at equity as compared to companies in the previous year. The Group is also involved in joint operations previous year . ,,,0.38436266104531475,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

127,Legal regulations on exports of military equipment The Federal Republic of Germany has one of the strictest export control systems in the world. German military equipment exports are governed by the Grundgesetz GG German Basic Law the Gesetz über die Kontrolle von Kriegswaffen KrWaffKontrG German War Weapons Control Act and the Außenwirtschaftsgesetz AWG Foreign German Trade and Payments Act in conjunction with the Außenwirtschaftsverordnung AWV German Foreign Trade and Payments Regulation. The Political Principles Adopted by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany for the Export of War Weapons and Other Military Equipment of June provide the licensing authorities with guidelines. European and German exports of military equipment are being restricted by numerous bans licensing and reporting requirements at EU and national level. These restrictions allow the authorities to check critical exports and other foreign trade dealings with respect to arms control objectives. EU law takes precedence over national law including German law. Nonetheless according to Article TFEU Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union all member states can take measures they consider necessary for the protection of their essential national security interests. Decisions on the production of or trade in arms munitions and war materials are therefore up to the respective national lawmakers. War weapons Article of German Basic Law states that the manufacture transportation and marketing of war weapons requires a license from the German government. The details are specified in a federal law the German War Weapons Control Act KrWaffKontrG. An annex to the KrWaffKontrG the War Weapons List lists all items that are definitively regarded as war weapons. War weapons include not only devices such as battle tanks armored combat support vehicles and machine guns but also certain types of ammunition such as tank or artillery ammunition. As well as complete devices and ammunition systems certain assemblies and components such as the turret and chassis of a battle tank or the projectile warhead or fuse for certain types of ammunition are additionally defined as war weapons. The KrWaffKontrG includes an extensive licensing system for war weapons. Almost every activity relating to these goods requires a license. A license is required for the production of war weapons both during development and in series production. Transfer of the actual control over war weapons also requires a license as does the purchasing of these weapons. The transportation of war weapons within a country is also subject to licensing. Moreover the transportation of war weapons using German ships or aircraft outside German territory requires a license. Trading and brokerage transactions involving war weapons that are not intended to affect German territory are also subject to licensing. Above all the importing exporting and transit of war weapons requires a license. Exporting a war weapon requires not only the applicable licenses in accordance with the KrWaffKontrG but also an additional license for export purposes specifically an export license in accordance with the Foreign Trade and Payments Act AWG or the Foreign Trade and Payments Regulation AWV. ,,,0.47362372914933315,,,,0.45692561975258655,,,0.33098698855297215,,,,,0.30932581766274975,,,,
129,Regulations on other military equipment Other types of military equipment are listed in Part I Section A of the Export List an annex to the German Foreign Trade and Payments Regulation. In particular the export of these goods requires a license. The term goods and therefore the export controls apply not just to goods but to technology and software as well. Licenses are also needed for some types of technical support i.e. the transfer of intangible knowledge and capabilities and for some trading and brokerage transactions. It is generally possible to import other types of military equipment without a license. National regulations on trade and exports of military equipment The Federal Republic of Germany is entitled to restrict the foreign trade and in particular the export of military equipment including war weapons by imposing licensing requirements or bans for example to safeguard the material security interests of the Federal Republic of Germany to prevent a disturbance to the peaceful coexistence of nations or a major disruption to the foreign relations of the Federal Republic of Germany to safeguard the public order or security of the Federal Republic of Germany or another member state of the European Union or in the interests of the European Union and in addition to implement the decisions of the European Council on economic sanctions within the sphere of Common Foreign and Security Policy to carry out the obligations of the member states of the European Union that are stipulated in directly applicable binding acts of the European Union on the imposition of economic sanctions in the sphere of Common Foreign and Security Policy and to implement resolutions of the United Nations Security Council or intergovernmental agreements. Regulations on trade of military equipment at EU level The adoption of the Council Common Position CFSP defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment of December created a legally binding regime for all EU member states. The Council Common Position of December sets out a total of eight criteria for assessing export license applications. It gives mention to an EU Common Military List which largely matches the corresponding lists of controlled military equipment of the EU member states. Controlled goods that come under these lists are largely defined and amended by the international export control regime. The Wassenaar Arrangement WA in particular governs the export controls of conventional military equipment and dualuse goods and related technology. The Australia Group AG is active in the area of chemical and biological agents and dualuse goods and technologies. Furthermore the aim of preventing proliferation is pursued by the Missile Technology Control Regime MTCR in the area of ballistic missiles and by the Nuclear Suppliers Group NSG in the area of nuclear weapons. The goods in the respective item lists in the Annex to the EU DualUse Regulation and German export lists are reflected in German law. International regulations on trade of military equipment There has been a set of internationally applicable standards for the trade of conventional military equipment since the Arms Trade Treaty ATT came into force in December . On April the United Nations General Assembly approved a resolution by a large majority to adopt the text of the Arms Trade Treaty. The treaty came into force on December . A total of countries have signed the treaty to date including Germany. Decision of the German government on exports of military equipment The German government makes decisions on exports of military equipment based on its Political Principles for the Export of War Weapons and Other Military Equipment. These political principles take into account the German War Weapons Control Act and the Foreign Trade and Payments Act in conjunction with the European Council Common Position of December defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment the Arms Trade Treaty that came into force on December and any respective subsequent regulations. The criteria laid down in the Common Position and any subsequent regulations form an integral part of these political principles. The principles on the export of military equipment from June expressly prohibit the export of small arms and light weapons to third countries. Licenses for these weapons and the associated ammunition are now issued by the federal government only in exceptional cases. If the political principles set out more restrictive measures than the Common Position they take precedence. Licenses for the export of war weapons and other military equipment are granted only on the basis of reliable prior knowledge of end use by the intended enduser. This generally requires appropriate written assurance by the enduser in the official enduser certificate. The granting of licenses can additionally be made contingent upon the recipient country giving its consent to onsite postshipment controls in line with the federal governments adopted key points for the introduction of postshipment controls for German military equipment exports and any subsequent regulations. ,,,0.43881958628734613,,,,0.41416695447208457,,,0.34930285475741923,,,,,0.3380088140197037,,,,
130,Shipments of war weapons and other military goods of a quantity or type that could be relevant to war weapons are approved only upon presentation of official enduser certificates that include a reexport ban subject to authority approval. This applies mutatis mutandis to any other military equipment related to war weapons exported in connection with a manufacturing license. Effective end use regulations must be made a precondition for these manufactured war weapons. War weapons and other military equipment related to war weapons may be reexported to third countries or brought into the EU single market only if the federal government has consented to this in writing. A recipient country that flouts an issued enduser certificate to approve the reexport of war weapons or other military equipment related to war weapons or that has knowingly failed to prevent or has not sanctioned an unapproved export of such weapons or equipment will be generally excluded from receiving any further deliveries of war weapons or other military equipment related to war weapons until the situation is resolved. The same applies if postshipment controls identify violations of the enduser certificate or a country refuses to conduct onsite controls despite making a commitment to this effect in its enduser certificate. Other goods Other goods besides war weapons and other military equipment are controlled namely dualuse goods i.e. goods that can be used for civilian and military purposes. In other words they are not purely civilian goods. Purely civilian goods are not generally subject to any export restrictions. With a few exceptions they can be exported without requiring a license. Export of dualuse goods The export of dualuse goods has been harmonized at European Union level since . The European Parliament and Council Regulation EU of May setting up a regime for the control of exports brokering technical assistance transit and transfer of dualuse items EU DualUse Regulation applies here. A common list of items lists all dualuse items that are subject to uniform control regulations in all EU countries. These are based on the aforementioned international export control regime. The transfer of these goods within the EU is free apart from a few exceptions. In addition to the EU DualUse Regulation there are further listed dualuse goods in Part I Section B of the Export List to the Foreign Trade and Payments Regulation AWV that also require a license to be exported. These are nationally listed dualuse goods. Export of nonlisted goods To ensure seamless export controls there are also licensing requirements for goods that are not technically described in any of the aforementioned export lists and are known as nonlisted goods. These licensing requirements involve openended lists that prevent lowtech goods from being used for armaments projects. These are referred to as catchall clauses. Factors that play a role in licensing approval include the intended purpose of the goods and the respective purchasing country or country of destination. A licensing requirement may exist if the goods are intended to be used or may be used in connection with the development manufacture handling operation maintenance storage tracking identification or dissemination of chemical biological or nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosives or for the development manufacture maintenance or storage of missiles for such weapons or are intended to be used for a military end purpose in an arms embargo country or for use as components of military goods exported without requiring a license or where the goods are for digital surveillance the goods are or may be intended in whole or in part for use in connection with internal repression andor the commission of serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. Vehicle emissions Mobility in its current dominant form relies on burning fossil fuels which is inextricably linked to the emission of substances that are harmful to health and the environment. In metropolitan areas in particular traffic is repeatedly leading to severe impairment of air quality. To reduce the negative impact on citizens health from trafficrelated exhaust gases and cut greenhouse gas emissions legislators in many countries are issuing limits for passenger cars and for light and heavyduty commercial vehicles.

149,Hungary and Corporate Compliance Officer for Southern Europe with a focus on Spain were also established to support the increasingly important locations and major projects in other European countries. The Chief Compliance Officer reports to the Executive Board and the Supervisory Boards Audit Committee on a regular basis by attending meetings on the status and effectiveness of the compliance management system and on the latest developments. In serious cases the committees are informed immediately. In addition the heads of the divisions are also kept apprised monthly by the Division Compliance Officers of current developments new rules planned training measures and possible compliance infringements as well as the status of possible investigations. Compliance is taken into account as an aspect of risk in decisionmaking processes not only when it comes to considerations regarding the strategic and operational alignment of the Rheinmetall Group but also in daytoday business. The central compliance management system with its integrated and dynamic focus on constantly updated key risk aspects such as corruption data protection violations or attempted fraud is firmly anchored in the Groupwide management and control structures and includes all instruments processes and extensive measures intended to ensure that procedures in the companies of the Rheinmetall Group comply with the applicable countryspecific legislation general legal conditions regulatory provisions and the companys own regulations. It also creates an organizational structure that allows the applicable standards to be publicized across the divisions and their implementation status to be tracked. If binding legal regulations in individual countries deviate from the rules set out in the compliance management system the stricter regulation shall apply where permissible. In the case of changes to the content the Chief Compliance Officers approval is also required. The compliance management system is updated at regular intervals not only in line with the applicable legal requirements but also in the light of new findings from reporting comparisons with other compliance systems and the assessment of external specialists benchmarking. It is also reviewed on an adhoc basis if any breach of compliance regulations is suspected or discovered. Implementation of the compliance management system is monitored by regular reports to Corporate Compliance and by routine and special audits conducted by internal auditing and the compliance organization. Compliance officers also monitor important transactions in the companies such as mergers and acquisitions the establishment of joint ventures preemployment checks and the integration of sales brokers thereby supporting the respective departments in their work. In addition compliance officers advise the people responsible in the operational units on how to take compliance into account in operational business processes. In the area of sales support there is a platform containing compliancerelevant information on around countries and regions. Moreover the tender process in the security and defence technology area is structured to the effect that in the course of the bidno bid decision a compliance audit using defined criteria is obligatory for projects over a certain value threshold. Various IT tools are also used across the group to support compliance processes. Corporate Compliance Compliance Program Prevention A compliance risk prevention guideline has been implemented with the aim of ensuring a standardized procedure for systematic risk prevention and creating the structural and organizational preconditions required for this at all levels in the company. Procedures for taking an initial inventory of compliance risks identifying response measures and planning regular repeat measures are defined for different applications. To help continuously identify compliance risks and to develop and improve mitigation measures the Prevention team was established which focuses on structural prevention topics on an ongoing or project basis. In addition to the webbased training courses available in the Empower Learn HR system for the companies in Germany Austria and Switzerland DACH relating to the categories of Code of Conduct anticorruption and data protection Prevention uses the TRACE learning management system for companies outside the DACH region offering around training modules in various languages. The rollout of the regulatory compliance project launched in which is intended to expand the litigationproof organization was driven forward in the fiscal year. Next an IT tool will be introduced to enable the employees concerned in over countries those who have increased contact with regulatory areas subject to liability in their everyday and project business to deal with the complex regulations more easily and reliably. ,,,,,,,,,,0.3411140253907125,,,,,0.3365346857275972,,,,
150,The goal of making the processes projects and tasks enshrined in the compliance management system more measurable and transparent is achieved with a reporting tool. More than employees entrusted with a compliance function in around units of the company make use of the many opportunities to track assess and manage the status of a large number of compliancerelevant processes and projects at various organizational levels of the Rheinmetall Group. These include reporting on the status quo of training courses audits risk analyses consulting focal points processes compliance levels for guideline rollouts and the recording of project statuses. The associated evaluation options will now enable compliance reporting to the Executive Board and Supervisory Board to focus on identified compliance risk areas and the mitigation measures established as well as the related KPIs. Corporate Compliance Compliance Program Regulation Taking account of or on the basis of external conditions such as laws regulations etc. and internal organizational requirements the Executive Board of Rheinmetall AG issues regulations for the Rheinmetall Group so that all employees concerned act in line with standardized processes. Regulation Management which is based in the central Corporate Compliance department provides support with the preparation and management of conduct and processrelated regulations of Rheinmetall AG for the Rheinmetall Group. To ensure a standardized procedure the Regulation Management Manual is available. This manual is aimed primarily at publishers and authors as well as members of the Executive Board and management bodies but also includes several interfaces at all organizational levels. In the Central Regulations Register on the Groups intranet all regulations approved by the Executive Board can be called up at any time. These are provided in German and English in line with the corporate languages. Using a continuously updated summary all employees can obtain a quick overview of the professionally regulated topics. Corporate Compliance Compliance Program Business Partners As a shared service center the central Compliance Due Diligence center of expertise conducts not only preemployment checks on applicants for key positions but also all compliance due diligence checks on new and existing business partners e.g. procurement cooperation and sales partners on a Groupwide basis. The focus lies here on determining whether the commitment is legally permissible whether all attributable people can be identified know your customer KYC and know your supplier KYS and whether conflicts of interest are excluded. The general performance and integrity of the business partner are also assessed. The local compliance organization will continue concentrating on assessing the transactionspecific compliance risk associated with the commitment of a business partner at company level. The center of expertise will be integrated into daytoday operational business through various technical and procedural interfaces. There is already a relatively high degree of digitalization in the Compliance Due Diligence organization. In addition to a specific management database for selecting managing and monitoring cooperation and sales partners the whole integrity due diligence process can now be performed via a secure online platform as well. As part of special projects large quantities of data from business partners were migrated to the electronic thirdparty management system again in the year under review. In the past fiscal year apart from the business partners screened by the automated procedure around business partners and people who applied for key positions at the Rheinmetall Group were subjected to nonautomated screening in procedures of varying complexity depending on the risk. An additional existing partners were automatically transferred to monitoring and processed by way of bulk uploads. Corporate Compliance Central Investigation If employees have information on questionable activities that have been observed specific breaches of regulations or business practices that may be prohibited they can contact not only their line manager but also and in full confidence various internal offices as well as an independent external ombudsperson lawyer and so avert losses for the company. Incident management is also supported by the electronic whistleblower platform Integrity Line which has been implemented throughout the Group. In addition employees can contact the compliance organization directly if they suspect or know of breaches of regulations or business practices. In addition to employees external parties can also contact the ombudsperson by telephone or email send an email to speakuprheinmetall.com or contact a specialist compliance officer by telephone. ,,0.36514721149042006,0.41284052953972444,,0.390419065849129,0.3612710522925015,0.4021079744670628,,,0.35575223759324753,,,0.3489736417631496,,0.38295952707661024,0.2867390244422629,0.2276502404970645,,
153,The Executive Board is responsible for setting up a Groupwide data protection management system DPMS. Within the compliance organization the structures required for the Groupwide implementation of legal data protection requirements were established and an effective DPMS was introduced. The Group Data Privacy Officer manages the data privacy officers at the company divisions liaises with them to manage the implementation of the DPMS and further develops the DPMS where required. He reports regularly to the Chief Compliance Officer and where required to the Executive Board and Supervisory Board directly. Data protection management relates to the organizational setup and processes required to safeguard the implementation of legal requirements involved in the planning organization management and shutdown of automated or dataprotectioncompliant personal data processing operations. The Rheinmetall Group companies that process personal data or arrange to have it processed are responsible for ensuring that the procedures in place for processing this personal data function reliably and appropriately. To ensure effective implementation of data protection requirements the DPMS sets out the possibilities and limitations for allocation and responsibilities for processes and requirements. The companies of the Rheinmetall Group take a variety of steps to ensure the protection of personal data. The DPMS contains standards for dataprotectionrelated processes. In the Rheinmetall Group the implementation of data protection requirements for the global handling of personal data is regulated by the data protection rules and specified further by the data protection manual on the DPMS for the EUEEA jurisdiction. By means of the DPMS Rheinmetall establishes an appropriate level of data protection worldwide for processing personal data. Control processes and documentation requirements for the findings of dataprotectionrelated processes and controls are also being implemented. ,,,,,,,,,,0.35554764571269315,,,0.3517612174320086,,0.32782548861568545,,,,

156,To make employees at all levels of the company aware of compliance risks numerous introduction events training seminars and workshops are held some of which are tailored to specific functions such as management buyers or sales staff. Legislation and important regulations are explained and further content is provided at these sessions. Attention is also drawn to internal compliance requirements risks and possible sanctions and based on case studies practical advice is given on appropriate conduct in specific situations during everyday work. These classroom training sessions which also serve as a practical forum for discussions are accompanied by interactive online programs. Each year as part of compliance awareness training employees at sites in Germany and abroad not only receive training in general compliance topics but also in the prevention of corruption conflicts of interest money laundering and CEO BEC fraud as well as in export control and antitrust and competition law. The compliance training matrix which forms part of the procedural instructions for compliance training provides an overview of the training content geared toward the different target groups and management levels. Its content is adjusted in accordance with the needs of the participants or supplemented with countryspecific or regional peculiarities. In the past fiscal year some participants attended classroom training sessions on various compliance topics. In addition around compliancerelevant elearning modules were completed in the year under review. Our employees also receive regular instruction and training in matters relating to data protection. The content of data protection training is adapted for individual departments in line with the specific requirements in their spheres of work. The relevant departments here were selected on the basis of data protection and compliance risks. For new employees general data protection training is part of the onboarding process. A new elearning module was also introduced in the past fiscal year and is available in numerous languages. In addition all levels of the company are provided with data protection advice on an ad hoc basis. ,,,,,,,,,,0.3447548018406933,,,0.3523084109707822,,0.3331617851354384,0.29690944113268936,,,
158,As derived from the strategic objectives in the Rheinmetall Group the divisions are managed and the economic success of the operational entities is assessed using the three most important financial indicators i.e. three core performance indicators as defined by the German Accounting Standard No. . ,,0.3378899298056906,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
165,Other relevant financial indicators include earnings before interest and taxes EBIT earnings before taxes EBT and return on capital employed ROCE. The return on capital employed means the ratio of EBIT to average capital employed average of values as of the balance sheet dates January and December of the year under review. Capital employed on a reporting date is the sum of fixed assets working capital and other assets and other liabilities. Furthermore the level of capital expenditure and the research and development expenses are relevant financial indicators for the Rheinmetall Group. Nonfinancial indicators for the Rheinmetall Group include the headcount by fulltime equivalent FTE the accident frequency rate LTIR and in addition to energy efficiency energy intensity and CO,,0.3818926264834207,0.41470356619304993,,0.3589198398026604,0.3394880115365796,,,,,,,,,,,,,
168,At the beginning of fiscal year the existing key order figures were further developed with the aim of establishing a crosssegment indicator for Groupwide sales activity and the future sales potential of the Rheinmetall Group. As a new order indicator Rheinmetall Backlog comprises the previously used order backlog key figure as well as the new frame backlog and nominated backlog key figures. The frame backlog reflects the expected future calloffs from existing framework agreements for the security business which are converted into order backlog when called off by the customer. Based on existing written agreements and framework contracts with customers the nominated backlog figure shows the future calloffs expected for the civil business from these customer agreements. The sales resulting from the frame backlog and the nominated backlog may differ from the corresponding amounts depending on the final calloff quantities. The new Rheinmetall Nomination indicator is composed of the previously used order intake and booked business indicators as well as the new flow indicator for the security business the frame nomination. Similarly to the booked business indicator used for the civil business this represents the expected value of new framework agreements concluded with customers. Like booked business frame nomination does not yet represent binding customer orders so actual calloff volumes and the resulting sales may vary. The frame backlog is converted into order backlog by way of the calloffs reported as order intake. Within Rheinmetall Nomination this change is presented as frame utilization. ,,,,,,0.3446662095708216,0.4869276011815102,0.3804922842248183,,,,,,0.4211831487781785,,,,,
178,Acceleration of technology penetration In addition to market growth the war of aggression has also resulted in an acceleration of technology penetration. Thus as well as the need for conventional landbased weapon systems demand in the areas of autonomy digitalization electrification networked reconnaissance and communications is also rising sharply. Digitalization The growth of digitalization is continuing apace in both a civilian and security context. The connectedness of people and systems is becoming increasingly important for armed forces as a means of enhancing security and protecting the lives of soldiers. The German armed forces describes digitalization as the key to information command and combat superiority as well as enforcement and response capability in the battlefield of the future. In NATO announced its vision for the digital transformation By the Alliance is to be in a position to ensure interoperability in all environments improve situational awareness and facilitate databased decisionmaking. The demand for solutions designed to protect support and connect the armed forces of tomorrow has never been greater than it is now.Acceleration of the energy transition As an indirect consequence of the war the planned energy transition has also been accelerated in order to reduce dependence on Russia in the energy sector. In this context the Green Deals industrial policy instrument aimed at reducing net greenhouse gas emissions was expanded to include the REPowerEU program adopted in May . This includes both a tightening of targets and expanded measures and subsidies for the expansion of the hydrogen economy.Transformation of the automotive industry As part of the energy transition the shift in the vehicle drive mix toward electromobility has also advanced. For example a mix of around electric vehicles is currently assumed worldwide by .Destabilization of value chains The coronavirus pandemic and Ukraine war put the global supply chains under severe pressure in especially. Inflation rates were high. While inflation for producer prices actually slipped into minus in Q compared with the same period of the previous year certain components are still exposed to risks in the supply chain. New world order The geopolitical shifts have led to an increased polarization of the world order. As things stand it can be assumed that this trend will continue and entail significant geopolitical uncertainty. Not least the outcome of the presidential election in the USA will play a key role here. In combination with the abovementioned drivers it may well be that the structure of procurement and sales markets will also be reorganized as a result.Sustainability Sustainability has become a guiding principle for countries and economic areas alike and thus an important driving force for society business and politics. The year was of crucial importance. In September of that year the Agenda with its goals and subgoals for sustainable development was adopted by the global community. Behind it is a global plan for peace and prosperity for people and for protecting our planet now and in the future. Dealing with the consequences of climate change also requires international cooperation and coordinated solutions. In December world leaders passed an important hurdle with the Paris Climate Agreement at the UN Climate Change Conference. It marked the beginning of a shift toward a world with net zero emissions. National European and international legal requirements to mitigate the consequences of climate change sustainable finance and human rights due diligence as well as sustainability scores from customers and suppliers and major ESG rating agencies have since accelerated the impact of sustainability on business. ,,,,0.33285592425052285,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

229,In the Bearings business unit development activity in the area of ICE applications was ramped down significantly in compared with the previous years while development in the strategic market segments of nonmotor automotive and industrial applications increased. The product portfolio was successfully expanded to include further environmentally friendly leadfree plain bearing solutions which are used in a range of interior exterior and chassis applications in the automotive sector as well as in industrial applications such as hydraulic pumps and compressors. Further progress was also made in the development of plain bearings for wind turbines and innovative components for hydrogen production both of which are strategic projects in the context of the energy transition. In the Castings business unit worked on expanding its strategic project portfolio in the automotive truck emobility new mobility and engineering service application areas. The primary focus here is on the application of expertise in the area of highly complex components. In addition industrialization in the area of emobility new mobility is being driven forward. In the area of automotive and motor applications the focus remained on the series production of a complex cylinder crankcase CCC by means of lowpressure sand casting and on the expansion of process development for the series production of electric motor housings for electric drives. These developments are aimed at both the European and Asian markets and will lead to an expanded product and market portfolio. In addition product developments for battery applications were also driven forward in the field of emobility. The successful series production run of a new product support frame for a European original equipment manufacturer deserves special mention. Another focus of was the industrialization of various lightweight construction applications outside the powertrain scope. In addition to the further development of existing structural and chassis components work was also performed on new products for large integrated complex lightweight components. In Rheinmetall Invent GmbH continued the projects launched over previous years to open up new business areas and markets for Materials and Trade in the future markets of energy and mobility. With regard to energy recovery systems series production began on the first customer projects and some additional new customer application developments were acquired. In addition initial prototypes for two areas of application cabin airconditioning and heat pumps were produced and tested. The newly implemented business unit for hydrogen storage systems was launched in as part of a publicly funded project and is currently in the development and testing phase. The targeted system benefits have been very well received by customers. Regarding glassfiberreinforced springs a number of customers have expressed their interest in this novel technology. Together with them the fundamental qualification for future series projects was continued. ,,0.3557710882846075,0.47368415405409314,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

262,The risk of a gas shortage in Europe was averted due to various factors. The mild temperatures in the winter half of the year and the low level of industrial activity reduced demand while supply was expanded particularly with LNG. In addition government measures helped alleviate uncertainty among market participants. The yearahead price consequently fell by over the course of the year. Although prices have decreased significantly again a return to levels below per MWh for Europe remains unrealistic. Expiring government assistance growing demand and disruptions to LNG deliveries still represent risk factors. There are also continued dependencies on Russia resulting in an ongoing risk of deliveries being suspended due to intervention by Russia or the EU. Electricity prices fell in step with gas. The increasing generation of renewable energy also helped reduce power generation prices. More innovative largescale storage solutions combined with the expansion of renewable energy still have the potential to uncouple electricity and gas prices from one another. In addition the EU is still conducting negotiations with regard to reforming the design of the electricity markets which is intended to stabilize these markets in the long term. ,,,,0.3534281754648462,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

440,Sales Sales of Sensors and Actuators rose slightly by . or million to million in the reporting year. Adjusted for currency effects the increase in sales was million and thus lower than global growth in light vehicle production which is estimated at IHS Markit. This difference is attributable to the fact that IHS only partly reflects the relevant market for Sensors and Actuators and does not consider the truck market or industrial applications for example. The Air Management product area of Sensors and Actuators increased its sales significantly by compared to the previous year. This was chiefly due to sales of electric gas pumps on the Chinese and North American market as well as sales of exhaust gas recirculation systems and exhaust flaps for both the light and the heavyduty segment. The Thermal Management business unit recorded a decline in sales due to lower sales volumes of variable oil pumps and electric vacuum pumps. In the Electrification Digitalization area sales increased particularly due to the oil and water valves allocated here whereas a decline was recorded for the electrical switching valve and electropneumatic transducer product groups. In regional terms the development of sales varied considerably between the different sales markets. While the North American market and the Asian market closed fiscal down slightly on the previous years level an increase was achieved in Europe . Booked business Booked business of Sensors and Actuators in fiscal came to million lower than a year earlier previous year million. In fiscal previous year of this was attributable to the Internal Combustion Engine ICE category previous year to Industrial Technology previous year to Truck and previous year to Electrification. In this context orders for highvoltage water pumps in electric vehicles were also acquired in . Several orders were acquired for fuel cell applications in the passenger car sector and for water pumps in the industrial technology sector. Nominated backlog The nominated backlog in the Sensors and Actuators division in fiscal came to million higher than a year earlier previous year million. Operating result Sensors and Actuators achieved an operating result of million in fiscal . This puts the operating result million down on the previous year. The operating margin declined by . percentage points in to .. High inflation caused by increased commodities and energy prices resulted in significant procurement price hikes for materials. These cost increases were offset by higher sales prices at customers. The sharp increases in staff costs due to inflation had a lasting negative impact on earnings. As in the previous year depreciation and amortization was reduced further. Business recovery costs were also incurred following the attack on IT systems in April . Operating free cash flow Operating free cash flow of Sensors and Actuators was down yearonyear at million previous year million. This decrease in cash flow was mainly due to lower earnings and higher capital expenditure. In addition working capital was higher than in the previous year. Inventories were up yearonyear due to higher procurement prices and increased inventory levels to safeguard production against supplier insolvencies and to ensure longterm delivery capacity. ,,,,0.3769053673808752,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

478,dimensions are considered in the evaluation of the extent of loss and different risk impacts are determined the dimension that was evaluated more highly shall apply. Measures aimed at controlling the risks that were identified and evaluated over a threeyear period must be formulated and their implementation systematically monitored. On this basis formal reporting takes place to the Executive Board and the heads of the divisions including in their capacities as heads of the relevant legal entities. This risk reporting is based on bundled information on risk types risk fields and the corresponding countermeasures and in contrast to ad hoc and operational risk management not explicitly on individual risks. Reporting from the various entities is concluded with the review of the risk portfolio by the risk managers and the subsequent release by the relevant CFO. Suitable preventive validation and corrective actions lower the probability of risks occurring or limit the extent of loss. The risk management measures introduced are monitored on an ongoing basis and where necessary adjusted in line with a new risk assessment. The Governance Risk and Compliance Committee set up by Rheinmetall AGs Executive Board and comprising the heads of Controlling and Risk Management Legal Compliance Accounting and Internal Auditing serves as an interface between those functions within the company that are particularly committed to protecting the Rheinmetall Group against risks. In particular it combines the subfunctions of corporate governance the internal control system ICS the risk management system RMS the compliance management system CMS and internal auditing. The Committee meets at least once a quarter discusses and reviews the current risk portfolio and the status of risk management measures. This ensures that the Executive Board and the managers of the Rheinmetall Group are regularly kept up to date by the central Controlling and Risk Management department about the development of the overall risk situation the status of and significant changes to important ventures that must be reported as well as the status of countermeasures that have already been introduced. If necessary additional measures are taken in order to further limit and reduce identified potential risks. Sudden or unexpected risks with significant consequences are reported to the Executive Board on an ad hoc basis. The Supervisory Board is advised of individual operational risks in the quarterly reports that entail a net loss exceeding million of EBIT and also have a probability of occurrence of or more. The thresholds for reporting risks to the Supervisory Board on an ad hoc basis are a net loss of more than million of EBIT and a probability of occurrence of more than . By contrast risks with a potential loss below million andor that have a probability of occurrence of less than are not reported. In order to calculate the riskbearing capacity in accordance with IDW PS .as amended a Monte Carlo simulation was performed in to determine the overall risk situation of the Rheinmetall Group. IDW PS as amended defines riskbearing capacity as the maximum risk that the Rheinmetall Group can bear over time without seriously jeopardizing its existence. This requires both the determination and measurement of an overall risk position and the comparison of overall risk with the business resources available to cover the risk at Rheinmetall with regard to net assets financial position and results of operations which can be used to mitigate the effects of the risk. To ensure that we identify at an early stage risks that combined could potentially jeopardize the continued existence of the Rheinmetall Group the potential aggregate impact of our main risks was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation based on the aggregated results from the annual strategic risk management assessment process. We compare the resulting aggregated risk situation with the thresholds defined by the Executive Board for critical key figures. ,,0.324450211200855,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parallel to this transformation for drives it is particularly digitalization in vehicles which offers an opportunity to bring new products and product functionalities to the market. On the other hand this trend also harbors the risk that moving into digital technology and product segments requires high expenditure in establishing expertise for development and production. Furthermore it should also be taken into account that products with a high share of digitalization generally have shorter product life cycles which ultimately can result in high expenditure for adjustments and thus amortization risks. Misjudgments regarding future market developments or the development of products systems or services that are not taken up by the market as expected as well as missed development deadlines fundamental changes in customer demand that were not foreseen or responded to adequately increased startup costs for new products or delays in launching innovations on the market can lead to a deterioration in our competitive and economic situation. However intensive market and competitor monitoring and analyses the market presence and customer proximity associated with international distribution structures as well as regular discussions with customers and suppliers make it possible for us to identify trends on the sales markets in good time and to align product strategies consistently towards new requirements. Feasibility studies profitability analyses modern project management aimed at reviewing the criteria for technical and economic success bringing the sales and development units closer together the involvement of customers in the definition design development and testing of new products and safeguarding our technological position through property rights especially patents reduces possible RDspecific risks such as misdevelopments and budget overruns. Thanks to a balanced mix of short medium and longterm projects in a wellfilled research and development pipeline we are making advances in new markets and technological fields and in doing so further safeguarding our technology positions. Further information on research and development activities can be found under Basic information on the Rheinmetall Group research and development. Rheinmetalls focus on developing new technologies and innovations outside the existing core business and bringing them to market maturity quickly is particularly on the technology segments of automation new sensor technology artificial intelligence AI and new mobility. The latter is particularly supported by targeted activities in the area of electromobility and hydrogen technologies. Further details are presented in the Research and development chapter. Despite compliance with the processes and the use of stateoftheart project management monitoring and controlling measures developing new products and launching new technologies and products entail risks in addition to changes to existing product portfolios. These exist not only in the actual design and development phase but also during market launch where startup costs may be higher than expected or unscheduled delays may arise. Risks can also arise following market launch due to the potential need for technical improvements which come to light only following use in reallife situations or through continuous operation. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.369987124262159,,,,,,

498,Rheinmetall counters potential production risks by applying high technical safety and process standards at its plants in line with the relevant risks. We ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for the product areas through internal policies and procedural instructions as well as by establishing applying and continuously improving management systems. Our quality management systems have been certified in accordance with the internationally recognized ISO IATF and AQAP or EN standards for many years now for example. In addition methods including Six Sigma lean management and failure mode and effects analysis FMEA are used to prevent quality risks. Appropriate insurance cover is in place for warranty product liability and recall risks which is reviewed periodically and adjusted where necessary. Wherever possible the management systems are run as integrated management systems meaning that the issue of quality is linked with other issues such as the environment health and safety and energy. Risks may arise from capacity bottlenecks due to staff shortages technical disruptions excessive scrap levels lack of demand availability as a result of failures or partial failures in the supply chains or excessive reliance on individual production sites. These risks can be mitigated however through careful planning and continuous ,,0.3264008180093393,0.4988185426313385,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
499,monitoring of the production processes in conjunction with flexible working hour models. Continuous improvement in production for example by simplifying processes or increasing the level of automation helps to further increase production efficiency. The availability of production plants is ensured through preventive maintenance with accompanying checks and through investments and modernizations. Production may also be impacted by factors such as natural disasters disruptions in the infrastructure delivery stops or technical failure. As a countermeasure Rheinmetall operates appropriate business continuity management BCM. For potential damage and associated interruptions to operations or production downtime and for other conceivable loss occurrences and liability risks insurance cover has also been taken out as financially reasonable to ensure that the financial consequences of potential risks are contained or completely ruled out. Rheinmetall reviews investment decisions carefully over several stages. Investments that exceed a defined limit are presented to the Executive Board for approval after undergoing a review. Nevertheless unforeseen changes in general conditions can lead to higher investment costs or cause delays to facilities being commissioned. Risks may also arise from the handling of projects in terms of planning calculation and execution. This is due to the scope of major projects their long terms lasting several years and their complexity particularly at Vehicle Systems Weapon and Ammunition and Electronic Solutions. These risks include not only uncertainty in calculations but also unexpected technical andor logistical problems difficulties surrounding the fulfillment of product specifications underestimations of the level of complexity e.g. in technical implementation projectspecific additions and related cost increases capacity and supply bottlenecks as well as quality problems with business partners or suppliers unforeseeable developments during assembly and deferred dates of acceptance and settlement. These risks can be minimized though not entirely ruled out through the technical expertise and longstanding project experience of the employees professional project management verification levels for each project stage comprehensive quality management measures and the appropriate formulation of contracts. ,,0.3779629077008263,0.48445557256959326,0.3708285105269621,,0.4779098935450398,,0.3604947034080592,,,,,0.36202211119432715,,,,,,
501,The purchasing organization is controlled by the Chief Purchasing Officer CPO. It is managed via a matrix structure with the procurement units in the divisions reporting to the CPO in functional terms while there are also central units in Procurement such as Governance ESG and Commodity Management that cooperate with the divisions. One key element for managing this area is the Rheinmetall Group Purchasing Council RGP Council. All divisions are represented on the RGP Council in order to improve Rheinmetalls market position with respect to suppliers and achieve better purchasing conditions. This ranges from optimized prices to improved payment and delivery conditions. Another objective of the RGP Council is to transfer expertise and information and to ensure networking within the purchasing organization. Furthermore regular exchanges in the RGP Council ensure that the purchasing organization is adapted to changing requirements and that both organization and processes are described in sufficient detail.Within the overarching Group purchasing organization the central Governance Processes Tools organizes procurement governance for the Rheinmetallwide purchasing organization in consultation with the CPO defines the systems used within Procurement and manages and supports measures and projects for improving and further developing procurement processes and systems at Rheinmetall. Risks can arise in connection with the purchasing of raw materials parts and components in the form of unexpected supply shortages delays or bottlenecks in delivery quality problems or rising purchase prices for intermediate products raw materials and energy. This is countered through ongoing monitoring of the procurement markets structured procurement concepts and the avoidance of dependence on individual suppliers. The careful selection of efficient suppliers ongoing supplier reviews precise specifications and quality requirements reliability checks medium and longterm supply contracts bundling of volumes to be procured within the Group and appropriate safety stock levels also reduce the risk potential. Ongoing optimization of our supplier circle can leader to more favorable purchasing conditions. If new suppliers possessing for example specialized innovative product knowledge are identified our competitive situation may improve. Legal bans on substances andor materials are taken into account through appropriate measures and cooperation with other specialist areas. ,,0.3433884425171348,0.4220016620389478,,,0.33759324723815476,0.4820690384088053,,,,,,,,,,,,
502,Bottlenecks in supply and sharp fluctuations in prices for raw materials involve significant risks. Price risks for raw materials particularly aluminum copper and nickel are countered with cost escalation clauses in contracts on the sales side. When procuring raw materials that are traded on the stock market the central Commodities Office manages the timing of purchases and the volume purchased in consultation with the operating units making use of financial hedging instruments. An inadequate energy supply for the Rheinmetall companies under costefficient conditions constitutes a risk for competitive production at the sites. Electricity and gas purchases in the Rheinmetall Group are made in advance on a rolling basis over several years based on the mediumterm planning. It is not possible to ensure complete hedging of fluctuations in the price of energy sources or to guarantee that increases in energy prices will be passed on to customers. However we hold talks with our customers to make the development on the energy markets transparent and also to establish corresponding safeguard clauses. Rising energy costs are addressed by bundling procurement volumes and through coordinated invitations to tender long contract durations and optimization of the energy price via the European Energy Exchange in Leipzig. Germanys energy turnaround is expected to lead to the expansion of electricity grids and a significant increase in the share of renewable energies. We believe that constantly rising electricity prices represent a risk a development that could impact the international competitiveness of industrial companies. We have responded to this partly by investing in renewable energy generation ourselves now. Crises such as geopolitical tensions or natural disasters pose a fundamental risk to supply chains. We counter these by increasingly endeavoring to ensure transparency in the supply chain and making riskminimized decisions on the basis of these insights. Furthermore a crossdisciplinary team was already set up in the previous year to respond quickly to changes in the situation and to prevent potential losses and damages due to disruptions in the supply chain. In addition to general risks in our international procurement activities country and supplierspecific risks may also arise. This includes for example child labor the conscious acceptance of environmental damage or inadequate safety and working conditions. As part of Corporate Social Responsibility CSR such risks are ruled out with business partner reviews. In we introduced a system for analyzing human rights and environmental risks in our supply chain. This system forms the basis for the implementation of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act at suppliers . Nonfinancial aspects of business activities A comprehensive easing of the situation on the global procurement markets still is not expected as the aftereffects of the COVID pandemic are continuing and international capacity restrictions and bottlenecks in raw material procurement and energy supply continue to exist. The conflict in Eastern Europe means additional risks in relation to the security of existing supply chains. Furthermore global supply problems in the semiconductor market are ongoing. These can impact both procurement and sales. This is being counteracted with interdisciplinary teams the use of alternative and sound requirement forecasts. Rheinmetall is also exposed to logistics risks. These manifest themselves as capacity fluctuations noncompliance with transport lead times and even interruptions in the transport of goods for all modes of transport. These can have an impact on both transport costs and material availability. ,,,,0.3612507541370618,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

504,In a technologyoriented group such as Rheinmetall the implementation of the ambitious growthoriented corporate strategy the achievement of financial targets and the sustainable economic success hinges on a variety of staff including employees with an aboveaverage level of qualifications and a number of experienced specialists from a wide variety of fields. Having a high turnover of managers and employees in key positions can lead to a loss of key specialist knowledge and expertise. A shortage of skilled workers or not finding suitable management specialist and junior staff for vacant positions who have the desired commercial technical or industryspecific skills or finding them only after a delay can also have negative repercussions for the company such as an aging workforce inadequate qualifications low employee motivation or a low individual employee willingness to perform. We mitigate potential personnel risks for example by positioning Rheinmetall globally as a fair and attractive employer with a valuebased corporate culture and by using target grouporiented personnel marketing to communicate our strengths to the outside world in particular to younger people. Further elements to minimize ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3751108403030737,,,,,,
505,risks include the establishment of a restructuring unit that is able to take action globally the continuous development of competitive performancebased pay with performancebased incentive systems modern HR practices and structured training and continuing education in specific disciplines and methods based on our competency model. As an international company we also pursue a diversityoriented HR policy. The success of these measures is reflected in the high number of applications from qualified people the low fluctuation over the past few years and a relatively long average tenure within the company. Furthermore we offer a variety of flexible working time arrangements at our German sites and the option of working from home on a temporary basis which are designed to promote a healthy worklife balance. In view of an aging workforce and the potential resulting skills shortage age structure analyses in addition to key function analyses are conducted at regular intervals as part of Generation Management the results of the analyses are taken into account in forwardlooking staff and departmentspecific succession planning and training activities. We counteract the demographic change in particular through funding suitable programs for young people knowledge management and occupational health management organized on a Groupwide basis. The companies of Rheinmetall AG face intense competition in attracting qualified employees. Our growth driven by innovation and the transformation of civilian business are changing the requirements for the available expertise in research and development as well as production. Our companies are already discovering that it is becoming more difficult to attract engineers with specialist knowledge in the fields of software and electrical engineering throughout the world. Generally this situation will get worse as the pressure to innovate in the industry as a whole will increase. Capacity adjustments potential efficiency enhancement measures and possible restructuring or reorganization that may be necessary to safeguard longterm competitiveness often require a reconciliation of interests at operating level. We endeavor to limit the negative impact of such measures on the workforce wherever possible and to make any job cuts that may become necessary in a socially responsible manner. We traditionally work constructively with employee representatives at our sites. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.37537358386950803,,,,,,
507,Rheinmetalls business situation financial position and performance are exposed to financial risks from operating activities. The main financial risks are liquidity risks counterparty risks and market price risks arising from changes in interest rates exchange rates or raw material prices. Liquidity risk is the risk that existing or future payment obligations cannot be met cannot be met on time or can be met only with excessive costs. To manage this risk all cash transactions are recorded assessed and centrally aggregated within the scope of corporate planning and rolling monthly twelvemonth liquidity plans. The values calculated are compared with the available financial scope to identify any potential financing gaps early on. Scenarios such as catastropherelated sales slumps and payment defaults unexpected working capital requirements or reductions in credit facilities are simulated taking into account worstcase scenarios. When determining the necessary financial scope Rheinmetall takes great care to ensure that adequate reserves are held at all times. Counterparty risks arise in connection with deposits financing commitments or financial receivables such as positive fair values from hedging transactions as a result of the relevant counterpartys inability to pay or insolvency. Rheinmetall manages these risks through limitbased creditworthinesslinked and widely diversified lending from commercial banks. Financial transactions are conducted exclusively with banking or insurance partners that have an investment grade rating from recognized rating agencies or comparable credit ratings. Moreover in the allocation of business emphasis is placed on ensuring that in addition to sufficient diversification of the counterparties themselves diversification is pursued at country level as well. Default risks from the operating business can generally be assessed as low on account of the customer structure. In the case of largevolume or longterm business relations potential counterparty risks are individually analyzed and managed by means of prepayments milestone payments guarantees letters of credit or credit default swaps and special individual contractual frameworks. There are no customer or country dependencies that could jeopardize the continued existence of the Rheinmetall Group if they were to take a negative turn. ,,,,,,,,,,,0.4176315575838608,,,,,,,,
514,Compliance violations can cause many different types of damage and can have serious consequences such as the discontinuation of business relationships exclusion from contract awards negative assessments on capital markets the imposition of fines the absorption of profits claims for damages and civil or criminal proceedings. Furthermore compliance violations that have a high public profile always pose the risk of significant and lasting damage to the companys reputation. Customers shareholders employees nongovernmental organizations rating agencies and also the general public could lose trust in our company. In itself the examination and clarification of alleged cases can result in considerable internal and external costs. Compliance risks can occur in every area of the company. The compliance organization therefore aims to ensure proper and compliant modes of conduct and behavior on the part of a company and its employees and to make sure that potential or actual infringements of external or internal regulations are responded to appropriately. Groupwide structures stringent regulations and standardized processes are put in place as far as possible to prevent any liability risks risks of a penalty or a fine and reputation risks in addition to other financial disadvantages loss or damage that the company may incur as a result of misconduct or violations of the law. The regular execution of a Groupwide compliance risk assessment topdown and bottomup and additional regular and casebycase risk analyses help to identify systemic and companyspecific compliance risks. Measures to introduce or improve international or local structures guidelines processes IT systems and training content are derived from the results. However despite extensive and multilevel inspection and control mechanisms the possibility of risks arising from unlawful activities of individual parties cannot be ruled out. Alleged cases are investigated actively. In investigative proceedings we cooperate with the relevant authorities. Proven misconduct results in consequences for those involved and if necessary to adjustments in the organization. However the financial impact of compliance cases on the Groups results is very difficult to estimate. Depending on the case and the circumstances a considerable range is to be assumed. The introduction in of the EU General Data Protection Regulation GDPR required EUbased companies also to meet a whole range of obligations concerning data protection. Violations of the GDPR are subject to significant sanctions including the imposition of fines totaling up to of the Groups total global sales. To counter these risks we established a Groupwide data security management system DSMS to ensure a data protection level that is structured secure and as far as possible standardized. It defines a range of functions and responsibilities and undergoes continuous improvement as part of a plandocheckact cycle. The effectiveness of the DSMS is monitored on an ongoing basis. Where legally prescribed data protection officers are appointed in Rheinmetall. Our employees receive regular instruction and training in matters relating to data protection. The content of data protection training is adapted for individual departments in line with the specific requirements in their respective spheres of work. For new employees this training is an important part of the induction process. The introduction of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act LkSG in has given rise to new additional due diligence requirements for Rheinmetall that are intended to ensure compliance with specific environmental and human rights standards. With the help of corresponding risk management systems for its own business the supply chain and the Social Compliance Officer Rheinmetall ensures that the LkSG requirements are implemented lawfully. ,,,,,,,,,,0.30422207536110707,,,,,0.36234987523385,,,,

Shareholders customers lenders employees the media and the public at large are informed regularly transparently and quickly about our social and financial status our key processes and changes as well as the latest news and developments. ,,,,,,,,,,0.32205024773461066,,,,,,,,,
519,Sustainability risks nonfinancial risks differ in part from traditional risk assessments in terms of the timescale considered the assessment of their impact but also in perspective. For this reason the process for sustainability risk reporting builds on the existing risk management modules but goes beyond them in parts. Potential sustainability risks are identified and assessed both at Group level and in the divisions as part of the risk management system. In addition to the safety of our products protecting our employees and the environment and respecting and safeguarding human rights in our own business activities and in business relationships along the value chain are high priorities. Misconduct and noncompliance with legal requirements or the Groups own standards may have effects such as personal injury environmental property and reputational damage production downtime and interruptions to operations and the obligation to pay damages. This also includes the risk of releasing hazardous substances as a result of a failure in production the obligation to remove contamination and risks from the area of compliance with human rights and from potentially addressing these insufficiently. With our principles standards and measures we ensure that our requirements are communicated appropriately and implemented in the best possible way. If we do not comply with the increasing regulatory requirements and fail to meet the expectations and requirements of governments customers investors lenders and other financial institutions in the areas of environmental and social responsibility and governance ESG to the required extent or level of detail this can have a negative impact on the Rheinmetall Groups business and earnings. Customers could potentially refuse to award contracts to us private and institutional investors might refuse to include us in their portfolio and financial institutes might refuse to issue loans at all or only at an increased cost. We counter these risks through comprehensive and transparent ESG reporting based on globally recognized standards such as the Global Reporting Initiative and where possible through continuous improvement of our customer and ESG ratings from internationally renowned agencies and institutions e.g. MSCI ISS ESG Sustainalytics VigeoEiris ESG Book CDP and EcoVadis. Furthermore the passing of legislation or regulations for the finance sector could cause institutional investors to restructure their portfolios and reduce or terminate their exposures in companies that operate in industries classed as critical. Possible sector exclusions e.g. for the weapons and defence industry could also limit our options to raise capital. Changes to the qualification criteria for being accepted to or remaining on stock indices could also harbor risks for our company. Business activities that touch on sensitive ESG topics could result in a negative response among stakeholders or trigger negative media reports which could damage our reputation and jeopardize the achievement of our business goals. This impact could potentially be exacerbated by insufficient crisis communication. The protection of human rights is an integral part of our social responsibility and anchored in our Group guidelines such as the Code of Conduct the Supplier Code of Conduct the principles of social responsibility and the policy statement in accordance with the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. Rheinmetall aims to prevent the negative consequences of its business activities and in the supply chain impacting its ability to uphold human rights. It is a matter of course for us to identify human rights risks including environmental risks associated with our business activities and sphere of influence through for example adequate due diligence processes and risk analyses and to mitigate these risks as far as possible through suitable measures. In addition to the direct risk of sanctions violations of our own commitments or of laws or corporate policies also entail strategic and operational risks and pose a reputational risk. ,,,0.43949077196950787,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
520,With locations worldwide we are subject during our everyday business to a wide range of legal and regulatory requirements any of which can be updated developed or made stricter at ever shorter notice. This applies in particular to provisions relating to not only the environment chemicals hazardous substances and critical raw materials but also occupational and health protection. It also includes regulations relating to air soil and water pollution and waste disposal all of which have recently been made stricter by new legislation particularly in the European Union and the US. Adapting to new requirements could increase operating costs or require unscheduled investments. A whole range of different licenses and approvals are also required for our locations and factories and their provisions have to be met which are subject to renewal amendment suspension and revocation by the issuing authority. Violations of relevant official regulations that apply to how we exercise our business activities or infringement of social occupational safety and environmental standards could harm Rheinmetalls reputation and subsequently result in internal or external investigations requirements remediation obligations claims for damages and under certain circumstances substantial fines or penalties. We actively counter these risks in various ways including through high technical standards integrated management systems and certification in accordance with international standards such as ISO ISO and ISO . We evaluate measures that go above and beyond compliance with legal requirements on a cost benefit basis. Although we have organizational structures and procedures in place to ensure that we comply with applicable government regulations in the conduct of our business it cannot be entirely ruled out that violations of applicable government regulations could occur on our part or on the part of third parties with whom we have a contractual relationship and whose actions could be attributed to us. A large amount of land owned by the Rheinmetall Group has been subject to industrial usage for decades. For this reason it cannot be ruled out that contamination for example as a result of production processes or processes to test munitions has also been generated during this time that Rheinmetall is not yet aware of. Accounting provisions have been recognized for necessary measures to safeguard against or clean up identified pollution. The elimination of leaks or the cleanup of effects resulting from technical failure could give rise to direct costs for the company. It is possible that the relevant authorities may issue regulations that require costly cleanup measures. We counter potential environmental risks by implementing statutory environmental standards certified environmental management systems proper and safe storage of hazardous substances and environmentally friendly disposal of waste and hazardous materials via certified service providers. At our different locations special organizational units ensure that the relevant legislation and regulations are observed and that further technical options for mitigating environmental risks are identified. The tightening of environmental protection provisions and environmental standards could lead to additional unplanned costs and liability risks over which Rheinmetall would have no influence. For certain environmental risks we have taken out liability insurance policies with coverage amounts that we consider customary and appropriate for the industry. Losses could be incurred from environmental damage that exceed the insured amounts or are not covered by insurance. Risks attributable to climate change are currently already beginning to emerge. These can be chronic and acute physical risks such as the rise in average temperature rising sea levels extreme weather events sharply fluctuating water levels increasing heat waves and droughts affecting property. With regard to production sites production interruptions delivery delays or delivery failures represent significant risks. These may be exacerbated by more intense and frequent extreme weather events such as tornadoes and severe flooding. Transitory risks from climate change arise from crosssector structural change due to the transition to a lowercarbon economy. They relate in particular to changes in the legal framework and tighter limits at national or transnational level. These include for example increasing efforts by legislators to introduce CO,,0.3976347028463008,0.49988640182716915,0.32307233992324147,0.42939438565576216,0.3740993484475848,,,,,,,,,0.3094447043273164,,,,

In addition environmental opportunities and risks with regard to the climate are analyzed and assessed each year as part of reporting to the British nongovernment organization CDP and are reported publicly to customers and investors. With regard to the disclosure requirements for the EU Taxonomy Regulation which were expanded significantly in the year under review we consider ourselves to be well prepared and do not anticipate any additional risks although we do not anticipate any significant opportunities either. In accordance with this frameworks requirements we disclose the economic activities with which we contribute to reducing greenhouse emissions in the industry and the extent of their effects in this regard. We also strive to make our investments sustainable by developing specifications to integrate sustainability in the investment process right from the start taking account of thresholds. ,,,0.4187172397848408,0.3443162183070403,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
526,As a company that receives orders from the public sector we sometimes gain access to a range of confidential information and material that are rated as classified. The specific requirements regarding the personnel and material security measures vary depending on the degree of confidentiality. Material confidentiality relates to the technical and organizational precautions taken in the company to protect classified information. This involves measures relating to for example the creation labeling processing duplication management storage transportation and forwarding of classified information as well as to the security of IT systems. Only persons who have undergone state security screening to prove their dependability and been issued with authorization to handle classified information are permitted access to classified information. Like any other multinational company Rheinmetall is at constant risk of cyberattacks and risks resulting from industrial espionage or sabotage. The risks especially those resulting from cyberattacks have intensified as a result of the war in Ukraine. We are unable to fully ensure that the personnel organizational electronic structural and technical precautionarysecurity measures that we implement to protect confidential commercial information data and material as well as our own intellectual property are sufficient and successful. Incidents can have a negative impact on our reputation competitiveness or business situation which is why it is important for us to raise awareness among our employees about the careful handling of all businessrelated information. Audits and the implementation of corresponding awareness measures are therefore essential. Potential risks associated with business trips and business stays abroad e.g. health risks and security risks through criminality or terrorism are countered primarily through preventive measures. The latest information concerning the security situation in the destination countries is thoroughly evaluated and appraised potentially resulting in travel warnings or even travel bans being announced by the Groups management. To provide our employees with not only detailed security safety and medical advice but also all the support they need before during and after business trips we work together with the International SOS organization which runs a global network supporting business travelers and expatriates in the event of illness accidents civil unrest or other incidents occurring abroad. A locationspecific combination of personnel and organizational measures involving various structural and mechanical property protection and electronic monitoring systems is designed to prevent unauthorized persons from accessing the company premises andor buildingsbuilding sections and potentially endangering employees business partners and visitors or even causing them harm. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.40018962141739894,,,,,,

528,Information and data are exposed to constantly growing threats with regard to availability confidentiality and integrity. The organizational and IT networking of locations and complex systems as well as the growing need for remote access for customers and employees are causing risks to arise. In addition the use of new forms of technology e.g. cloud technology softwaredefined networks presents opportunities that entail further risks. The use of licensed or selfcreated software can also harbor potential risks if the license agreements which are subject to constant amendment are not observed. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.343059206629597,,,,,,
529,Disruptions to or the failure of applicationcritical IT systems IT applications and infrastructure components can severely restrict the management of business and production processes and cause serious harm to the business. External influences or incorrect programming and operation or even manipulation can also expose data to the risk of being falsified destroyed spied on or stolen. Blackmail attempts through the installation of ransomware can repeatedly be seen in the press. Rheinmetalls civilian sector was impacted by a global IT incident in April . It was mainly the companys activities addressing industrial customers particularly in the automotive sector that were affected. By taking action systematically huge damage to Rheinmetall could be avoided. Large parts of the infrastructure were temporarily unavailable due to measures initiated immediately although some systems were not at risk. For example backup and businesscritical systems were protected and not at risk. The systems affected or at risk were systematically reestablished and equipped with additional security measures. Customers service providers and also public authorities were kept informed promptly and comprehensively throughout the entire duration of the reestablishment process. The measures have been completed globally. Due to the continuously growing dangers we as a company find ourselves confronted with significantly increased regulatory and legislative requirements. The installed software and hardware meet from a Group perspective the latest technological standards as a result of regular investment and security updates. Appropriate backup and recovery procedures are also implemented along with virus scanners and firewalls to avert risks. We are also strengthening our processes and technologies for monitoring our networks and systems so that we can identify anomalies or attacks early on. The technical configuration functional security structures and efficient operation of the IT architecture are reviewed on a regular basis with competent service providers certified to ISO and are continuously improved and adapted to the changing regulatory and legislative requirements. The level of protection is implemented and operated uniformly for the entire Rheinmetall company across all divisions. Ensuring the availability reliability and confidentiality of data is a top priority. In addition process harmonization is required in some areas of the business to provide a further basis for standardization and harmonization of IT in the future. The extensive IT insourcing program launched in fiscal was continued in as well. As a result of the abovementioned IT incident in April and the shortterm focus on restoring operability in the civilian sector the time planning for the IT insourcing program has been postponed. The continued aim of the program is to once again offer all core IT areas of expertise in full within the company in the medium term. Establishing new structures can temporarily result in additional risks. Furthermore there is a conflict within IT between establishing operability and growth. The planned and adhoc resource requirements push the focus onto operability. Based on the current availability of resources and business requirements the focus is be on operability. Core action areas here include transition stabilization and IT governance. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3902162823220289,,,,,,

539,Under the umbrella of Rheinmetall AG the structure of the Rheinmetall Group consisting of Vehicle Systems Weapon and Ammunition Electronic Solutions Sensors and Actuators and Materials and Trade aims to leverage the existing strengths and synergies within the company and to take advantage of the related opportunities. The business policy is geared towards maintaining and expanding our current business liberties and financial flexibility. The goal is to ensure the longterm and economically successful existence of Rheinmetall for the benefit of all stakeholders. Opportunities that present themselves must be identified early and systematically and the accompanying potential for success must be exploited in order to be able to continue growing sustainably in dynamic markets. To this end market industry and technology trends are continually monitored including as part of integrated strategy and planning processes and target markets are analyzed intensively and assessed in terms of their strategic and economic significance for the Rheinmetall Groups areas of business. To identify and initially assess opportunities and success potential the operating units are closely linked with functions at Group level including Corporate Strategy and Development and Research Technology and Innovation. At a functional level a structured process has been established to specifically identify new opportunities and technological potential evaluate them in a structured manner and transfer them to business areas that can be commercialized via program management. The operating units are involved in this process at a very early stage in order to increase the probability of success of the business ideas and to support the projects and programs during implementation. Potential for current business operations is managed among other things in regular review sessions between the Executive Board and the heads of the divisions and central departments. Based on an examination of structured assessments of market industry and competition data discussions focus on economic market industry and sales developments as well as the competitive situation and technological trends. The next step involves defining strategic initiatives and operational measures that are aimed at realizing the potential opportunities that have been identified. This can entail a reallocation of budgets that are provided for exploiting opportunities. In addition the opportunities that arise are logged and evaluated as part of the forecast prepared three times a year. Opportunities and potential success deemed strategically important for the medium and long term are included in the threeyear mediumterm corporate planning on the one hand and on the other discussed at the annual Groupwide global strategy meeting the semiannual product planning day and division strategy meetings for periods beyond this horizon where they are assessed and prioritized in terms of their significance for future business development and assigned a budget if necessary. As a technology group we follow and promote continual product and technology innovations and their modifications.

552,Vehicle Systems is well positioned to participate successfully in the tenders for major European military vehicle programs in the medium to long term. Before the outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine we anticipated demand for around mediumweight and heavy tracked vehicles in Germany and for approximately in Europe. For light and mediumweight wheeled vehicles as well as medium and heavy protected wheeled and tracked vehicles we estimated demand in Germany and Europe at over units. Oversees particularly in Australia and the USA we estimated more than additional tracked vehicles and at least the same number of protected wheeled vehicles. There is also strong growth in demand in the artillery sector. An increase in tactical vehicles also requires adjustment of the associated necessary logistics. It is therefore no surprise that demand for allterrain military trucks is also rising exponentially. With regard to logistics vehicles there are upcoming fleet regenerations comprising several tens of thousands of units particularly on the European markets and in the US. In the markets relevant for Rheinmetall we forecast market potential for military vehicles of well over million over the next few years. Against the backdrop of the war in Eastern Europe this potential and the underlying vehicle unit figures are likely to increase further. ,,,,,,,,0.37207248672794413,,,,,,,,,,,

Under the umbrella term of decarbonization Rheinmetall has begun to address a diversified business area with high growth potential for the civil sector. Transferability to the defence sector is also being assessed and opens up further growth potential. Within decarbonization warm home and hydrogen technologies are focus areas for Rheinmetall. In the warm home area the focus is on the development and supply of components such as circulation pumps heating pumps and compressors as Rheinmetall has extensive technological and development expertise. ,,0.33792022244727715,0.40173773604156415,0.3363122033150765,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
576,The Rheinmetall Groups internal control system related to the accounting process includes all principles procedures and measures which ensure by both organizational and technical means that all business processes and transactions are recorded in the accounting system promptly accurately and consistently. In addition to defined control mechanisms e.g. manual coordination processes and technical coordination processes for systems this includes the separation of administrative executive settlement and approval functions together with guidelines and operating instructions. Changes to the economic legal and regulatory environment of the Rheinmetall Group are analyzed to determine whether adjustments to the accountingrelated control system are necessary. Accounting guidelines Our IFRS accounting guidelines cover all the regulations of the International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS that are of relevance to Rheinmetall AG. They explain the IFRS regulations and specify accounting procedures. The guidelines must be observed by all companies included in the consolidated financial statements thereby ensuring standardized accounting. The accounting guidelines are reviewed at least once a year and amended where necessary. Companies are informed about specific changes to guidelines. The content of the guidelines is the responsibility of the main Accounting department of Rheinmetall AG. ,,0.35625230418264664,0.40333719497090553,,0.3666720803507028,,0.43689282892862685,,,0.33839182094439524,,,,,,,,,
578,Accounting processes in companies included in the consolidated financial statements It is the responsibility of the management of the respective companies to prepare the financial statements of companies included in the consolidated financial statements. The accounts and financial statements are prepared using SAPbased accounting systems SAPFI. Procedures such as document checks for formal and material correctness the separation of functions and ITbased plausibility checks are implemented in the accounting process to ensure the correctness of the accounts and financial statements. The management of each Group company monitors compliance with IFRS accounting guidelines and other guidelines and operating instructions in force across the Group. The management must confirm the correctness of the financial statements in a corresponding declaration. Consolidation and Group accounting process The main Accounting department of Rheinmetall AG is responsible for central management of the Group accounting process. It stipulates the schedule for the consolidated financial statements and monitors compliance with deadlines. The consolidated financial statements of Rheinmetall AG are drawn up with the aid of the consolidation software SAP SEMBCS. A standardized binding chart of accounts is incorporated into this system which covers virtually all the information required for the IFRS consolidated financial statements of Rheinmetall AG. The individual companies record the financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS accounting guidelines in the consolidation software. After this IFRS singleentity financial statement data is recorded it then undergoes an automatic plausibility check and systembased validation. If error or warning messages are displayed during this process these are to be analyzed and dealt with by the person responsible for the singleentity financial statements. Employees in the main Accounting department then perform additional automatic and manual checks. The manual and automated consolidation measures undergo systembased checks and automatic plausibility checks. The consolidated financial statements are also audited on the basis of standardized reports using comparisons of target and actual performance trend and deviation analyses and detailed evaluations. A check is carried out every quarter to ensure the completeness of the scope of consolidation. The auditors examine the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report to determine whether they comply with applicable accounting regulations and other relevant provisions. The auditors check whether the IFRS accounting guidelines have been applied to the financial statements prepared for consolidation purposes and establish the correctness of the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with applicable accounting principles. The audit procedures performed by these auditors also include an assessment of the effectiveness of the accountingrelated internal control system based on spot checks in subdivisions. ,,0.3388634690285664,,,0.38660568041967225,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From our perspective environmental protection and conservation play a major role in ensuring we have a sustainable future that is worth living. The careful use of natural resources is part of how the Rheinmetall Group views itself. Using raw materials and energy economically and avoiding environmental damage in business and production processes are also among the key foundations on which the Group companies business activities are based as is dealing with residual materials and emissions responsibly.

668,We need a sufficient energy supply which is associated with corresponding CO emissions to manufacture our products and operate our buildings and infrastructure. The reduction of energyrelated payments is therefore a key component of corporate policy in the Rheinmetall Group. It is a material objective for us to reduce energy consumption and increase energy efficiency through stringent processes in daytoday operations within the context of that which is technically feasible and economic circumstances. Our responsibility in dealing with energy resources requires the achievement and review of specific targets for energy savings and improvements in energy efficiency where it is technically and organizationally feasible and where it makes economic sense in addition to the systematic determination analysis and measurement of the energy aspects of significance for our business models. We select our energy resources based on supply reliability economic efficiency and environmental considerations and use a mix of nonrenewable and renewable energies during our everyday business. In July the newly established Strategic Energy Procurement department commenced its activities. Its aim is to develop the foundations for uniform economical safe and sustainable energy procurement within the Rheinmetall Group. By creating its own energy supply from renewable sources and procuring energy from solar and wind power plants the new unit will make an important contribution towards the Groups carbon neutrality. ,,0.3270850094335135,,0.4112173571495193,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
670,The great tasks of today include containing climate change as far as possible and achieving an alignment to its consequences and impact. As a company with a sense of responsibility and with a global value added chain Rheinmetall attaches great significance to this global challenge. The core of the matter is avoidance reduction substitution and compensation of the CO emissions produced by the Rheinmetall Group in Scopes and . Rheinmetalls Scope and Scope targets are based on the Paris Climate Agreement. For the year under review we prepared a carbon footprint in accordance with the internationally recognized Greenhouse Gas Protocol for the second time. It distinguishes between three categories of emissions. At our locations direct emissions into the air Scope arise from the combustion of fossil energy sources particularly natural gas. Indirect emissions Scope cover all emissions that are associated with purchased energy such as electricity. Scope emissions are indirect emissions that occur in the valueadded chain. In the eight upstream and seven downstream categories these relate to the procurement of goods and services manufacturing of products production processes and transport and logistics. ,,,0.3979563351119676,0.3205114609335991,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

677,in the composition of the Group. Around of carbon emissions at the Rheinmetall Group can be attributed to the top companies alone. COe for fiscal was calculated using the locationbased and marketbased method. Scope emissions for have been calculated using emission factors from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change database. Scope locationbased emissions were calculated using emission factors from the International Energy Agency. Scope marketbased emissions were calculated based on availability using emission factors from energy suppliers at the location level. When this data is not available the databases of the Association of Issuing Bodies the International Energy Agency and the United States Environmental Protection Agency have been used. The emissions for refrigerants were calculated using the global warming potential in accordance with the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. The data in these two tables were determined on the basis of internal processes. They come from existing management systems and are based on meter readings or invoice amounts if available in each case and assumptionbased projections by the companies. The data are requested in the operating units collected with care and processed. Nevertheless errors cannot be entirely ruled out in the collection processing or transmission. In the reporting year a review was carried out of the original intention to join the Science Based Targets Initiative SBTi. After analyzing the data evaluating the results and conclusions and taking into account our business model the Executive Board decided not to join SBTi but to adopt an approach based on the SBTi methodology in order to achieve our goal of no longer generating any climatedamaging carbon emissions by for Scope and net. In the first phase we refer to our own emissions Scope and energy supplier emissions Scope . To do this the company will invest primarily in improving the energy efficiency of its locations and production facilities and develop and expand internal power generation from renewable sources. To this end new photovoltaic systems were installed at locations in Spain South Africa and Australia in the past fiscal year. In the medium to long term the CO emissions in Scope are also to be reduced. ,,,,0.3885201799277147,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

681,Calculations of Scope emissions have been carried out for categories since . This data will be audited for the first time in by Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft Munich Düsseldorf branch. The emissions attributable to the categories Purchased goods and services and Use of products sold accounted for over of total Scope emissions. Therefore only these categories will be reported in . The companies are accounted for using the operational control approach. All purchased goods and services in the fiscal year were assessed separately by product and supplier group using the corresponding exiobase expenditurebased emission factors. Emissions in Use of products sold were calculated using the emission factors of the Department for Environment Food Rural Affairs and the Association of Issuing Bodies based on the German electricity mix. The lifetimes and operating times were assumed to depend on the end products. The share of emissions per Rheinmetall product was calculated as the relative share of emissions by weight of the intermediate product in relation to the total weight of the end product. In addition to assessing the risk analysis reports from an insurance company on our Defence production facilities prepared using the NatCat data platform on the basis of extensive and detailed data from an external risk data provider a total of around production sites were examined and assessed in respect to various risk types physical risks acutechronic with nine and ten categories respectively transitory risks with six categories and socioeconomic risks with two categories. The results will be taken into account in business continuity management e.g. for the development of adequate and longterm protective measures as well as for preventive measures.

A farreaching prohibition order for the public no traditional agricultural use and the size of the sprawling areas make this companyowned squarekilometer site which encompasses hectares of forest and hectares of heathland in an otherwise relatively densely populated Germany a rather special nature reserve. Active landscaping and forestry management creates individual habitats for the unique fauna and flora. The result is an unusually rich array of flora which in turn attracts a rare diversity of insects and birds and also provides a habitat for large wild animal populations. For biodiversity and climate protection peatlands are very important. In September the Federal Ministry for the Environment published a National Peatland Strategy which includes voluntary rewetting measures. Wetlands and peatlands serve as the habitat for highly specialized animal and plant species whose alignment to the environment have made them rare and endangered. With their water absorption capacity the moorlands fulfill important functions in regulating temperature and moisture. In fiscal a project analysis was carried out by an engineering firm on the companys premises in Unterlüss to determine the basics survey and sound the Kiehnmoor and determine the current water balance and peat thickness of the peatland. Based on this the necessary measures were determined and a concept for possible rewetting was developed. An area of moorland in the immediate vicinity of the Kiehnmoor is also to be rewetted. In the year under review exploratory talks were held with the owner of the Lower Saxony State Forests on possible cooperation with the aim of exploiting synergies determining the advantages of simultaneous implementation and planning the involvement of affected neighbors. Other locations of Weapon and Ammunition in Germany and Switzerland also have extensive grounds with forests and green spaces. They therefore offer ideal conditions for continuous ecological upgrading and natureoriented design. Following mapping and initial assessments comprehensive concepts and action plans for the ecological optimization of the company premises were developed by specialist companies in the year under review. It is planned to successively and purposefully develop the ecological potential of the sites in terms of the flora and fauna over the next few years through ecological enhancement measures for wetland habitats forest habitats open land areas and by creating optimal networking opportunities for these diverse habitats. The implementation of the measures will be professionally monitored by external institutions and the success of the measures will be documented and subjected to an independent performance review. Our South African subsidiary Rheinmetall Denel Munition is also engaged in protecting nature and species at risk of extinction at three of its four production sites. Similar to in Unterlüss large demarcated safety areas far from ,0.36827274115427755,,,,0.35455435095272103,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

704,Rheinmetalls success depends to a great extent on the ideas expertise motivation and commitment of its employees. The Rheinmetall Group is faced with increasingly tough competition from other companies to gain qualified personnel. Acquiring skilled employees for the companies is therefore a key task in our HR work. In addition to performancebased remuneration and progressive benefits we attach particular importance to having a wide spectrum of career opportunities on offer in the Rheinmetall Group companies. Further training assuming responsibility and promotion opportunities have a high degree of relevance for the commitment and satisfaction of our employees. We offer interdisciplinary career paths deployment opportunities to international locations and tailored training opportunities for individual professional and personal development. A customerfocused corporate culture based on the values of respect trust and openness and in which the performance and commitment of each individual is appreciated is a key requirement for being attractive as an employer. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.42698633546953807,,,,0.2261109036632304,,
706,The growing shortage of skilled personnel across all occupational groups and industries is slowing innovation competitiveness and growth of companies. In times of weak birth cohorts farreaching and broad transformation of economic structures globalization of markets and changes in the way age cohorts see themselves at work competition for management skilled and junior staff and experienced specialists will intensify further. Finding and retaining enough qualified and suitable employees will be one of the particular challenges of the coming years. In addition to our intensive activities in apprenticeship marketing our existing marketing measures have been further strengthened at selected universities in the fields of engineering electrical engineering and information technology. Personnel marketing measures have also been expanded to include additional communication channels. With a view to our key target groups of engineers IT professionals and skilled workers we drew attention to our company as an attractive employer by placing HR image ads in trade and quality media digital and print. Throughout Germany we were also increasingly represented at HR recruiting and trade shows aimed at the professional groups of engineers IT professionals and soldiers.

712,future viability of the Rheinmetall Group in consideration of additional demographic factors and the shortage of specialist staff that is expected in many places the development of employees talented management trainees and experienced specialist and managerial staff in line with current and future requirements constitutes a key factor for the companys success. Thus strategic personnel planning is aligned to securing and continuously raising the high skill levels to ensure that the Group companies can achieve their business goals. Annual appraisal interviews between management and employees are deployed to talk about performance targets and individual development options. A range of training opportunities are in place to support Rheinmetall employees with planning their own development achieving individual learning objectives and expanding their skills to meet the requirements of their current positions or to obtain new positions. Personnel development and training activities are offered on the basis of regular needs assessments. Various sources are used for needs assessment. These include not only the results of the potential assessment and personnel development appraisals which are conducted in accordance with the collective agreement on training but also Groupwide successor planning the targetsetting process and capacity and investment planning. Further training objectives are also derived from strategic objectives such as the increased internationalization of the Group and the transformation of the previous automotive supply business. Rheinmetall offers suitable talented people who have chosen one of the expert project and management career paths individually tailored programs that promote the development of junior managers. In this way top performers and employees with potential at the various career levels are successively prepared to take on positions in a management or expert function. The training programs are based on the Rheinmetall competency model which maps the four levels of Shape the future Empower People Develop the Business and Strive for Excellence. Employees are offered a wide range of training opportunities to plan their personal development achieve individual learning goals and expand their skills for their current or future positions. The provision of personnel development and qualification measures is based on regular needs assessments. The Rheinmetall Academy in Düsseldorf is the center for exchange and further training. It offers not only classroom training but also blended learning and remote training. It forms the framework for personnel and management development and offers Groupwide training programs in the form of training courses seminars and workshops for employees and managers. In addition to seminars and events with external trainers inhouse training and qualification measures are designed and carried out here that are specifically tailored to Rheinmetalls needs. In the year under review employees men women attended previous year oneday or multiday events at the Rheinmetall Academy compared with men women in the previous year. The proportion of female participants was around as in the previous year.

725,The percentage of women occupying management positions in our technology group remains lower than in other industries or branches of industry. Generally the security and defence as well as automotive sectors are preferred by men who predominantly tend to choose technical or scientific subjects for study and professional training. In the year under review the proportion of female applicants is naturally relatively low at . Despite the difficult initial situation which is inherent to the industry the goals which have been pursued for several years now in the area of diversity which include recruiting more women to work at Rheinmetall supporting female talents more strongly and increasing the overall number of women at all levels are being advanced by a mix of strategic and operating measures. Together with Diversity Recruiting and Employer Branding the Human Resources department at the Rheinmetall Group develops systematic recruitment approaches training concepts and personnel development measures designed to ensure a fair share of women in management and through which it also prepares itself for future management tasks. Gradually increasing the share of woman among the high potentials will result in increasing the proportion of women in management positions without specifying a fixed ratio for the share of women. Female young potentials are encouraged in a targeted fashion and are supported in setting ambitious professional objectives and to continue pursuing them across any family phases. Here Rheinmetall is accommodating with familyfriendly work conditions. In the past fiscal year the share of women in the national and international Young Manager Program was and respectively and and in the two Manager Leadership Programs. The international community of female employees at Rheinmetall is organized under the womenRheinmetall network. The platform offers its over members from more than countries a forum for transferring knowledge exchanging experience and providing advice and support in professional matters including through training and virtual Talk Learn events.

Once again the focus here is on developing existing strengths and potential. It is vital here that workstations are individually adapted to the type and degree of disability enabling further employment with physical disabilities or easing reintegration into normal working life. In the year under review the Germanbased Rheinmetall Group companies employed severely disabled people previous year who are represented by the Group representative body for severely disabled employees.

739,Rheinmetall is aware of its responsibility toward its employees and strives to ensure that the working environment is safe healthy and clean. The Group ensures occupational and health protection at the workplace within the context of the national provisions in place at its various locations. Workplaces are designed in accordance with the legally and generally recognized safety and industrial medicine regulations thereby allowing everyone to perform their work without incident and without being subjected to undue stress and strain. The importance of occupational safety for Rheinmetall is emphasised by the inclusion of the Lost Time Incident Rate LTIR in the remuneration of Executive Board members since . From this key figure will also be included in the remuneration of managers. Each and every employee of the Rheinmetall Group is obligated to familiarize themselves with all the relevant safety regulations and to observe these in their own working area diligently and at all times in the interests of not only themselves but also the company as a whole. Rheinmetall is committed to minimizing to the greatest extent possible all risks and hazards that could potentially endanger the health and safety of employees and third parties. Through continuous improvements in the workplace environment suitable measures e.g. ergonomic aids and protective equipment and a broad range of prevention programs and healthpromoting measures Rheinmetall seeks to maintain and promote the health performance and satisfaction of its employees. During the course of the year employees benefit from not only medical checkups but also a range of prevention programs. The spectrum includes everything from free vaccinations and regular health checkups through internal and external sporting opportunities and consulting services to medically appropriate reintegration following a period of long illness. In the fastmoving and complex working world of a technology group economic success depends heavily on the human factor. One of the challenges of health management is to improve the wellbeing adaptability and resilience of our employees. With the Think Healthy Committee we are focusing even more strongly on promoting the health of our employees creating a Groupwide platform through which the existing activities of our companies in Germany and abroad can be bundled and managed throughout the Group. The Global Health Manager works together with the divisional health coordinators who are particularly responsible for regulating supraregional issues and the local health coordinators who are in turn organized into local steering committees. The aim is to create uniform structures actively manage the implementation of targeted measures create a common understanding of healthy leadership and support healthpromoting action. Based on this fields of action are continuously identified and measures defined. In November the second Groupwide workshop was held ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3496700662567695,,,,0.30950075264171945,,

Many employees want to take greater account of individual life stages and specific life situations in their working life and wish to create a healthier balance between their professional goals and their family and private interests through more flexible working hours. For us it is important to support our employees with a familyfriendly HR policy. In addition to working time models with varying weekly working hours the offerings that allow everyone more flexible time and thus greater freedom include various parttime options trustbased working hours and the option of working on a mobile basis for a certain number of working days per month.

In October the completely revised Supplier Code of Conduct . which is aligned with the requirements of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act was published as a binding component of contracts with suppliers. On this basis Rheinmetall can now act more proactively in partnership with its supplier partners to improve performance sustainability and compliance aspects in the procurement process and to achieve corporate development goals at the economic social ecological and regulatory levels. ,,,0.40078801672230535,,,,0.43917138806252054,,,,,,,,,,,,
758,The automotive industry consists of a complex network of globally active players. A distinction is made between original equipment manufacturers OEMs firsttier suppliers and second and thirdtier suppliers. Manufacturers and suppliers are closely linked in working together to develop and produce vehicles. Automotive manufacturers have been working for some time on anchoring economic ecological and social objectives vertically i.e. across all stages of the valueadded chain. These include respect of international ESG standards and ESG frameworks reduction of carbon footprint in production a higher proportion of recyclable material responsible use of substances and materials and future carbonneutral products. ,,,0.43544215129653635,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
762,Supply chains in the defence industry are characterized by very complex structures easily comprising up to eight stages for the needs of for example Rheinmetall Waffe Munition and Rheinmetall Landsysteme. The high proportion of specific materials and processes combined with a broad product range leads as is generally the case in this industry to a high proportion of single sourcing also because only a few companies throughout the world completely manufacture or command the very specific products and processes. In the defence technology industry switching to new suppliers is very costly both from a financial and timerelated perspective. The qualification of products carried out by military authorities is linked not only to the performance of the product itself but also to the manufacturing process manufacturing location and suppliers. A change of suppliers therefore automatically results in costs for requalification. The procurement business in the area of ballistic protection has the characteristics of a project i.e. it is characterized by intermittent production by our suppliers. This requires a high number of quality assurance measures. Furthermore specific legislation such as the War Weapons Control Act the Foreign Trade and Payments Act the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ITAR to cite just a few must be taken into consideration for procurement in the divisions operating in the security technology sector.

They have been connected with their sites for many years and are strongly rooted in the local community after all this is where their employees and business partners live. In some cases major customers are based there. Rheinmetall is a living breathing part of society and participates actively in it and not just in a financial sense. We get involved in the areas of education sport and culture and also provide direct support for local social projects and charitable organizations. By adding value locally we also contribute to regional development. Flourishing production sites do not only mean attractive highly skilled jobs and training places close to home but also orders for local suppliers and service providers. In addition a large part of the sales generated by the companies returns to the respective economies via the employees public sector and the shareholders.

770,Specialist working groups in the divisions deal for example with safety and environmental standards for Rheinmetall products. They are responsible for tracking new regulations and developments defining and implementing the required internal processes and conducting relevant training. Products in civilian business are subjected to extensive testing in accordance with the regulations prescribed by automotive quality and development standards. Sensors and Actuators for example uses a databasesupported process for product safety management which maps out the entire product lifecycle. Materials and Trade uses special design and simulation tools. To prove product safety in addition to tests carried out in testing facilities outside the engine engine operation tests are also carried out with customers under various stress scenarios. Internal and external audits are carried out to regularly monitor compliance with the parameters of the quality management system and the relevant processes. For the divisions operating in the field of security technology the guideline for implementing product safety sets out the basic requirements for ensuring the safety of Defence products in line with common standards and methods. The RD Internal Funds team and the Protection Systems business unit worked on further development of the Digital Product Passport DPP in the year under review. The DPP is intended in particular to drive forward the circular economy and enable new digital business models. For example information on components materials repairability and reuse as well as usage data is stored individually for each product in digital form. Key players along the value and supply chain can access this data via a unique identifier and decide how a used product can be optimally fed into further value creation from an economic and ecological perspective repair reuse recycle etc.. Rheinmetall has been actively involved in an initiative of the European Defence Agency EDA on this topic. As part of the Incubation Forum for Circular Economy in European Defence IFCEED Rheinmetall is participating in studies on the digital product passport in the defence sector. The development of environmentally friendly solutions for materials is not only being driven forward in the civilian sector of our business activities such as in Materials and Trade as part of the substitution of leadcontaining materials. Defence is also working on the materials portfolio to identify suitable alternatives to chromiumcontaining coatings for individual parts for example.

779,Sustainable finance means taking account of environmental social and governance ESG considerations when making investment decisions in the finance sector which should lead to longerterm investments in sustainable economic activities and projects. In addition to climate change mitigation the ecological aspects also include adapting to climate change and environmental factors such as preserving biodiversity avoiding pollution and the circular economy. Social parameters may for example relate to issues of inequality working conditions investments in local communities and human rights. The management of public and privatesector companies and institutions including management structures relations between employers and employees and the remuneration of managers and employees plays a crucial role when it comes to including social and environmental considerations in decisionmaking processes. One important measure of the European Union was therefore the definition of the EU Taxonomy which is intended to establish a shared understanding of the environmental sustainability of economic activities and capital expenditure. The starting point for defining an economic activity as environmentally sustainable is the six environmental objectives of the EU Taxonomy Regulation climate change mitigation climate change adaptation sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources transition to a circular economy pollution prevention and control and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. The EU Taxonomy distinguishes between taxonomyeligible economic activities which correspond to the pure description of a category and thus do not have any significance to sustainability. Economic activities are considered environmentally sustainable and thus taxonomyaligned if they make a substantial contribution to one or more of these defined environmental objectives do not significantly harm the achievement of any environmental objective do no significant harm principle DNSH and comply with minimum safeguards for occupational health and safety and human rights such as those arising from the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises or the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. All corporate activities that cannot be assigned to any category are taxonomynoneligible. Based on these complex screening criteria the extent to which products and individual measures are ecologically sustainable as defined in the EU Taxonomy Regulation is specified. Since the publication of Delegated Regulation EU by the EU Commission in June on environmental objectives to sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources transition to a circular economy pollution prevention and control protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems these are now available for all six environmental objectives defined in the EU Taxonomy Regulation. In addition to the delegated regulations on the technical screening criteria for the six environmental objectives the EU Taxonomy Regulation stipulates another delegated regulation on the taxonomyrelated disclosure obligations in accordance with Article of the EU Taxonomy Regulation which contains more detailed provisions on content methodology and presentation. ,0.36814720331067746,,0.39286512704917775,,0.4197966647879806,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
781,The recording of taxonomyrelevant economic activities was carried out using a decentralized topdown approach. The organizational structure of the Rheinmetall Group was the guiding principle here so the screening and allocation of economic activities took place at division level as well as at the level of the Rheinmetall AG Rheinmetall Real Estate Rheinmetall IT Solutions and Rheinmetall Technology Center business units. As part of this the determination was divided into three phases identification of relevant category sets allocation of economic activities taxonomy eligibility and taxonomy alignment testing. The categories were identified for all six environmental objectives. A comprehensive assessment was carried out for the final delegated regulation published by the EU Commission in June on the environmental objectives sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources transition to a circular economy pollution prevention and control and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. On this basis the relevant categories with the associated criteria sets were identified and all nonapplicable categories were excluded. For environmental objective climate change adaptation no economic activity was identified in the allocation of economic activities phase. As in previous years this was therefore not taken into account. Similarly no economic activity could be identified for the environmental objective sustainable use and ,0.3583080802051121,0.397006144829091,0.4531901721051217,,0.4468903727591023,,0.4219634355285869,,,,,,,0.3823204727763376,0.30635314872488634,,,0.24526768772601923,
783,protection of water and marine resources and environmental objective protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems in the classification of economic activities phase. In the Annexes to Environmental Objectives of the Delegated Regulation there were also some changes to the wording regarding compliance with the NACE codes which stipulate a stricter interpretation. While the wording a The economic activities in this category could be associated with several NACE codes is always used in environmental objectives climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation the categories in environmental objectives now often contain the wording b The economic activity relates to ... classified under the NACE codes. The wording a suggests an optional formulation so that economic activities that do not fall under the listed NACE codes but can be clearly assigned to a category on the basis of the other criteria are considered taxonomyeligible. Wording b on the other hand can be understood as a mandatory formulation meaning that economic activities that cannot be assigned to the NACE codes mentioned are considered nontaxonomyeligible. According to EU Annex I the Capital expenditure and Operating expenditure KPIs are subdivided as A directly attributable to a taxonomyeligible oraligned activity B serving to expand taxonomyeligible andaligned activities or C relating to the acquisition of production from taxonomyaligned economic activities and to individual measures through which the target activities are carried out in a lowcarbon manner or the emission of greenhouse gases is reduced. Derived from this the assignment of the category sets first identified the salesgenerating economic activities and the associated capital and operating expenditure. In addition any values that did not generate sales in the reporting period but could be assigned to categories B or C were identified. In a second step the sets of categories were applied to the economic activities of the divisions. To gain an initial estimate of the taxonomy eligibility in the expected annual values were also added. In addition these were used to determine an internal materiality limit as the granularity in the determination made possible by the EU Taxonomy Regulation in particular for C capital expenditure cannot yet be fully technically implemented. The materiality limit for comparability is based on the methodology of previous years which is approximately of the taxonomyeligible totals of sales operating expenditure and investments less special effects. Special effects are business activities that are not part of the companys core business are nonrecurring in nature and have a significant impact on earnings. These include for example the oneoff purchase of buildings by Rheinmetall Immobilien Gesellschaft for rental or resale. No significant deviations in the projected annual value were identified by the materiality limit. In the third phase the determined economic activities of Rheinmetall AG were finally checked for their taxonomy alignment. A distinction was made between requirements to be examined for each individual economic activity itself such as the substantial contribution and specific DNSH criteria requirements relating to the locations and requirements covered by Groupwide compliance. The latter particularly applies to the requirements of the minimum safeguards. For the Annexes of the Delegated Regulation on the new environmental objectives published in June and the additions to the existing annexes of environmental objectives and a soft landing will be carried out again this year so that no conformity check will be carried out and all economic activities identified here will be reported as taxonomycompliant. Due to the reclassification of economic activities in the automotive sector from category . Manufacture of other low carbon technologies to the new category . Manufacture of automotive and mobility components this leads to a oneoff significant change in the KPIs this year compared to the previous year. Due to the full reporting obligation for taxonomy eligibility and alignment for all environmental objectives taxonomy alignment is expected to increase again from the fiscal year. With the results the KPIs of the EU Taxonomy Regulation have been conclusively evaluated for the Rheinmetall Group.,0.46193963992728354,0.43770671943160966,0.47447464852773164,0.36290320732002995,0.49468861695229543,,0.4709384871102834,,,0.31617013118538606,,,,0.4360784948168111,0.4503342975904018,0.31960531399720254,,0.27118795632011033,0.36306213867798565

This involves the implementation of construction projects for residential and nonresidential buildings for the Groups own account for resale or on a fee or contract basis. For construction of new buildings comprehensive climate protection requirements must be taken into account for building permits in accordance with statutory regulations. Rheinmetall Immobilien Gesellschaft mbH is also committed to more farreaching ecological and economic measures in several projects. For example certifications in accordance with the German Sustainable Building Council DGNB which go beyond the legally required minimum requirements through strict specifications and test criteria serve as a benchmark.

807,Rheinmetall Landsysteme GmbH carries out various projects to extend the useful life of tactical vehicles. This involves completely dismantling old vehicles down to the vehicle hull and refurbishing or modernizing them. In some cases pollutants are also removed during dismantling.

For the environmental objectives to be verified not only individual activityrelated requirements but also separate appendices AD were published as part of Annex of EU and the other Annexes to Regulation EU which apply to a large number of activities and prescribe sitespecific requirements. The survey on the requirements of these annexes was prepared centrally. In this context the appendices A Generic criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation B Generic criteria for DNSH to sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources and D Generic criteria for DNSH to protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems were evaluated for the economic activities concerned and made ,0.41033769550464977,,,,0.37761987248485274,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.23653363548656414,

Appendix C Generic criteria for DNSH to pollution prevention and control regarding use and presence of chemicals required a more comprehensive consideration and interpretation. In this context the terms production placing on the market and use were defined as follows Production A harmful substance is produced for the first time in ones own company. This does not yet include an external effect. Placing on the market The harmful substance is introduced onto the market for the first time by the own company and thus has an external effect. Use A harmful substance or a product containing the harmful substance is introduced into a product by the company for the first time in production manufacturing or assembly. It should be noted that traceability over several stages of the value chain cannot currently be guaranteed. With this determination the examination of the requirements of appendix C was handed over to the divisions and examined there for each individual taxonomy asset. The result was then made available again centrally added to the package for evaluation of the DNSH criteria and thus ended the review process. ,0.30359554560993257,0.3727529942507557,0.5457480158402754,0.35048872535958103,0.528324349773,,0.4371691968427135,,,0.34069068986976236,,,,,,,,,
814,Minimum safeguards as defined in the EU Taxonomy Regulation Article are procedures implemented by an undertaking that is carrying out an economic activity to ensure the alignment with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights including the principles and rights set out in the eight fundamental conventions identified in the Declaration of the International Labour Organization on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the International Bill of Human Rights. Details of the exact requirements for minimum safeguards that companies must investigate were first published by the European Commission in July as part of a Draft Report on Minimum Safeguards and subsequently in October as part of the Final Report on Minimum Safeguards. They relate to . Human rights . Taxation . Corruption and bribery . Fair competition For each of these topics a proposal for the implementation of the criteria is explained which can be followed until the Corporate Social Responsibility Directive CSRD has been transposed into German law. For each of these topics a proposal for the implementation of the criteria is explained in a single chapter. The criteria mentioned are also presented in an overview table which formed the basis for the evaluation within the Group. A document was created to review the criteria for Rheinmetall AG in which the information in the table was adopted and responsibilities from the HR Compliance Legal and CSR departments were initially assigned for the various criteria. The type of evidence for each criterion was also noted in the document. The amendments to the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises were also taken into account in the fiscal year. Significant changes include the recommendations directed at companies to align themselves with internationally agreed objectives on climate protection and biodiversity the emphasis on corporate responsibility for the negative human rights impact of their own activities on potentially affected stakeholders and the extended protection of vulnerable groups as well as the emphasis on corporate due diligence obligations in the fight against corruption. Documents used as evidence include the annual report and the nonfinancial statement for risk analyses due diligence activities in the context of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act LkSG as well as reference documents such as the International Framework Agreement FairAll and the Code of Conduct. Furthermore since the Compliance department has been using the Ethical tool which carries out surveys on various compliance topics every two months for all Rheinmetall AG companies. Extracts from the results of these surveys were also used as evidence.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.32181291686088864,,,,
816,While recording this a distinction was made between business activities that are always associated with the intention of generating external sales and those that are not. The activities aimed at generating sales regardless of whether sales capital expenditures or operating expenditures were concerned were examined for possible doublecounting effects as there is a risk of this with regard to internal value added in particular. This approach has eliminated existing uncertainties. In the case of manufacturing overheads procedures were applied that assumed an interdependence between sales and operating costs of the respective product. It was not possible to break down the overhead costs separately. However this procedure ensured that there was no double counting. Activities that pursue a goal other than generating sales particularly energyrelated measures were analyzed on the basis of itemizations. This did not reveal any anomalies. ,,,,,,,0.40506649291644936,,,,,,,0.44669300650352767,,,,,
818,The consolidated financial statements of Rheinmetall AG have been prepared in accordance with the regulations of section e German Commercial Code HGB and the International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU. Further information on the accounting standards can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under Summary of accounting standards. In its core indicators the EU Taxonomy Regulation distinguishes between sales capital expenditure and operating expenditure.

820,Net sales comprise sales within the meaning of Article of Directive EU i.e. the amounts derived from the sale of products and the rendering of services after deducting sales allowances and value added tax and other taxes directly related to sales. Furthermore the taxonomy states that sales comprise revenue recognized in accordance with International Accounting Standard IAS paragraph a as amended by Commission Regulation EC No. . Rheinmetall records its sales in accordance with this standard so that Group sales also correspond to all taxonomy sales to be considered. ,,,,,,,0.4843064417917914,,,,,,,,,,,,
821,The sales analysis for taxonomyeligible products was carried out for all companies in the Rheinmetall Group with Electronic Solutions Vehicle Systems and Sensors and Actuators standing out. The increase in the overall total is explained by the fact that in contrast to the previous fiscal year new economic activities such as the manufacture of drones or the refurbishment of endoflife vehicles have now been included as a result of the new environmental objectives. However they are not reported as taxonomyeligible in this fiscal year beyond their taxonomyaligned status. Simulators which meet the requirements of taxonomy alignment and were already included in the previous fiscal year also account for a significant proportion this year. In the area of components for electric vehicles such as electric water pumps used to cool batteries considerable sales were again generated in the series production business this fiscal year. As in the previous fiscal year considerable taxonomyeligible sales were also generated through the production of civilian logistics and special vehicles. In the year under review further progress was made in establishing and expanding our business areas with regard to energy management and renewable energy sources. Sales were recorded in the field of brake and transmission technology for wind turbines. ,,0.34174168927565185,0.48522823133624376,0.350615280478956,,,0.4504889114918727,,,,,,0.34325002572765423,0.3696886345048314,,,,,0.3569828943288284

823,In contrast to sales capital and operating expenditures are specifically defined by the EU Taxonomy Regulation. Accordingly capital expenditure comprises all additions to property plant and equipment and intangible assets during the fiscal year before amortization depreciation and remeasurement including additions from business combinations. Leases that do not result in recognition of a right of use of the asset are excluded. For this purpose Rheinmetall has recognized the IFRS items listed in the EU Taxonomy Regulation additions to property plant and equipment intangible assets investment property and rights of use as well as the relevant transaction types such as additions to company acquisitions additions within the Group additions to government grants and external additions. ,,,0.4443874278211648,0.34493791904416327,,0.374320653824991,0.45207791253847085,0.39095655864587914,0.31360230811419976,0.34987486129251893,,0.3420458678512631,,0.39147857471573094,,,,,
825,As explained in the section on method of determination capital expenditure is broken down by origin type. The majority of taxonomyeligible capital expenditure arose from the Groups salesgenerating business activities. In particular the economic activities in category . with investments in the development of forwardlooking products such as the highvoltage water pump and the economic activities in category . with investments in products such as the innovative hydrogen recirculation blower for use in fuel cellpowered vehicles which generated investments of over million should be mentioned here. Rheinmetall Immobiliengesellschaft accounted for a further share with investments in the acquisition and construction of new buildings.

827,The denominator of operating expenditures is limited to certain expenses. Consequently the taxonomyrelevant transactions are also only a subset of this limited unit. The denominator must include direct noncapitalized expenses incurred for research and development building renovation measures shortterm leasing maintenance and repair and all other direct expenses from the maintenance of property plant and equipment to ensure operational readiness. Here too we have used standardized reporting formats and thus include maintenance costs expenses for shortterm and lowvalue leases and noncapitalized expenses for research and development. The additional determination of expenses for the daily maintenance of assets has been carried out since . Rheinmetall understands this to mean internal expenses incurred in connection with maintenance and repair by its own personnel and therefore not included in other operating expenses. When evaluating the cost centers care is taken to ensure that the total costs are adjusted for individual costs where necessary for the required data reporting in order to avoid double counting when determining the key figures. ,,0.38604118890839206,0.41387256770553965,0.42716763468978747,0.457917671163614,0.4478765979609896,0.42497712223736916,0.4315430609108879,0.3526201063601637,,,0.32727318956545554,0.35121995551416235,0.3974243611466455,,,,,0.3935186839607399

833,In the first year of collecting all data to determine taxonomyaligned economic activities a system has already been developed that sets comparable standards for all divisions.

However this initially only includes the taxonomy eligibility for environmental objectives to and the additions to the annexes for environmental objectives and . This causes a oneoff deviation in the KPIs compared to the previous year. In addition the increased denominator of investment expenditure due to the acquisition of Expal Munitions S.A.U. this year leads to a distortion of the KPIs and thus to a low comparability of this years KPIs for investment expenditure with those of the previous fiscal year.

1155,The amendments to IAS in relation to disclosure of accounting policies clarify that only material accounting policies must be explained in the notes. Material information specifically includes companyspecific information in connection with material events or transactions such as complex accounting facts the use of an accounting option or the change of accounting policies. The amendments to IAS aim to clarify the distinction between accounting changes and a change in estimates. It is stated that accounting estimates relate to monetary values in the financial statements subject to measurement uncertainty. The amendments to IAS Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction clarify that the initial recognition exemption provided in IAS does not apply to certain transactions. Accordingly the initial recognition exemption no longer applies to transactions in which equal amounts of deductible and taxable temporary differences arise on initial recognition. This amendment means that deferred tax is recognized on leases accounted for by the lessee and on decommissioning obligations. The further amendments to IAS International Tax Reform Pillar Two Model Rules comprise a temporary mandatory exception to the accounting for deferred taxes arising from the introduction of the global regulations ,,,,,,,0.4221615978733591,,,0.33442714617335983,,0.31991010938801656,,,0.35740628767465255,0.29635335354107906,,,
1157,on minimum taxation Pillar Two Model Rules. The amendments also stipulate targeted disclosures in the notes that are intended to give users of the report an understanding of the degree to which the company is affected by the implementation of the global tax regulations on minimum taxation. IFRS is the new accounting standard for insurance contracts. The new standard regulates the recognition measurement and disclosure of insurance contracts and replaces the previous regulations in accordance with IFRS Insurance Contracts. The amendments to IFRS from June provide additional clarifications to IFRS and defer the date of initial application set by IASB from January to January . The other amendments to IFRS relate to the transition requirements for entities that will first apply IFRS and IFRS at the same time. The amendments improve the requirements for the comparative information presented about financial assets at initial application. The application of the amended standards had no material effect on the presentation of the Rheinmetall Groups net assets financial position and results of operations.

1162,The amendments to IAS Classification of Liabilities as Current or NonCurrent specify the regulation on classifying liabilities as current or noncurrent in cases of uncertainty as to the settlement amount. In particular they clarify that classification is aligned to the rights the company has at the end of the reporting period. The IASB has deferred the effective date to January . The further amendments to IAS Noncurrent Liabilities with Covenants relate to classifications of liabilities as current or noncurrent for which certain covenants have been agreed. With the amendments issued the IASB clarifies that only covenants with which an entity is required to comply on or before the reporting date affect the classification of a liability as current or noncurrent. In addition the amendments specify additional disclosure requirements for noncurrent liabilities with covenants. The amendments to IFRS contain unifying provisions for how a sellerlessee subsequently measures sale and leaseback transactions. They require a sellerlessee to subsequently measure lease liabilities arising from a sale and leaseback in a way that it does not recognize any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use it retains. The subsequent measurement of lease liabilities in connection with a sale and leaseback must include the expected payments at the commencement date. In each period the lease liability is reduced by the expected payments and the difference compared with the actual payments is recognized through profit or loss. The following amendments have not yet been implemented in European law as they are not yet endorsed The amendments to IAS supplement the disclosure regulations in connection with supplier finance arrangements reverse factoring arrangements.

1163,part of such arrangements companies must also disclose the portion of these liabilities for which the suppliers have already received payments and the items of the statement of financial position under which these liabilities are reported. Furthermore disclosures must be made with regard to the ranges of the payment terms for these financial liabilities and for comparable trade payables that do not form part of such finance arrangements with suppliers. As a result of the amendments to IFRS information on liquidity risk must also be provided for supplier finance arrangements. The amendments to IAS establish regulations that can be used to determine whether two currencies are exchangeable with one another and how the exchange rates are to be determined if a currency is not exchangeable. A currency is considered to be exchangeable if a company can exchange this currency into another at the measurement date on markets or using exchange mechanisms. If a company can only obtain an immaterial amount of the other currency then a currency is not exchangeable into another currency. In this case the closing rate is estimated by the company. This is to be done using the rate that would have applied to a properly executed transaction between market participants and which would reflect the prevailing economic conditions. The application of the new and amended standards and interpretations is not expected to have a material effect on the presentation of the Rheinmetall Groups net assets financial position and results of operations. ,,,0.3896527067171304,,,,0.5038646316579393,,,0.32965591888372175,,,,,,0.27192594836658,,,
1165,The key accounting policies and measurement principles applied to Rheinmetall AGs consolidated financial statements are described below. Cost Cost includes the purchase price and all incidental costs that can be directly with the exception of company acquisitions as defined by IFRS and financial instruments measured at fair value attributed to the purchase. In the event of an exchange cost equals the fair value of the asset given in an exchange of assets transaction as of the date of the exchange whereby any cash compensation is accounted for accordingly. Cost includes all expenditures that are directly attributable to the production process and an appropriate share of productionrelated overheads. The latter comprise material and production overheads including productionrelated depreciation and social security expenses as well as pro rata administrative costs. Overheads are allocated to production costs on the basis of the production facilities normal capacity utilization. Financing costs are capitalized as costs if they relate to assets which are produced or purchased over a period exceeding one year. Grants and allowances Government grants provided for the acquisition of an asset are deducted from the corresponding capital expenditures. Any government grants for expenses for purposes other than investment activities are recognized as deferred income and amortized to profit via other operating income when the related expenses are incurred. Private investmentrelated grants from customers are also recognized as deferred income and amortized to profit over the contract term. If economic ownership of the subsidized asset is transferred to the customer sales are recognized on the date of the transfer. Impairment If there are indications of impairment on an asset or a cashgenerating unit CGU and the recoverable amount is less than the amortized cost an impairment loss is recognized. If indications for impairment cease to exist impairment losses are reversed with the exception of goodwill. The reversal cannot exceed the value of amortized cost that would have resulted if no impairment had been charged. Goodwill Goodwill in the amount of the potential benefit is allocated to the cashgenerating units at the level of which management monitors goodwill. It is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment once a year at the end of the reporting period and during the year if there are indications of impairment. The impairment test compares the carrying amount to the recoverable amount. Fair value less costs to sell determined applying the discounted cash flow method based on the current corporate planning is used as the recoverable amount. If this value is below the carrying amount a check is made as to whether the value in use results in a higher recoverable amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount impairment is recognized down to the recoverable amount which is reported as a writedown. The subsequent reversal of writedowns is not permitted. ,,,0.4198425620790828,,0.36099176797691734,0.3430288810186234,0.41889314762504365,,,0.3229532469811689,,,,,,,,,
1166,Other intangible assets Intangible assets are capitalized at cost. Research costs are always recognized in expenses. Development costs are only capitalized if a newly developed product or process can be clearly defined is technically feasible and is intended either for own use or marketing purposes. Furthermore capitalization requires that the costs can be reliably measured and there is reasonable assurance of a future economic benefit. Any other development costs are immediately expensed. Finitelived intangible assets are amortized from the date of first use over the economic lives.

1172,Leases Agreements that transfer the right to use assets for a specified period of time in return for payment or a series of payments are leases. Rheinmetall as the lessee recognizes a financial liability in the amount of the present value of the lease payments to be made over the term of the lease. The calculation of present value accounts for fixed lease payments variable indexbased payments expected payments for residual value guarantees exercise prices of call options if their exercise is reasonably assured and payments from the early termination of the lease less any rental incentives. The calculated lease payments are discounted at the date of commencement of the lease by the appropriate incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease term. The lease liability is reduced by the repayment portion of the lease payment until the lease expires. At the same time Rheinmetall as lessee recognizes a rightofuse asset equal to the cost at the date of commencement of the lease. Starting at the value of the lease liability the cost is increased in some circumstances by initial direct costs dismantling costs and lease payments that are made by the lessee before or at the commencement of the transfer of use and therefore not included in the lease liability. The rightofuse assets are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the leases and the useful life of the relevant leased asset. In the case of leases with a term of less than one year lease payments are recognized directly in other operating expenses. The same applies to leases for lowvalue assets whose value is less than thousand and which are not land buildings or vehicles. Investment property Investment property is property held to earn rental income or to benefit from longterm capital appreciation and not for use in production or administration. ,0.287001593497298,,,0.3689245765600667,0.36683449057228357,0.3794897891529175,,0.36601367218498393,0.32487829897887155,,,0.49696692386891966,,,,,,,
1173,Investment property is carried at cost less cumulative depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is recognized on a straightline basis over a useful life of to years. Financial instruments The firsttime recognition of financial instruments is at fair value. In the case of a financial asset that is not measured at fair value through profit or loss incidental costs are included on firsttime recognition. Standard market purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized for the first time on the settlement date. This is the date when the financial instrument is delivered or the payment is made. Notwithstanding this derivatives are recognized for the first time as of the date when the contract is concluded or the trading date. There are three measurement categories for the subsequent measurement of financial instruments measurement at amortized cost measurement at fair value through other comprehensive income FVOCI and measurement at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL. The relevant measurement category for a financial instrument depends on the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset and the entitys business model for managing financial assets. If the contractual cash flows comprise solely payments of principal and interest SPPI and the business model is hold financial instruments are measured at amortized cost. Financial instruments with SPPI cash flows but the hold and sell business model are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. If the SPPI criterion is not met the financial instruments are likewise measured at fair value but the changes in value are recognized through profit or loss. In the case of debt instruments changes in value can be recognized through profit or loss despite fulfillment of the SPPI criterion by exercising the fair value option. Currently there are no situations in which the fair value option is used for debt instruments. In the case of equity instruments the fair value OCI option provides the opportunity to recognize any changes in value that arise through other comprehensive income. Trade receivables and liquid financial assets are generally measured at amortized cost. Trade receivables classified by Group companies as available for sale must be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Other financial assets measured at amortized cost are discounted by applying rates that match their maturity on firsttime recognition and written down using the effective interest method. As of the end of the reporting period the default risk of financial assets is checked and if necessary an impairment recognized on the basis of expected losses. For trade receivables the simplified method is used applying the customer credit rating and specific country risks. The loss allowance for expected default risks is recognized in the income statement. Cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortized cost. Cash and cash equivalents comprise any liquid assets with a remaining term of less than three months at the date of their purchase. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized in the income statement. If the conditions under IFRS are met they are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the designated derivative is recognized in equity in the hedge reserve. The cumulative changes in fair value are reclassified from equity to the income statement if the hedged item is recognized in the income statement. Changes in the fair value attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedge are always recognized in the income statement. Financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Compound financial instruments Rheinmetall has issued a compound financial instrument in the form of a convertible bond. Provided certain criteria are met the convertible bond grants the holder the right to convert it into a certain number of shares. On initial recognition the liability component of the compound financial instrument is recognized at the fair value of a similar bond without a conversion right. The equity component is recognized in the amount of the difference between the fair value of the total compound financial instrument and the fair value of the liability component. Directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the debt and equity components in the ratio of their carrying amounts on initial recognition. ,,,,0.332690157036429,0.35808530677680434,,0.40116023355825065,0.35696484383271776,,,0.4928144924724355,0.3643215242743055,,,,,,,
1174,The liability component is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. By contrast the equity component remains unchanged during the term of the compound financial instrument. When exercising the conversion right at the end of the term the liability component is transferred to equity without any effect on profit or loss. The interest incurred in connection with the compound financial instrument is recognized through profit or loss. Inventories Inventories are carried at cost usually using the weighted average. Inherent risks due to reduced utility or to obsolescence are adequately allowed for. If the net realizable value of inventories is lower than their carrying amount as of the end of the reporting period they are written down to net realizable value. The writedown is recognized either as cost of materials raw materials and supplies or a change in inventories of finished products and work in progress. If the net realizable value of inventories previously written down increases the ensuing reversal is routinely offset against cost of materials raw materials and supplies or recognized as a change in inventories of finished products and work in progress. Assets held for sale and associated liabilities in discontinued operations A discontinued operation is a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that either is held for sale or has already been sold and is clearly distinct from the entitys other operations both from a business perspective and for the purposes of financial reporting. A discontinued operation classified as held for sale in accordance with the criteria of IFRS is recognized in the consolidated financial statements under discontinued operations. At the reclassification date the discontinued operation is stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Depreciation and amortization are suspended from the reclassification date. Assets and liabilities that are not within the scope of the measurement requirements of IFRS are measured in accordance with the standards applicable to them. The elimination entries for transactions between continuing and discontinued operations are assigned in full to discontinued operations. In reporting the activities of the discontinued operation are not assigned to a reportable segment. Assets and liabilities of discontinued operations are reclassified to the assets held for sale and liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale items in the statement of financial position. The previous years statement of financial position items are not reclassified. In the income statement the earnings after taxes of the discontinued operations are combined in a separate item as Earnings from discontinued operations. The previous years figures in the income statement are restated accordingly. The statement of cash flows continues to comprise the cash flows of the entire Group and is supplemented by an of which item for the net cash flows of discontinued operations. Contract assets and contract liabilities Contract assets are recognized in connection with contracts with customers if in the case of contract manufacturing the cumulative sales recognized over time exceed the sum of the advance payments received and progress billings. As of the end of the reporting period this asset item is tested for impairment and if necessary an impairment is recognized on the basis of expected losses. If the recognized sales are lower than the sum of the advance payments received and progress billings a contract liability is recognized. A contract liability is also recognized if advance payments are received and consideration has not yet been provided. Deferred taxes Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary measurement differences between items shown in the statement of financial position under IFRS and according to the local tax laws of the individual companies. Deferred tax assets also include the tax assets receivable from the expected future utilization of tax loss carryforwards if their realization is reasonably certain. Deferred taxes are calculated on the basis of the tax rates applicable or announced in each country as of the end of the reporting period. Income tax liabilities are recognized on the basis of appropriate estimates for obligations to the respective national tax authorities that are uncertain in terms of amount and probability of occurrence. The tax rate specific to the company effective at the end of the reporting period is used. Other factors are also taken into account such as experience from previous external audits and different legal interpretations between taxpayers and the tax authorities with regard to the issue at hand. Uncertain income tax items are recognized at the most likely amount. ,,,,,0.4158851906206107,,0.47779533734291546,,,0.3059425836755056,0.43250979367976417,0.3224306069292322,,0.37899214867129627,,,,,0.36074756189771817
1175,Sharebased payments Sharebased payments are recognized in line with IFRS Sharebased payment. There is a longterm incentive remuneration program LTI for the managers of the Rheinmetall Group in order to involve management in the companys longterm development. Under this program the beneficiaries are paid performancerelated remuneration for the past fiscal year in the subsequent year. The remuneration comprises a cash component and a component settled in shares. This remuneration program existed for the Executive Board until the end of fiscal . Since fiscal the Executive Board members have been granted virtual shares as part of the longterm incentive program hereinafter LTI .. On the basis of an individual target amount at the allocation date the beneficiaries are promised a special payment at the end of the term which depends among other things on the share price performance of Rheinmetall AG. The remuneration cost is recognized through profit or loss until the vesting date. Please refer to the remuneration report for further information. Since fiscal employees of participating Group companies have had the option to purchase Rheinmetall shares at reduced prices. The reduction constitutes an equitysettled sharebased payment transaction for services or work provided. The payments thus fall within the scope of IFRS and are recognized in personnel expenses. Pensions Pension provisions for defined benefit plan obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method. The amount of obligations is calculated based on assumptions concerning mortality expected future pay and pension increases plan participant turnover rates the discount rate and other actuarial parameters. The fair value of the plan assets is deducted from the DBO volume. Any excess of plan assets over the DBO volume a defined benefit asset is only recognized if and to the extent that it can actually be utilized. If there are deviations between the actuarial assumptions and the actual development of underlying parameters used to calculate the projected unit credits of the pension assets gains and losses arise from remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability. These effects arising from remeasurement and the asset cap are recognized directly in equity under retained earnings in the year they occur. Under defined contribution plans the company incurs no obligations other than to pay the contributions to earmarked postemployment benefit plans. The payments incurred are recognized in personnel expenses. The Rheinmetall Group also participates in multiemployer pension plans. As these are defined benefit plans they are accounted for accordingly. Provisions Other provisions take into account all identifiable commitments and obligations to third parties if based on past transactions or events and if it is probable that an outflow of resources which can be reliably estimated embodying economic benefits results. If the time value of money is material provisions are discounted to their settlement amount as of the end of the reporting period. The settlement amount also accounts for identifiable future cost increases. Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized when the promised goods or services are transferred to the customer and the customer obtains control over them. Revenue is measured at the transaction price that is expected to be received as consideration. The transaction price is lowered by variable consideration e.g. rebates bonuses and penalties for late deliveries or increased by agreed and estimated price adjustments. If especially in the case of longerterm contracts with customers the revenue is recognized and the payments are received at different times the contract is examined to determine whether it contains a significant financing component which must be accounted for in the calculation of the transaction price. If a contract with a customer relates to contract manufacturing in which customerspecific products including a significant integration service are provided the revenue is recognized over time. The revenue to be recognized is determined by the percentage of completion of the respective contract. This is calculated as the ratio of costs actually incurred to the estimated total costs. The costs associated with the customer contract are recognized in the income statement when incurred.

1184,Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires assumptions and estimates affecting the application of accounting principles within the Group and the disclosure of assets liabilities income and expenses. When examining the recognition of goodwill of million as of December previous year million assumptions and estimates relating to forecasts and the discounting of future cash flows were made to calculate the recoverable amount of the relevant cashgenerating units. Details of the parameters used are provided under note . The carrying amounts of other intangible assets of million previous year million rightofuse assets of million previous year million property plant and equipment of million previous year million and investment property of million previous year million are assessed as of December to determine whether there are indications of a possible impairment and whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount. When calculating the recoverable amounts assumptions and estimates are made on the cash flows from realizable sales prices costs and the discount rates. The yield curves used in the measurement of derivatives include assumptions about the expected future development of interest rates taking into account estimated liquidity risks dependent on terms. Moreover the measurement models used also incorporate parameters that are based on assumptions about volatilities and discount rates. At the end of the reporting period discontinued operations are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The measurement of fair value less costs to sell is based on assumptions and estimates and takes valuerelevant information from the ongoing selling process into account. As of December the net carrying amount of discontinued operations was million previous year million. ,,,,,0.37725180825280846,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1190,Subsidiaries Besides Rheinmetall AG the consolidated financial statements include all German and foreign subsidiaries over which Rheinmetall AG can directly or indirectly exercise a controlling influence. Rheinmetall AG controls an entity if it holds the majority of voting rights or other rights and is therefore able to steer the significant activities of the investee is exposed to the risk of variable returns from the investment and can use its power over the investee to influence its returns. Receivables and payables expenses and income and intercompany profitslosses among consolidated companies are eliminated. Taxes are deferred for all temporary differences from the consolidation of receivablespayables incomeexpenses and the elimination of intercompany profitslosses. A subsidiary is included in consolidation for the first time in accordance with the acquisition method. The assets and liabilities acquired are carried at fair value at the time of acquisition. Any positive difference between the purchase cost and the pro rata net assets of the acquired company is reported as goodwill under intangible assets. Any badwill is recognized in other operating income. The cost of the acquired subsidiary equals the fair values of the assets given liabilities assumed and equity instruments issued by the acquirer in exchange for the acquisition. Any acquisitionrelated costs incurred are recognized as other operating expenses. Joint ventures and associates Jointly controlled entities in which Rheinmetall has rights to the net assets of the investee joint ventures are included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method. Entities over which Rheinmetall can exert significant influence associates are also recognized using the equity method. On firsttime inclusion based on the cost at the time the investment interest is acquired the respective investment carrying amount is increased or decreased by changes in equity of the joint venture or associate to the extent these can be attributed to equity interest of the Rheinmetall Group. Goodwill for these investments is calculated in line with the principles applying to full consolidation. Any resulting goodwill is included in the investment carrying amount. If there are intercompany profits from transactions between the Rheinmetall Group and the joint venture or associate these are eliminated on a pro rata basis. Joint operations In joint operations the jointly controlling parties have rights to the assets and liabilities of the joint arrangement.

1205,The Rheinmetall Group updated the purchase price allocation in the fourth quarter of in particular in light of the prevailing market conditions. The valuation techniques used to value intangible assets were specified to ensure a more appropriate determination of fair value. Furthermore the parameters on which the valuation was based were adjusted to reflect the updated estimates. In particular the adjusted purchase price allocation led to an increase in intangible assets amounting to million. In addition the final purchase price adjustment agreed at the start of fiscal was already taken into account. Various assessment procedures were used to determine the fair value of the material assets acquired Intangible assets determined in particular with the help of the residual value method but also using the relieffromroyalty method. The residual value method takes into account the present value of the net cash flows generated by the intangible asset to be assessed. As intangible assets often only generate cash flows in combination with other assets the relevant cash surpluses are adjusted to take cash flows resulting from the supporting assets into account. When the relieffromroyalty method is applied the fair value is calculated as the present value of the anticipated savings in license payments. Property plant and equipment determined based on market comparison methods and cost methods. Where available market prices for similar assets and if necessary amortized replacement costs that reflect adjustments for physical deterioration functional or economic obsolescence are used. Inventories determined using market comparison methods. With these methods the fair value is determined based on an estimated sales price under normal business conditions less the expected completion and selling costs and appropriate profit margins. The goodwill of million resulting from the acquisition is justified by the strong market position and high profitability of Expal Systems S.A.U. and the synergy effects that are expected to be generated as a result of the acquisition. The goodwill which is not taxdeductible was allocated to Weapon and Ammunition. ,,,,,,0.33040428026297014,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1297,technology planning is predicated on projects already included in its order backlog on customer inquiries and most importantly on national defence budgets of relevant customers. Key planning assumptions in the area of the automotive industry are based on the sector forecasts underlying sales plans and covering the worldwide automotive market trend the planned engine programs of carmakers specific customer commitments to individual projects and adjustments specific to Automotive to allow for planned product innovations and cost savings. For periods after the detailed planning phase cash flows are extrapolated from the last planning period taking into account growth rates based on longterm business expectations which are guided by the longterm inflation forecast. The measurement of fair value less costs to sell is therefore primarily based on unobservable inputs and allocated to level of the fair value hierarchy.

1332,The schedule for the disposal of the shares in the associate Shriram Pistons Rings Ltd. India was amended in fiscal . As a result the shares in this investment accounted for using the equity method are no longer part of the discontinued business unit see the information under note Discontinued operations. In accordance with the requirements of IAS a retrospective atequity valuation of the investment was therefore calculated from the time of its initial classification as held for sale. The opening carrying amounts in equity affected as of January the carrying amounts as of December and the previous years values in the income statement were restated accordingly. The effects associated with the atequity valuation extrapolation are included in the result from continued operations. Prior to its retrospective application the atequity valuation extrapolation was suspended in accordance with IFRS . As the retrospective adjustment did not have any material impact on the comparative period from the Rheinmetall Group perspective a third statement of financial position as of January was not presented. The sale of several share packages caused the interest held by Rheinmetall in Shriram Pistons Rings Ltd. to fall from more than to . by the end of fiscal . Furthermore Rheinmetalls codetermination options on the Board of Directors of Shriram Pistons Rings Ltd. were restricted by a contractual agreement entered into in conjunction with the sale of the smallbore pistons business see the relevant information under note Discontinued operations. Consequently the Rheinmetall Group no longer assumes that it can exercise significant influence over Shriram Pistons Rings Ltd. and therefore no longer accounts for the investment as an associate as of December but rather as a financial instrument measured at fair value. The carrying amount of the investment in Shriram Pistons Rings Ltd. and the amounts recognized for this investment in other comprehensive income were therefore derecognized following this change in status. The profit amounting to million from the sale of the share packages is included in the income from investments accounted for using the equity method. The same applies to the initial assessment of securities at fair value million. However the impact of the subsequent measurement at fair value of the shares still held by Rheinmetall as of December of million is recognized in other net financial income. After taking into account the impact of the atequity valuation of million to be recognized for Shriram Pistons Rings Ltd. and the dividend received of million the total impact on earnings before taxes in connection with Shriram Pistons Rings Ltd. amounts to million in fiscal . ,,,,,,0.3524418497734992,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1381,benefits from the pension fund provided for in accordance with the pension plan are also covered by an insurance policy. The acquisition of the shares in Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land Ltd. requires Rheinmetall to make payments to the BAE Groups pension fund for the entitlements earned by the acquired employees. It is not possible to withdraw from the pension fund. If the recognized pension obligations of Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land Ltd. that are not covered by plan assets Rheinmetall a claim to reimbursement from the BAE Group in the same amount see note Other Assets which compensates for the remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability from pensions. In addition the BAE Group is obliged to make the ongoing pension payments to retirees. Excess or deficient cover of the pension fund and its performance are therefore neutral in terms of earnings and risk. By acquiring the shares Rheinmetall took on full joint liability for the BAE Groups pension agreements. The occurrence of a liability claim is considered to be highly unlikely.

In conjunction with negotiations with potential buyers of the smallbore pistons business at this time it became apparent that contrary to the original goal the disposal of smallbore pistons business would only be possible if the pension obligations due to retirees were excluded. This was confirmed with the signing of the contract for the sale of the smallbore pistons business see the information under note Discontinued operations. The pension obligations due to these pensioners amount to million as of December . The changes in financial assumptions and the experience adjustments in the actuarial losses arose across all companies. The actuarial losses from the change in financial assumptions in fiscal essentially result from lower discount rates. At the Swiss companies the value of the plan assets exceeds the present value of the DBO. As of December excess cover of the present value of the DBO due to an asset ceiling results in a partial asset ceiling previous year full asset ceiling. As a result a net defined benefit from plan assets is reported under other noncurrent nonfinancial receivables as of December see note Other Assets previous year no net asset recognized. This development is due to the lower yield curve compared to the previous year and the associated expectation of being able to reduce contributory payments in the future. In the United Kingdom the asset ceiling again resulted in a full asset ceiling as it did in the previous year. As Rheinmetall has no claim to reimbursements from the excess cover of the pension plans in the United Kingdom and the future contributions to the plans must not be reduced as a result of the excess cover the asset value must be limited. The service cost and the balance of entryleaving benefits are reported under personnel expenses. The interest expense and interest income from pensions are netted in net interest income. Employers and employees made total payments of million to plan assets previous year million. million previous year million of this relates to the allocation to CTA assets for pension obligations in Germany.

1456,With trade receivables measured at amortized cost the carrying amount approximates the fair value. The market value of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value is determined on the basis of input factors observed directly or indirectly on the market level . The foreign exchange rates applicable at the end of the reporting period and the yield curves are key inputs in calculating the fair value of derivatives for currency hedges. The discounted cash flow method is used for currency swaps and currency forwards. The fair value of the commodity futures is derived from the market price as of the measurement date. Fund units held for trading were measured at the market value for each asset class until the reversal of the investment. The other financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss include the shares in Shriram Pistons Rings Ltd. As these are traded on the Indian stock exchange the input factors can be directly observed on the market Level . Please refer to the information under note Other Assets. The net result from financial assets and liabilities allocated to the category at fair value through profit or loss amounted to income of million previous year loss of million. For financial assets and liabilities not allocated to a measurement category in accordance with IFRS this resulted in income of million previous year income of million.

1465,The items relate to financial instruments measured at amortized cost. Financial risks The operations and financing transactions of the Rheinmetall Group as an international group are exposed to financial market risks mainly from liquidity counterparty default electricity gas and commodity prices exchange rate volatility and interest rate changes. In accordance with the Groupwide risk management system of Rheinmetall AG such risks are not only identified analyzed and measured but also managed by taking actions to avoid contain or limit such risks. Inherent financial risks are actively managed to ensure that no significant risks arise from financial instruments as of the end of the reporting period. Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are used to reduce currency and commodity price risks. If the value changes of the hedged item and the hedging instrument are not recognized in profit and loss at the same time and the necessary conditions are met changes in the fair value of hedging transactions are recognized in the hedge reserve in the context of cash flow hedge accounting. The effectiveness of these transactions is subject to ongoing monitoring using the critical terms match method prospectively. Ineffective portions to be recognized are determined using the dollar offset testing method. The table below shows the fair value of all hedges accounted for as financial assets or financial liabilities as of the end of the reporting period. ,0.28183150002505686,,,0.3609009863678331,,,,,,,0.45102332227817377,,,,,,,,

1476,Default risk expected credit risk The default risk from financial assets is that the other contractual party does not fulfill its obligations. The maximum risk is the carrying amount recognized. In order to minimize the default risk with derivative financial instrument contracts the Rheinmetall Group sets high requirements in respect of its counterparties restricting itself exclusively to banks with impeccable ratings. The Rheinmetall Group monitors and tracks the default risk on customer receivables at the level of its operating units in line with the corporate policies for proper debtor management. Individual assessments where appropriate based on current trends and qualitative information can be used in addition to databasesupported rating and default data of an external data supplier. Current del credere risks are covered by valuation allowances. There are no significant valuation allowances for customer receivables at the Rheinmetall Group. Given the type of business and the customer structure default rarely occurs and instead there are only delays in payment. There were no other material impairments not recognized on the basis of collateral. In addition potential default risks are assessed on an individual basis in connection with longterm orders and reduced or hedged by means of prepayments credit insurance guarantees or letters of credit. The risk provision for general default risk calculated according to the simplified approach for the measurement of trade receivables amounted to million in previous year million. million of this relates to receivables more than days past due previous year million. The risk calculated using business modelspecific default rates for receivables up to days past due is less than . previous year less than .. As of the end of the reporting period there were no indications that the debtors of any receivables past due will fail to make payment. Because of the customer structure the risk does not significantly increase even when the receivables are a long time past due. ,,,,,,,0.4009288655523932,,,,,,,,,,,,

1558,aIn the consolidated financial statements of the Company as at December an amount of million is recognized as revenue in the statement of profit or loss of which million was recognized according to the percentage of completion method. A material part of the activities in the business with security technology is realized under longterm customerspecific agreements. The balance sheet as at December shows contract assets and contract liabilities of million and million respectively. Revenue from longterm customerspecific agreements is generally recognized over the period in which the relevant asset was created unless the Rheinmetall Group has an alternative possibility to use the asset and is legally entitled to receive payment for the services already rendered. Also if an asset is created or enhanced and the customer gains control over the asset as the asset is created or enhanced revenue is recognized over a period of time. When recognizing revenue over a period of time revenue is recognized according to the percentage of completion which is calculated as the ratio of the actually incurred contract cost to the estimated total cost to complete the contract. From our point of view recognizing revenue over a period of time is subject to a considerable risk of material misstatements due to fraud or error and is therefore of particular importance in the context of our audit. Estimates by the management have a significant impact on the determination of the percentage of completion the expected total cost and the cost of orders that is still to be incurred until completion including any contract risks and their probability of occurrence. Due to new evidence obtained on the cost development and changes in the ordered project scope over the multiyear terms of the contracts and the rendering of the services revenue estimated contract cost and completion of the contract may sometimes deviate considerably from the original project calculation. ,,,,0.3282300322419204,,0.3924295693541333,,,,,,,0.35733538935250975,,,,,,0.34828618331306826
1559,For information provided by the executive board on revenue recognition please refer to the sections Accounting policies and Sales in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. bDuring our audit we consulted the parts of the underlying contracts relevant to accounting and evaluated the process of proper identification of the performance obligation and classification of satisfying the performance obligation over a given period of time. For the purpose of risk assessment we obtained an overview of the business development in the reporting year and assessed to what extent the revenue recognition could be influenced by subjectivity complexity or other inherent risk factors. Based on the understanding we have obtained of the processes we evaluated the design of identified internal controls relevant to the audit and ascertained whether they had been established. We focused our audit of these control procedures on the controls for approval of the project valuation taking into account the percentage of completion and the projected project margin. To the extent that we relied on identified controls we also assessed the effectiveness of those controls. We evaluated the appropriateness of the project calculation and the assessment of the percentage of completion by means of longterm customerspecific agreements that were selected based on riskbased aspects. The key criteria for the selection of our project spot checks were the amount of the total contract value and of the contract volume the revenue realized with the project in the year under review as well as the development of the project margin or its amount in the year under review. In addition some contracts were randomly selected on a sample basis. Besides gaining an understanding of the underlying parts of the contract our audit procedures included inquiries of the project management the division management and the executive board into the development of the projects the current evaluation of the expected cost still to be incurred until completion as well as the estimate of the probability of occurrence of contract risks and opportunities. Moreover we reconstructed the proper recognition and netting of direct cost as well as the amount and netting of overheads. In the case of estimates made by the management we assessed the reasonableness of the methods applied the assumptions made and the data used. In addition we audited the completeness and correctness of the corresponding disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. ,,,,,,0.4531715935170744,,,,,,0.29202263536286566,,,,,,,
