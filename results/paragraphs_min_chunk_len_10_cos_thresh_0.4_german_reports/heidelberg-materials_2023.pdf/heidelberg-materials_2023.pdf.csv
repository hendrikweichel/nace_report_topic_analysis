At our quarries and aggregates pits we are committed to environmentally friendly quarrying methods as well as to the subsequent restoration and recultivation of quarrying sites.What we do The extraction of raw materials such as limestone sand and gravel has an impact on nature and ecosystems. However quarries and aggregates pits in intensively cultivated landscapes worldwide can also contribute to the conservation of habitats and biodiversity and are refuges for rare animal and plant species. We want to reduce neutralise or even overcompensate the impacts of our activities. We work to conserve habitats and species throughout the life cycle of our quarries.Our aim is to be nature positive and to set aside of the land at all of our active ,,0.4814867851065035,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1754,Active waste management and the associated reduction of environmental pollution are two core objectives of a circular economy. Our main focus in waste management is on minimising production waste and reusing byproducts from the production process in expedient ways. For example kiln dust that is a byproduct of clinker production is generally reused as an alternative raw material in the production of certain types of cement. This dust has to be removed from the kiln systems at several facilities in order to prevent disruptions to proper kiln operations. In some exceptional cases the locally produced cement type portfolio prevents us from fully recycling the dust. A second possibility for us is to use the kiln dust as a raw material for the produc,,,0.46148338904997566,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The emissions associated with the own transport fleet have in the past been included in the Scope up and downstream categories. As they are treated differently from the fuel and processrelated emissions and audited only with limited assurance they are reported separately.	 The calculation methodology was adjusted in and relates only to the cement and readymixed concrete business lines. For the cement business externally purchased mineral components cement and clinker are considered for readymixed concrete the emissions contained in the purchased cement. The additives in readymixed concrete previously recorded are excluded. Previous years data was adjusted retroactively. Due to the change in the baseline for emissions from purchased clinker and cement we will have our SBTi target reviewed.	 Includes the consumption of the cement and aggregates business lines. Compared to previous years the supply chain emissions Welltotank for electricity as well as the associated transmission  distribution losses have been included. Moreover the fuelrelated transport emissions have been included in for the first time and had been included in the overall up and downstream transport emissions in the prior year. A recalculation of the previous years figures is not possible.
