1697,resource conservation in the supply chainthe supply chain also plays an important role in efforts to conserve resources.  the mercedesbenz group wants to decouple resource consumption from economic growth.  to achieve this goal it is relying on the support of its suppliers.  with their help the group wants to continuously increase the proportion of secondary and renewable materials in its vehicles.  plastics steel and aluminium have been identified as particularly important such materials in mercedesbenz vehicles,,,0.4701012165236051,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1704,the cornerstones of this approach involve the use of recyclates and lightweight materials as well as recyclability.  mercedesbenz group requirement specifications already define a minimum proportion of recycled material for each component in new mercedesbenz cars.  this proportion varies depending on the vehicle model and series in question.  as part of its sustainable business strategy the mercedesbenz group also relies on the use of natural fibres and textiles as a means of replacing conventional plastics with renewable raw materials. steel the use of secondary materials such as steel scrap can reduce primary resource requirements in line with a circular economy,,,0.4893021734936702,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1708,steel the use of secondary materials such as steel scrap can reduce primary resource requirements in line with a circular economy.  for example mercedesbenz ag and its partner therefore ensure the recycling of scrap steel from the mercedesbenz cars plant in sindelfingen germany. aluminium mercedesbenz cars and mercedesbenz vans already use recycled materials including recycled aluminium in numerous seriesproduction vehicles.  aluminium is a light metal that can be recycled without any loss of quality and the recycling process for aluminium uses less energy than would be required to produce new aluminium.  in order to continue increasing its use of recycled materials mercedesbenz ag is working with its suppliers to develop aluminium alloys with high endoflife scrap potential from old vehicles or packaging for example,,,0.45875325661622285,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
