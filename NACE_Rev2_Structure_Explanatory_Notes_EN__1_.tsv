These operations are often accomplished by the units that extracted the resource and/or others located nearby.\n\nMining activities are classified into divisions, groups and classes on the basis of the principal mineral produced. Divisions 05, 06 are concerned with mining and quarrying of fossil fuels (coal, lignite, petroleum, gas); divisions 07, 08 concern metal ores, various minerals and quarry products. \n\nSome of the technical operations of this section, particularly related to the extraction of hydrocarbons, may also be carried out for third parties by specialised units as an industrial service which is reflected in division 09."

"3220"	"C"	"C"	"MANUFACTURING"		"1"	"This section includes the physical or chemical transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products, although this cannot be used as the single universal criterion for defining manufacturing (see remark on processing of waste below). The materials, substances, or components transformed are raw materials that are products of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining or quarrying as well as products of other manufacturing activities. Substantial alteration, renovation or reconstruction of goods is generally considered to be manufacturing.\n\nThe output of a manufacturing process may be finished in the sense that it is ready for utilisation or consumption, or it may be semi-finished in the sense that it is to become an input for further manufacturing. For example, the output of alumina refining is the input used in the primary production of aluminium; primary aluminium is the input to aluminium wire drawing; and aluminium wire is the input for the manufacture of fabricated wire products.\n\nManufacture of specialised components and parts of, and accessories and attachments to, machinery and equipment is, as a general rule, classified in the same class as the manufacture of the machinery and equipment for which the parts and accessories are intended. Manufacture of unspecialised components and parts of machinery and equipment, e.g. engines, pistons, electric motors, electrical assemblies, valves, gears, roller bearings, is classified in the appropriate class of manufacturing, without regard to the machinery and equipment in which these items may be included. However, making specialised components and accessories by moulding or extruding plastics materials is included in group 22.2.\n\nAssembly of the component parts of manufactured products is considered manufacturing. This includes the assembly of manufactured products from either self-produced or purchased components. \n\nThe recovery of waste, i.e. the processing of waste into secondary raw materials is classified in group 38.3 (Materials recovery). While this may involve physical or chemical transformations, this is not considered to be a part of manufacturing. The primary purpose of these activities is considered to be the treatment or processing of waste and they are therefore classified in Section E (Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities). However, the manufacture of new final products (as opposed to secondary raw materials) is classified in manufacturing, even if these processes use waste as an input. For example, the production of silver from film waste is considered to be a manufacturing process.\n\nSpecialised maintenance and repair of industrial, commercial and similar machinery and equipment is, in general, classified in division 33 (Repair, maintenance and installation of machinery and equipment). However, the repair of computers and personal and household goods is classified in division 95 (Repair of computers and personal and household goods), while the repair of motor vehicles is classified in division 45 (Wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles). \n\nThe installation of machinery and equipment, when carried out as a specialised activity, is classified in 33.20. \n\nRemark: The boundaries of manufacturing and the other sectors of the classification system can be somewhat blurry. As a general rule, the activities in the manufacturing section involve the transformation of materials into new products. Their output is a new product. However, the definition of what constitutes a new product can be somewhat subjective. As clarification, the following activities are considered manufacturing in NACE:\n- fresh fish processing (oyster shucking, fish filleting), not done on a fishing boat (see 10.20)\n- milk pasteurising and bottling (see 10.51)\n- leather converting (see 15.11)\n- wood preserving (see 16.10)\n- printing and related activities (see 18.1)\n- tyre retreading (see 22.11)\n- ready-mixed concrete production (see 23.63)\n- electroplating, plating, and metal heat treating (see 25.61)\n- rebuilding or remanufacture of machinery (e.g. automobile engines, see 29.10)\n\nConversely, there are activities that, although sometimes involving transformation processes, are classified in other sections of NACE; in other words, they are not classified as manufacturing. They include:\n- logging, classified in section A (Agriculture, forestry and fishing);\n- beneficiating of agricultural products, classified in section A (Agriculture, forestry and fishing); \n- preparation of food for immediate consumption on the premises is classified to division 56 (Food and beverage service activities);\n- beneficiating of ores and other minerals, classified in section B (Mining and quarrying); \n- construction of structures and fabricating operations performed at the site of construction, classified in section F (Construction);\n- activities of breaking bulk and redistribution in smaller lots, including packaging, repackaging, or bottling products, such as liquors or chemicals; sorting of scrap; mixing paints to customer order; and cutting metals to customer order; treatment not resulting into a different good is classified to section G (Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles)."		
"3720"	"10"	"10"	"Manufacture of food products"	"C"	"2"	"This division includes the processing of the products of agriculture, forestry and fishing into food for humans or animals, and includes the production of various intermediate products that are not directly food products. The activity often generates associated products of greater or lesser value (for example, hides from slaughtering, or oilcake from oil production).\n\nThis division is organised by activities dealing with different kinds of products: meat, fish, fruit and vegetables, fats and oils, milk products, grain mill products, animal feeds and other food products. Production can be carried out for own account, as well as for third parties, as in custom slaughtering.\n\nSome activities are considered manufacturing (for example, those performed in bakeries, pastry shops, and prepared meat shops etc. which sell their own production) even though there is retail sale of the products in the producers' own shop. However, where the processing is minimal and does not lead to a real transformation, the unit is classified to wholesale and retail trade (section G).\n\nPreparation of food for immediate consumption on the premises is classified to division 56 (Food and beverage service activities).\n\nProduction of animal feeds from slaughter waste or by-products is classified in 10.9, while processing food and beverage waste into secondary raw material is classified to 38.3, and disposal of food and beverage waste in 38.21."

"14100"	"31"	"31"	"Manufacture of furniture"	"C"	"2"	"This division includes the manufacture of furniture and related products of any material except stone, concrete and ceramic. The processes used in the manufacture of furniture are standard methods of forming materials and assembling components, including cutting, moulding and laminating. The design of the article, for both aesthetic and functional qualities, is an important aspect of the production process.\n\nSome of the processes used in furniture manufacturing are similar to processes that are used in other segments of manufacturing. For example, cutting and assembly occurs in the production of wood trusses that are classified in division 16 (Manufacture of wood and wood products). However, the multiple processes distinguish wood furniture manufacturing from wood product manufacturing. Similarly, metal furniture manufacturing uses techniques that are also employed in the manufacture of roll-formed products classified in division 25 (Manufacture of fabricated metal products). The moulding process for plastics furniture is similar to the moulding of other plastics products. However, the manufacture of plastics furniture tends to be a specialised activity."

Wholesaling and retailing are the final steps in the distribution of merchandise. Also included in this section are the repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles.\n\nSale without transformation is considered to include the usual operations (or manipulations) associated with trade, for example sorting, grading and assembling of goods, mixing (blending) of goods (for example sand), bottling (with or without preceding bottle cleaning), packing, breaking bulk and repacking for distribution in smaller lots, storage (whether or not frozen or chilled).\n\nDivision 45 includes all activities related to the sale and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles, while divisions 46 and 47 include all other sale activities. The distinction between division 46 (wholesale) and division 47 (retail sale) is based on the predominant type of customer.\n\nWholesale is the resale (sale without transformation) of new and used goods to retailers, business-to-business trade, such as to industrial, commercial, institutional or professional users, or resale to other wholesalers, or involves acting as an agent or broker in buying merchandise for, or selling merchandise to, such persons or companies. The principal types of businesses included are merchant wholesalers, i.e. wholesalers who take title to the goods they sell, such as wholesale merchants or jobbers, industrial distributors, exporters, importers, and cooperative buying associations, sales branches and sales offices (but not retail stores) that are maintained by manufacturing or mining units apart from their plants or mines for the purpose of marketing their products and that do not merely take orders to be filled by direct shipments from the plants or mines. Also included are merchandise and commodity brokers, commission merchants and agents and assemblers, buyers and cooperative associations engaged in the marketing of farm products. \n\nWholesalers frequently physically assemble, sort and grade goods in large lots, break bulk, repack and redistribute in smaller lots, for example pharmaceuticals; store, refrigerate, deliver and install goods, engage in sales promotion for their customers and label design.\n\nRetailing is the resale (sale without transformation) of new and used goods mainly to the general public for personal or household consumption or utilisation, in shops, department stores, stalls, mail-order houses, door-to-door sales persons, hawkers, consumer cooperatives, auction houses etc. Most retailers take title to the goods they sell, but some act as agents for a principal and sell either on consignment or on a commission basis."
