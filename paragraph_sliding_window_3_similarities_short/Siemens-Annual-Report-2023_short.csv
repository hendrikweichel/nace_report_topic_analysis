1187,reducing the risk of a salesstop depends on the required correction for the nonconformity.  in case the product can technically stay as is while it has to undergo new and additional conformity assessment and certification there will be considerable effort and cost to carry out the needed testing and certification procedures.  in a worse case the affected product will need reengineering or redesign to meet the requirements of the changed or new technical regulation even before it can become reassessed and certified for market approval.  the latter case will cause significant extra effort and cost to make the needed product changes and to maintain the countryspecific product variant as an additional derivative item in the portfolio,,,,,,,0.433469721910412,,,,,,,,,,,,
1191,in the worst case if the two aforementioned ways of maintaining the products marketability prove to be not feasible we must stop selling the affected product in the market.  the uncertain geopolitical situation has triggered unpredictable  and often conflicting  extraterritorial regulations restrictions and sanctions thus creating a potential risk that it will be difficult to simultaneously comply with all relevant regulatory requirements of certain transactions.  complex crossjurisdictional regulations can vary between countries even within the same region each with slightly different rules and requirements creating a risk that a global standard cannot be effectively implemented and maintained potentially leading to a need for more custom or regional standards.  we monitor the political and regulatory landscape in all our key markets to anticipate potential problem areas with the aim of quickly adjusting our business activities and processes to changed conditions,,,,,,,0.4326680451683032,,,,,,,,,,,,
