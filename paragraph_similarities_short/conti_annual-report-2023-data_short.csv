we strive for  emission free mobility and industry by  at the latest together with our partners along the value chain. emission free refers to zero emissions of greenhouse gases and nitrogen oxides no x for example. it does not include harmless emissions such as steam nontoxic biodegradable particle emissions or minimal noise emissions.  of central importance for our ambition are the requirements and speed of transformation of our customers industries a nd markets as well as the resulting transformation opportunities and risks.  concept  continental is shaping the transformation toward emission free mobility and industry with customer oriented solutions such as for electric mobility emission free railway  engineering bicycles and wind turbines. in doing so we rely both on new product developments and on the further development of our existing product portfolio. components software and products from continental can be found in a wide range of electric vehicles for example   from tires to high performance computers and interior surfaces. for current examples of innovative products and systems from continental see the research and development section of this annual report.  the respective group sectors and business areas are responsible for implementing this sustainability ambition particularly with regard to portfolio development product strategies and business models and are supported by the group functions of the continental group. to this end relevant aspects have been and will continue to be incorporated in portfolio analyses and are included in the strategy and business development processes for the group sectors and business areas.  for the implementation of our concept  with respect to emission free mobility and industry we record our allocated

48,continental ag    annual  report   management report    sustainability and combined non financial statement     in fiscal  continental reported the performance indicator of allocated low carbon bu siness beyond business with zero tailpipe emission vehicles. the highest share of this indicator was accounted for by the replacement business with highly efficient tires with low rolling resistance. in view of the ongoing uncertainty about how tires and v arious industrial businesses can be classified as low carbon business under the various regulations e.g. eu taxonomy continental decided to discontinue reporting on allocated low carbon business beyond business with zero tailpipe emission vehicles in fiscal  and to develop a new reporting approach going forward.  results of the concept  in fiscal  the allocated business with zero tailpipe emission  vehicles amounted to   million py   million. the year onyear growth is attributable in  particular to the growing market success of electric mobility since continentals products can now be found in many mass produced models.  emission free mobility and industry      allocated business with zero tailpipe emission vehicles in millions of euros        definition allocated business with zero tailpipe emission vehicles comprises all business with products for vehicles transporting goods and people.   the business can be allocated via the vehicle manufacturer the vehicle platform or the product specification for example. the data includes both pure business and attributable business such as in the case of combined vehicle platforms. for the tires contitech and contract manufacturing group secto rs the sales reported at the end of the year were included. in the case of the automotive group sector a calculation was carried out for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles using internal vehicle specific planning data for sales and external da ta for production quantities and for medium and heavy commercial vehicles this was based on the relevant customer portfolio.  for more information on emission free mobility and industry see the integrated sustainability report on our website at  www.cont

along the value chain.  of central importance for our ambition are the requirements and speed of transformation of our customers industries and markets as well as the resulting transformation opportunities and risks.  concept  the switch to a circular economy is a profound and c omplex transformation process for continental which at the same time is highly relevant for the achievement of other topic areas of the companys sustainability ambition. the group sectors are responsible for implementing circularity in particular with r espect to product design business models material use and material procurement. they have each started to design andor implement specific initiatives and projects that are aimed at improving the use of product related technological and biological cycle s. in addition work is continuously being done on the durability recyclability and adaptability of products. to cite some examples   in the reporting year the automotive group sector become a partner of the international circ uits project circular inte gration of independent reverse supply chains for the smart reuse of industrially relevant semiconductors. the aim of the project is to develop sustainable methods based on innovative technologies that can be used in the circular model to manufacture new components and products with high added value and an improved environmental footprint as well as to provide solutions for the reuse of semiconductors and mechanical parts.   together with partner pyrum innovations the tires group sector is currently developing various processes to further optimize and expand the recycling of scrap tires through pyrolysis. since september   the carbon black recovered in this process has been used at the korbach tire plant for solid tires fitted primarily on forklift trucks. it is also set to be used in more and more of continentals rubber compounds in the future.   the contitech group sector has launched skai rpet purelux  a plain colored furniture film made from  recycled pet polymer which conserves natural resources . for more information see the respective press release on our  website under  press.  with regard to operational waste management as a further key component of the circular economy we have set ourselves the corporate target of increasing the waste for recovery quota to  by . waste for recovery includes material recycling thermal recovery or any other form of recycling or reuse. this objective gives priority to recycling over disposal. the implementation of the corporate target is managed by grou p environmental and climate  protection as part of operational environmental management.  for more information on the organization of operational environmental management see the section on green and safe factories  in this

partners along the value chain.  our understanding of a responsible value chain thus refers to our supply chain and customer relationships and to our own locations.  of central importance for our ambition are the requirements and speed of transformation of our customers industries and markets as well as the resulting transformation opportunities and risks.  concept continental operates in complex global value chains that are exposed to a variet y of risks associated with the violat ion of pro tected rights. risks within this context are always related to the potential negative impact on people and the environment.  continental has therefore established a comprehensive management system for ensuring its due diligence obligations in order to identify risks in connection with defined protected  rights within its supply chain and in its own business units. for this purpose r esponsibilities rules  and processes have been clearly defined for this purpose  including riskmitigation measures and control mechanisms. the responsible value chain due diligence system rvcdds focuses on the pro tected  rights defined by us and will be developed further in line with the development of dynamic economic social and environmental requirements. the rvcdds applies to continental  ag and to all subsidiaries in which the continental group exercises a controlling  influence.  the executive board of continental  ag is updated on the current status by the continental groups human rights officer at least once a year and deci des on the systems effectiveness appropriateness and potential for improvement. it then propos es any suitable improvements to the rvcdds where necessary either to the system as a whole or to selected elements. the rvcdds is additionally integrated into continentals overarching internal control system risk management system and compliance management system. as a key prevention measure at corporate level continental has adopted responsible value chain commitments rvc commitments  that are accessible online at  www.continental sustainability.com. these commitments address the defined risk categor ies and formulate what is expected of the companys own business units and employees as well as of its direct suppliers. the rvc commitments surpass the minimum legal requirements especially when it comes to working conditions. on top of this continenta l has anchored further prevention measures in its own business units and with respect to direct suppliers.  within the rvcdds our code of conduct defines the fundamental requirements for our employees while the  business partner code of conduct defines the fundamen tal requirements among others for our suppliers as well as their suppliers with regard to human rights working conditions environmental protection conflict minerals and anti corruption. the business partner code of conduct is updated regularly most r ecently in fiscal  to reflect changes or adjustments to relevant legislation. for suppliers of  natural rubber our sourcing policy for sustainable natural rubber additionally applies.  the existing corporate wide whistleblower system within continental ag the continental integrity hotline was expanded as part of the legal requirements under the german supply chain due diligence act lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz  and is available both to employees within the continental group as well as perso ns outside the company. the integrity hotline is open for information on potential violations of human rights and environmental rights among other issues. alongside the whistleblower system a range of other resources are used to investigate potential protected  right violations and implement preventive and remedial measures where necessary.  the rvcdds additionally defines the framework for taking remedial measures within the companys own business units as well as toward direct suppliers and should the situation arise also toward indirect suppliers. sustainability aspects are also taken into consideration at various other points in supplier management. for example selected suppliers are evaluated based on various criteria using selfassessment questionnaires which we collect via the generally accepted sustainability platforms for our industries such as ecovadis and nqc. these questionnaires are reviewed annually at the corporate level.

staff in management positions and to those performing special functions.  to further increase transparency and sustainability in contin entals natural rubber supply chain the activities of the joint venture rubberway which was founded in  were rolled out further for the digital risk analysis of the upstream supply chain. the joint project with the deutsche gesellschaft für intern ationale zusammen arbeit giz in the indonesian province of west kalimantan which has been in place since  was also further expanded. the aim of the project is to jointly drive forward the implementation of a digital system for the traceability of n atural rubber from the project region. optimizing the supply chain and offering training in the sustainable farming  of natural rubber  helps smallholders to increase  the quantity quality and yield of their produce thus  improving their income. in addition  a cultivation strategy designed around sustainability prevents clearing and deforestation thereby conserving valuable resources. as part of a development project with security matters smx continental is working on testing a tamper proof means of verification of the geographical origin of natural rubber using marker technologies. in  field testing was successfully completed and the marker substance could be verified beyond doubt throughout the entire tire production process.  as at december     valid supplier self assessment questionnaires were available via the two sustainability platforms ecovadis and nqc py . this corresponds to a completion rate of  of suppliers selected for this

ambition we implement effective management processes fair business practices and responsible corporate governance with a balanced view of different perspectives.  concept  group compliance which is divided into a central team and regional functions is responsible for preventing violations in the areas of corruption antitrust law money laundering and data protection. this structure is supplemented by compliance coordinators in the countries and at the locations. the comp liance manual sets out how the compliance management system is designed and implemented.   continental strives for a holistic and proactive compliance management system based on a comprehensive and predictive analysis of potential compliance risks followed  by the implementation of appropriate policies and procedures training consulting monitoring and controls that lead to ongoing lessons learned and system improvements. the integrity hotline is the primary tool  for support with detecting violations.  when  it comes to preventing violations in the area of technical compliance responsibility lies with the group quality technical compliance cbs and environment group function together with the central functions for quality and technical compliance within the group sectors. the technical compliance policy as well as the technical compliance management system manual and other procedural standards set out how the compliance management system is designed and implemented.  a network of supporting roles in the various functions within the group sectors business areas segments and sites is being devised and expanded on an ongoing basis in order to support the identification of risks and other technical compliance considerations.  the appropriateness and effectivenes s of the risk and compliance management systems are monitored and assessed as part of continentals overarching internal control system. on top of this  integrity perception  is measured using a newly defined indicator. this new indicator was applied for the first time in . it is based on specific questions asked within the context of the annual our basics live survey and expresses employees perception of key aspects involved in implementing our integrity ambition within the organization. it is theref ore characterized by subjective impressions and estimates that reveal whether the systems are having the intended

54,continental ag    annual  report   management report    sustainability and combined non financial statement     the eu taxonomy is a classification system for determining sustainable economic activities in the real economy. the following disclosures are the mandatory disclosures of the continental group in accordance with a rt.  of eu taxonomy regulation .  specific information on the implementation of disclosure requirements in accordance with the eu taxonomy regulation  since january    companies in the real economy have had  to provide information on taxonomy eligibility and taxonomy alignment with regard to the two climate objectives of the climate delegated act under eu taxonomy regulation . in june   the environmental delegated act under eu taxonomy regulation  was published containing  the activities and technical assessment criteria for the four remaining environmental objectives. the six environmental objectives of the eu taxonomy are   climate change mitigation   climate change adaptation   sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources   transition to a circular economy   pollution prevention and control   protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems  publication of the environmental delegated act under eu taxonomy regulation  was accompanied by the introduction of amendments to the climate delegated act comprising changes to the existing activities for the two climate objectives as well the inclusion of new economic activities for the two climate objectives. this affects among others the two economic activities of category . manufacture of automotive and mobility components and category . manufacture of rail rolling stock constit uents. furthermore the eu commission made it explicit in recital  of delegated regulation  amending delegated regulation  that the activity of tire manufacturing because  of its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the t ransport sector is a taxonomy eligible activity that is currently to be allocated to category . manufacture of other low carbon technologies.  while the amendments to the climate delegated act do clear up some existing ambiguities in terms of how the regulation is to be interpreted when it comes to the taxonomy eligibility of continentals economic activities reporting pursuant to the eu taxonomy regulation remains fraught with uncertainty for continental. this is mainly because unclear wording cont inues to be used in the regulations and notes on determining taxonomy eligibility and in particular taxonomy alignment as well as the calculations for key performance indicators for turnover capital expenditure and operating expenditure as they pertain t o the economic activities relevant for continental. as a result these regulations and notes are still open to interpretation.  from continentals perspective there is also uncertainty about the interaction between the various regulations delegated acts and official answers to frequently asked questions. furthermore the short implementation period granted by the delegated act published in  means that many questions of interpretation related to implementation have not yet been conclusively clarified. in interpreting the regulation we also take into consideration the assessments of industry associations in the supplier and automotive industries the reporting practices of european suppliers for  and unofficial assessments by various experts.  taxono my eligible economic activities  as part of our sustainability ambition we strive for carbon neutrality and emission free mobility and industry by  at the latest see also the sections on carbon neutrality and on emission free mobility and industry in this combined non financial statement and thus for the expansion of clean and carbon neutral mobility. with this in mind we have introduced performance indicators at  a corporate level as part of our sustainability scorecard with the aim of monitoring o ur progress. in the previous year we used this scorecard to classify the allocated business with emission free mobility and industry as the indicator that comprises all economic activities to be disclosed for continental as taxonomy eligible with respect to the environmental target of climate change mitigation in accordance with the eu taxonomy regulation. it consisted of allocated business with zero tailpipe emission vehicles and allocated lowcarbon business beyond business with zero tailpipe emission vehicles. this business was therefore classified under category . manufacture of other low carbon technologies of the delegated regulation for climate change mitigation eu  annex i in the previous year since at the time no general regulations or specific upstream economic activities were provided for. the introduction of category . manufacture of automotive and mobility components and category . manufacture of rail rolling stock constituents coupled with the updated approach t o the activity of tire manufacturing resulted in the reclassification of various continental economic activities reported as taxonomy eligible in the reporting year compared with  as well as a significant increase in sales  capital expenditure and operating expenditure.  in the reporting year we allocated all economic activities involved in the manufacture of automotive and mobility systems and components for road vehicles   with the exception of tires but also extending beyond components for zero tailpipe emission vehicles    to category .. continental is of the opinion that the manufacture of all components irrespective of the drive system is taxonomy eligible for all vehicles belonging to the vehicle classes listed  in the category. this class ification is based on the fact that from continentals perspective the activity designation does not entail any restrictions in terms of components for example in relation  to function or drive system and the corresponding components parts and systems are intended for use in road vehicles. the unclearly defined qualification characteristic criterion of activity .  essential contribution to environmental performance   is in continentals view part of the assessment of taxonomy alignment and not taxonomy eligibility. alternative interpretations were examined but they were found to be unsuitable by continental.

55,continental ag    annual report   management report    sustainability and combined non financial statement     we allocated all economic activities involved in the manufacture of rail rolling stock constituents to category .. this classification is based in particular on the fact that from continentals perspective the reference to activity . does not impose any restrictions on components in relation to the function or drive system of rail vehicles for which the components are manufactured pr ovided that the components and systems are necessary for the operation and functioning of rail vehicles. furthermore the activity designation does not entail any restrictions on components for example in  relation to function or drive system.  in contras t to the previous year in the reporting year all activities involved in tire manufacturing were classified as taxonomy eligible under category .. in recital  of delegated regulation   amending delegated regulation  the commission made it clear that tire manufacturing has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector and can contribute to a more circular economy. until specific technical assessment criteria are defined for this activity tire manufacturing  shall remain a taxonomy eligible activity under category . manufacture of other low carbon technologies. it is continentals opinion that this clarification for the purposes of taxonomy eligibility refers to the manufacture of tires of all kinds wi thout any restrictions in terms of specific properties label classes or drive system technologies. based on this clarification continental has amended its approach compared with the previous year and now allocates the manufacture of tires of all kinds w ithout any restrictions in terms  of specific properties label classes or drive system technologies to category .. alternative interpretations were also examined here but they were found to be unsuitable by continental particularly with regard to recital .  in addition various continental industrial businesses will continue to be reported as taxonomy eligible as they were in the previous year. in the reporting year these primarily comprised the manufacture of components for wind turbines and th e manufacture of materials for industrial plant insulation. continental still allocates these businesses to category . manufacture of other low carbon technologies since the economic activities pursue substantial reductions and therefore make signif icant contributions to the expansion of renewable energies and energy saving for example through insulation in industrial plants. for these classifications as well continental believes it is irrelevant which functions are fulfilled by the supplier techno logies in the end products as long as the end product facilitates the goals set out in art.    of the taxonomy regulation . the activities mentioned are not identified as taxonomy eligible  under annex ii to the climate delegated act climate change  adaptation.  all other economic activities of the continental group that are not included in the aforementioned economic activities have been classified as taxonomy noneligible for the reporting year. accordingly continental currently has not allocated a ny economic activities to the other environmental objectives under annex i sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources annex ii transition to a circular economy annex iii pollution prevention and control or annex iv protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.  we base the classification on the information publicly available at the time the report was prepared.  taxonomy eligible turnover  the information on turnover is prepared in accordance with section  .. of annex  t o the delegated regulation on disclosure obligations  and in compliance with ifrs accounting regulations see tables at the end of this non financial statement. the method of determination selected by continental ensures that double counting is  avoided.  the described first time classification of all tire manufacturing activities as taxonomy eligible under category . and the first time classification of all other economic activities involved in the manufacture of automotive and mobility systems and components for road vehicles as taxonomy eligible under category . resulted  in a significant increase in taxonomy eligible turnover in the reporting year. added to this was the first time classification of other economic activities involved in th e manufacture of rail rolling stock constituents as taxonomy eligible under category .. in addition various continental industrial businesses were reported as taxonomy eligible under category . as they were in the previous year. a  total sum of .  billion was reported as taxonomy eligible turnover in the reporting year py .  billion equivalent to . of total consolidated sales py .. the breakdown of taxonomy eligible turnover by category is shown in the table on page  . information on the continental groups total turnover the denominator of the key figure calculation can be found in the consoli dated statement of income of this annual report under sales.  taxonomy eligible capital expenditure and operating expenditure  taxonomy eligible capital expenditure and operating expenditure have been recorded in accordance with the delegated regulation on disclosure obligations  and taking into account the clarifications made by the european commission in october .  the figures for taxonomy eligible capital expenditure and operating expenditure under category a are allocations based on the p roportion of taxonomy eligible turnover. for reasons connected to the business model the equipment machinery and buildings of the continental group are thus used both for taxonomy eligible activities and for other activities. this applies both to capital  expenditure and operating expenditure for assets or processes associated with taxonomy eligible activities category a.  the allocation takes place at group sector level and not according to the individual locations in order to avoid double counting ta ke into account internal business and consolidation effects and reflect the continental groups matrix structure. this allocation of turnover thus reflects the distribution of continentals production. the platform on sustainable finance also recommends su ch an approach to allocation in its report to the commission dated october  . this states  for enabling activities that capital expenditure and operating expenditure should be reported on the basis of their proportion of turnover provided the activities are taxonomy eligible and that they not do not include activities that are taxonomy

 measures short term leasing and maintenance and repairs.  the expanded interpretation of economic activities classified as taxonomy eligible in the reporting year likewise led to a significant increase in taxonomy eligible operating expenditure. a total sum  of .  millio n was reported as taxonomy eligible operating expenditure in the reporting year py .  million equivalent  to . of total operating expenditure py .. the breakdown of taxonomy eligible operating expenditure by category is shown in the table  on page  . when determining the taxonomy eligible capital expenditure and operating expenditure for reasons of materiality the decision was made to forgo separate reporting of investments in individual measures and the acquisition of products from taxon omy eligible economic activities under category c as well as reporting of the  resulting operating expenditure in the reporting year.  continental notes that from its perspective various interpretations with respect to the requirements concerning capital  expenditure and operating expenditure particularly for category c and for operating expenditure more generally continue to result in uncertainty when determining taxonomy related information.  taxonomy aligned economic activities  as in the previous year continental did not report any economic activities as being taxonomy aligned.  for all economic activities that are reported under category . specific comparative life cycle assessments are required in order to also report these as being t axonomy aligned. these must demonstrate substantial savings to life cycle emissions compared with the highest performing alternative technology or solution available on the market or the highest performing alternative product available on the market. exter nal verification of the life cycle assessments must also take place in accordance with predefined standards. a simplified life cycle consideration as called for by the taxonomy regulation  itself is no longer sufficient in accordance with the d elegated regulation for climate change mitigation  for category .. continental did not have the corresponding life cycle assessments at its disposal in the reporting year meaning it is currently not possible to allocate taxonomy aligned econo mic activities. for this reason the do no significant harm dnsh criteria and the minimum protection requirements along the value chain were not assessed according to specific economic activities.  it was not yet mandatory in the reporting year to repor t taxonomy aligned economic activities if the economic activities are reported according to the categories . and . which have been newly integrated into the climate delegated act.  since continental does not currently report any activities as taxonomyaligned no taxonomy aligned capital expenditure or operating expenditure according to categories a and b has been reported. since no taxonomy eligible capital expenditure or operating expenditure under category c was identified no taxonomy aligned capi tal expenditure or operating expenditure under category c  has been reported.,0.3620960998001371,0.3644156915839192,0.3984800533767952,0.3707851785785639,0.3557908574429186,0.4014718633634742,0.4398132309026258,0.3848051702707806,0.3751365601355449,0.309540206781493,0.375492708314607,0.2728610589968234,0.2852560161460629,0.3709505041272941,0.2998958557708586,0.2963725074306437,0.1240156470430078,0.1700669266132828,0.3568116463261715

weighing more than  metric tons grew significantly year onyear in our core european market in the reporting period thanks to stabilized supply chains. production increased in eastern and central euro

medium and heavy commercial vehicles by  according to preliminary figures.  development of replacement tire mark ets for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles  in both europe and north america demand for replacement tires initially declined in the year under review. the effects of inflation  resulted in significant purchasing restraint among consumers in  the first half of the year in particular and the levels of stock among dealers led to a reduced need for stockpiling. in north america a strong second half of the year compensated for the weak start while the replacement tire markets in europe were down yea ronyear overall. by contrast the chinese market grew significantly.  sales volumes of replacement tires for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles weighing less

automotive industry the development of various other industries is crucial to the success of our contitech group sector. conti tech products are used in particular in equipment machinery and vehicles for railway transport mining agriculture and other key industries. as well as the general development of gross domestic product the development of industrial production is therefo re  regarded as an important indicator for contitechs business with  industrial customers.  in the reporting period industrial production in the eurozone continued to be affected by increased costs and was down year onyear as a whole. in the usa as well  industrial production saw only a slight increase in  remaining more or less constant year onyear. china on the other hand recorded significant growth in industrial production compared with the previous year which was influenced by lockdowns and other factors.  development of raw materials markets  compared with previous years the development of raw materials markets in the year under review was largely stable due to an overall improvement in availability. global supply chains also returned to mor e normal levels. this was also reflected in less volatile price developments particularly for metals. although a decline in price volatility was observed for products such as crude oil and butadiene prices still fluctuated significantly in some cases. ov erall however they were roughly on a par with the level seen at the start of  at the end of the reporting period.  carbon steel and stainless steel are input materials for many of the

92,continental ag    annual report   management report    report on risks and opportunities    the overall situation is analyzed and managed corporate wide using the risk  and opportunity management system.  as an integral part of the corporate strategy continentals risk strategy is aligned with the companys strategic objectives and is currently being further formalized and developed. it aims to create long term value while also taking into account the differentiation between the individual group sector s. we evaluate risks and opportunities continually and responsibly to achieve our goal of adding value.  we define risk as the possibility of internal or external events occurring that can have a negative influence on the attainment of our strategic and operational targets. as a global corporation continental is exposed to a number of different risks that could impair business and in extreme cases threaten the companys existence. at the same time we aim to resolutely seize opportunities  that arise as described in the strategy of the continental group section. we accept manageable risks if the resulting opportunities are expected to result in sustainable growth in value. we consider growth in value in terms of the continental value contr ibution cvc system described in the corporate management section.  continentals internal control and  risk management system  the governance systems at continental comprise the i nternal control system ics the risk management system rms and   as a subcomponent of these systems  the compliance management system. the risk management system in turn also includes the early risk identification system in accordance with section     of the german stock corporation act aktiengesetz  aktg .  the executive board is responsible for the governance systems which include all subsidiaries. the supervisory board and its audit committee monitor the effectiveness of these systems.  main characteristics of the internal control system  in order to operate successfully as a company in a complex business environment and to ensure the effectiveness efficiency and propriety of all processes and compliance with the relevant legal and sub legislative regulations continental has established an internal control system that encompasses all relevant business processes. certain aspects of sustainability are also considered and continuously further developed in compliance with the regulat ory framework. the management and monitoring of the internal control system are currently being incorporated into a holistic ics governance system.  the governance risk and compliance grc committee chaired by the executive board member responsible for i ntegrity and law and the executive board member responsible for finance controlling and it is responsible for monitoring the internal control system and the risk management system and  as part of these systems  the compliance management system.  key el ements of the corporate wide internal control system are the clear allocation of responsibilities and system inherent controls in the respective process flows. the two person rule and separation  of functions are fundamental principles of this organization . continentals management also issues guidelines to ensure that all business processes are conducted in an economical orderly and legally compliant manner. guidelines specific to the continental group and to its individual group sectors are managed centr ally in the house of rules and are thus available to all continental employees.  based on these fundamental principles and the globally applicable guidelines the internal control system at continental follows the three lines model.  in the first line  system inherent controls are configured in the companys it systems to support the orderly and economical execution of all process flow transactions in accordance with the corporate wide guidelines. at the same time these transactional controls help to iden tify risks and deviations that require separate consideration. as the controls and process flows established in the first line apply to continentals operating business they are generally put in place at the level of our operating units such as our subsi diaries business areas and group sectors.  in the second line  of our internal control system guidelines for process flows are developed implemented and updated and compliance with controls and guidelines is monitored. responsibility for this lies primarily with the group functions in addition to the business area s and group sectors. the responsibilities include for example the risk management system and the compliance management system. in order to perform this supervisory and monitoring function an integrated reporting system has been established that includes  for example the financial reporting internal control system financial reporting ics the general risk management system the compliance risk management system and the tax compliance management system. the supervisory and monitoring function is perform ed on the basis of regular reports and supplemented as needed with effectiveness tests as part of self audits and regular internal and external reviews.  the compliance management system plays an important role within the second line of defense by helping t o prevent detect and respond to compliance violations. the group compliance group function is responsible for the compliance management system. report on risks and

93,continental ag    annual report   management report    report on risks and opportunities    the chief compliance officer reports directly to the executive board member responsible for integrity and law. the work done by group compliance focuses mainly on preventing and detecting corruption fraud and other property offenses violations of antitrust and competition law and money laundering implementing data protection and responding to compliance violati ons. for other legal areas in which there is a risk of compliance violations  such as taxes customs sanctions and export controls and qualitytechnical compliance  responsibility for appropriate and effective compliance management lies with the respec tive functions which are supported in these tasks by group compliance.  an effective culture of compliance is the basis for prevention. it begins with setting an appropriate tone from the top by the executive board and management and in addition to ris k analysis includes in particular employee training compliance consulting and the internal publication of guidelines.  in the course of risk analysis the business activities of continental are examined for compliance risks within the scope of top down as  well as bottom up review processes. the risk of compliance violations arises primarily from organizational structures and workflows the given market situation activities in certain geographical regions inappropriate incentive systems conflicts of interest and criminal intent on the part of individual employees. furthermore findings from investigations by the group internal audit group function as well as discussions with management and employees at all hierarchical levels are taken into account. this  risk analysis  is not a one off procedure but is performed annually and continuously updated.  prevention is also fostered by consultation on specific matters with group compliance and by the internal publication of guidelines on topics such as anti corru ption including giving and receiving gifts as well as donations and sponsoring antitrust and competition law antimoney laundering and data protection. in training events group compliance addresses topics directly related to everyday compliance issues  and challenges. continental introduced the business partner code of conduct to prevent compliance violations by suppliers service providers representatives or similar third parties. this must be recognized as a basic requirement for doing business with continental.  in the context of detection continental has set up an integrity hotline to give employees and third parties outside the continental group the opportunity to report violations of legal regulations its fundamental values and ethical standards.  information on any kind of potential violations including accounting manipulation can be reported anonymously via this hotline. the hotline is available worldwide in many different languages. the companys investigating units rigorously pursue any and a ll substantiated leads.  detection also includes the support of regular and incident related audits conducted by group internal audit. compliance related issues are regularly the subject of audits by group internal audit.  responses are aimed at implementing measures as a consequence of identified compliance violations. group compliance is involved in decision making on measures that may be required including thorough analysis to ensure that isolated incidents are not symptoms of failings in the system. in  this way corresponding gaps can be closed preventively and the compliance management system as well as the internal control system can be systematically developed.  when it comes to preventing violations in the area of technical compliance responsibili ty lies with the group quality technical compliance cbs and environment group function supported by the central functions within the group sectors. the technical compliance policy as well as the technical compliance management system manual and other pr ocedural standards set out how the compliance management system is designed and implemented.  a network of supporting roles in the various functions within the group sectors business areas segments and sites is being devised and expanded on an ongoing bas is in order to support the identification of risks and other technical compliance considerations.  the third line  of our internal control system is our group internal audit group function.  group internal audit serves an independent and objective auditing and advisory function applying a systematic approach to help review assess and improve the adequacy and effectiveness of the organizations governance systems. continentals executive board authorizes group internal audit to conduct audits in all regions  companies or functions of continental  ag and its affiliated fully consolidated subsidiaries worldwide.  group internal audit prepares an annual risk oriented audit plan that is submitted to continentals executive board for review and approval. in addition to its planned general audits group internal audit also conducts special investigations. these are bas ed on tips and information about fraudulent acts received from internal or  external sources such as the integrity hotline or the ombudsmans office.  group internal audit regularly reports its audit and investigation  results to the executive board and the  audit committee. significant risks and potential improvements to internal controls are presented as part of the reporting to the aforementioned bodies. the implementation by management of the measures recommended in the course of audits is also monitored by group internal audit and reported to the executive board and the audit committee.,,,0.3182133801693287,,,0.2795847435126466,0.4469007354169699,,,0.2983306811298299,,0.1670632271547069,0.2313188983559457,0.2928273741914478,0.3080491112496805,0.175691913348163,0.0935502225209212,,0.2991092339043255

establishes the framework for a uniform risk culture.  the grc syst em incorporates all components of risk reporting and the examination of the effectiveness of the financial reporting ics. risks are identified assessed and reported at the organizational level that is also responsible for managing the identified risks. a multi stage assessment process is used to involve also the higher level organizational units. the grc system thus includes all reporting levels from the company level to the top corporate level.  at the corporate level the responsibilities of the grc comm ittee include identifying material risks for the continental group based on a multi stage reporting process as well as complying with and implementing the grc policy. the grc committee regularly informs the executive board and the audit committee of the supervisory board of the material risks any weaknesses in the control system and measures taken. moreover the auditor is required to report to the audit committee of the supervisory board regarding any material weaknesses in the financial reporting ics w hich they have identified as part of their audit activities.  a period under consideration of one year is always applied when evaluating risks and opportunities. risks and their effects are assessed using an end toend gross and net assessment methodology t hat helps to identify the impact of risk mitigation measures. risks are assessed primarily according to quantitative criteria in various categories. if a risk cannot be assessed quantitatively then it is assessed qualitatively based on the potential negat ive effects its occurrence would have on achieving corporate goals and based on other qualitative criteria such as the impact on continentals reputation. risks and opportunities are not offset.  material individual risks for the continental group are ident ified from all the reported risks based on the probability of occurrence and the potential amount of damage that would be caused in the period under consideration. quantified risks are based on ebit  effect and free cash flow effect.  the individual risks t hat continental has classified as material and the aggregated risks that have been assigned to risk categories are all described in the report on risks and opportunities provided the potential negative effect of an individual risk or the sum of risks included in a category exceeds   million in the period under consideration or there is a significant negative impact on the corporate goals.  the risk inventory aggregated using a monte carlo simulation is compared with the risk bearing capacity determined  on the reporting date taking into account possible interactions and quantitative assumptions on qualitatively assessed risks and is supplemented by a qualitative assessment by the grc committee on overarching nonquantifiable risks in order to derive a statement on the potential risk to the continental group.,,0.3029981483331816,,0.3239322630860979,0.2994918601484848,0.2536516619758326,0.379049684653311,,0.2506215930717255,0.2750633468003058,0.3736687826271105,,0.2548813510503057,0.3059264120089492,0.2266362059606638,0.1952310399875792,0.0817180821819334,0.1047621461128863,
95,continental ag    annual report   management report    report on risks and opportunities    local management can utilize various instruments for risk assessment such as predefined risk categories e.g. exchange rate risks product liability risks legal risks and assessment criteria centrally developed function specific questionnaires as well as the financial reporting icss process and control descriptions. the key controls in business processes purchase to pay order to cash asset management hr it authorizations the financial statement closing process and sustainability reporting are th us tested with respect to their effectiveness.  all major subsidiaries carry out a semiannual assessment of business related risks and an annual assessment of compliance risks in the grc systems it aided risk management application. any quality legal and compliance cases that have actually occurred are also taken into account when assessing these risks. the grc system likewise encompasses the tax compliance management system the customs compliance management system and the export control compliance manage ment system in order to ensure standard and regular review and reporting of pertinent risks. the quarterly financial reporting ics completes regular grc reporting.  in the reporting year continental redesigned its process for identifying and reporting str ategic risks and began implementing these procedures in the established grc process. any new material risks arising ad hoc between regular reporting dates have to be reported immediately and considered by the grc committee. these also include risks identified in the audits performed by group functions.  in addition to the risk analyses carried out by the reporting units as part of integrated grc audits are also performed by group internal audit. furthermore the various controlling functions analyze the key figures provided as part of this reporting process at corporate and group sector level in order to assess the effects of potential risks.  for each risk identified the responsible management team initiates appropriate countermeasures which for material r isks are also documented in the grc system. the grc committee monitors and consolidates the material risks and suitable countermeasures at the corporate level. it regularly reports to the executive board and recommends further measures if needed. the exec utive board discusses and resolves the measures and reports to the supervisory boards audit committee. the responsible bodies continually monitor the development of all identified risks and the progress of actions initiated. group internal audit regularly  audits the risk management process thereby continually monitoring its effectiveness and further development.,0.2152453873198969,0.3239990348278697,0.3346053566762875,0.3126411830352015,0.3009508212471442,0.297246122375863,0.3994499146779475,0.3144336772876313,0.2673892735177246,0.2703150419194384,0.3553343971297679,0.1638586395721243,0.2804767851770223,0.3181194820320976,0.2477218079571868,0.2018895434032687,0.0916618428066612,0.1215044081143557,0.2933143913533924
96,continental ag    annual report   management report    report on risks and opportunities    appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control and risk management system  the executive board based its assessment of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control and risk management system on the findings from routine internal reporting but in particular also on function specific statements on the internal control and risk management system as well as an as sessment of these by group internal audit which were consolidated into an overall statement by the grc committee. these statements together with the overall statement by the grc committee are intended to offer an overview of key activities and controls that have been implemented summarize measures for reviewing appropriateness and effectiveness and indicate critical weaknesses in the control system as well as any related improvement measures.  the function specific statements collected on the basis of a risk oriented selection process included various aspects in accordance with the implemented three lines model. in the first line documented processes and controls were checked with respect to whether these were in place and had been implemented as was  any communication relating to these elements. responsibility for guidelines and process flows lies in particular with the second line which  within the scope of the review of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control and risk managem ent system including the compliance management system  is generally also satisfied with respect to the status of implementation of the regulations based on random checks as well as the processing of external supporting documentation such as certificatio n in line with the international organization for standardization iso the trusted information security assessment exchange tisax and the international automotive task force iatf. these not only reinforce compliance with regulatory provisions but al so underscore the appropriate and effective operation of systems implemented at continental in accordance with industry standards. monitoring the internal control system and risk management system is one of the core tasks of group internal audit the third  line. as part of its audits group internal audit assesses the implementation of risk control measures and internal controls conducted with the help of recognized standards and methods. deviations and weaknesses noted are summarized in a report for the r elevant persons responsible and any improvement measures initiated. significant risks and potential improvements to internal controls are presented as part of the reporting to the executive board and the audit committee. the implementation by management o f the measures recommended in the course of audits is also monitored by group internal audit and reported to the executive board and the audit committee.  the internal control and risk management system including the compliance management system of contin ental  ag is undergoing a continuous process of improvement in order to expand existing processes and controls and meet new regulatory challenges. currently this mainly includes implementing a technical compliance management system and improving it governance and data compliance. in addition the global reorganization of the customs and export control functions is currently being driven forward and transferred to a comprehensive compliance management system. in a cross domain project work is also be ing done on a reinforced integrative approach and expansion of the governance functions.  based on the statements from the respective functional areas the assessment of these by group internal audit and the consolidated overall statement by the grc committ ee no matters have come to the executive boards attention that would suggest that the internal control and risk management system including the compliance management system was inappropriate or ineffective in all material respects in fiscal .  never theless there are inherent limitations to any internal control or risk management system including the compliance management system. even a system considered appropriate and effective does not offer any guarantee that all risks or violations that have actually occurred will be uncovered in advance or that any process disruptions can be entirely ruled out.  opportunity management  as part of our opportunity management activities we assess market and economic analyses and changes in legal requirements e.g. with regard to fuel consumption and emission standards as well as safety regulations. in addition we deal with the corresponding effects on the sectors and markets relevant to

portfolio.,,0.3406195768594194,0.3599275415786047,0.323643266655689,0.2679941400919587,0.3058214551623472,,,,0.2462244760455708,,,0.2993929762996276,,0.2195111099260556,0.2278786517240856,0.0783356441303485,,
97,continental ag    annual report   management report    report on risks and opportunities    material risks  the order of the risk categories and individual risks presented within the four risk groups reflects the current assessment of the relative risk exposure for c ontinental and thus provides an indication of the current significance of these risks. if no quantitative information on the amount of damage is provided the assessment  is carried out on the basis of qualitative criteria. unless the emphasis is placed on  a specific group sector the risks apply to all group sectors.  financial risks  continental is exposed to risks in connection with its financing agreements and the syndicated loan.  continental is subject to risks in connection with its financing agreement s. risks arise from the bonds that continental  ag and conti gummi finance b.v. maastricht netherlands have issued as part of the debt issuance programme dip. these financing agreements contain covenants that could limit continentals capacity to take action as well as change ofcontrol provisions.  in order to finance current business activities as well as investments and payment obligations a syndicated loan agreement is in place from which risks may arise. under the terms of the syndicated loan agreement the lenders have the right to demand repayment of the loan in the event of a change of control at continental  ag. the requirements for and consequences of a change in control in accordance with the terms of the bonds or the syndicated loan agreemen t are described in detail in the additional disclosures and notes pursuant to sections a and a hgb  section on pages  and . the loans and bonds cited here could also immediately become due and payable if other financing agreements of more than  . million are not repaid on time or are prematurely called for repayment. continental continuously monitors compliance with the applicable conditions.  the committed volume of the syndicated loan consists of a revolving tranche of .  billion due in dece mber  . as at the end of fiscal  .  million of the revolving tranche had been utilized.  continental is exposed to risks associated with changes in currency exchange rates and hedging.  continental operates worldwide and is therefore exposed to financial risks that arise from changes in exchange rates. this could result in losses if assets denominated in currencies with a falling exchange rate lose value andor liabilities denominated in currencies with a rising exchange rate appreciate. in addition fluctuations in exchange rates could intensify or reduce fluctuations in the prices of raw materials in euros as continental sources a considerable portion of its raw materials in foreign currency. as a result of these factors fluctuations in excha nge rates can influence continentals earnings situation.  external and internal transactions involving the delivery of products and services to third parties and companies of the continental group can result in cash inflows and outflows that are denominate d in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary of the continental group transaction risk. to the extent that cash outflows of the respective subsidiary of the continental group in any one foreign currency are not offset b y cash flows resulting from operational business in the same currency the remaining net exchange rate risk is hedged against on a case bycase basis using the appropriate derivative instruments particularly currency forwards currency swaps and currency options with a term of up to  months.  moreover continental is exposed to exchange rate risks arising from external and internal loan agreements that result in cash inflows and outflows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the  respective subsidiary of the continental group. these exchange rate risks are in general hedged against by using appropriate derivative instruments particularly currency forwards currency swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps. any hedging transac tions executed in the form of derivative instruments can result in losses.  in order to quantify the possible effects of transaction related  exchange rate risks from financial instruments on the earnings  position of the continental group transaction curr encies with a  significant exchange rate risk within the next  months are identified based on current net exposure. if the exchange rates of these currencies all develop disadvantageously for continental at the same time then the hypothetical negative effect on the continental groups earnings position calculated based on a  change in the current closing rate would amount to between   million and   million.  continental is exposed to default risks in connec tion with cash and cash equivalents derivative instruments and interest bearing investments.  in order to minimize the default risk for cash and cash equivalents derivative instruments and interest bearing investments continental generally uses banks tha t it has classified as core banks on the basis of defined criteria. as a general rule these banks should have at least one investment grade credit rating from one of the global rating agencies. the default risk can therefore be considered very low. the creditworthiness of the core banks  and of other banks with which investments are made loans are granted or derivative instruments are traded in derogation from the core bank principle for operational or regulatory reasons  is continuously monitored. not only the credit ratings but also in particular the premiums for insuring against credit default risks credit default swaps cdss are,,,,,,,,,0.2577440670433605,,,,,,,,,,
98,continental ag    annual report   management report    report on risks and opportunities    monitored provided this information is available. in addition continental sets investment limits for each bank and trad ing limits for derivative instruments. the amount of these limits is based on the creditworthiness of the respective bank. compliance with these  limits is continuously monitored. within the internally defined risk groups the cash and cash equivalents interest bearing investments and positive net fair values of derivative instruments held at banks assigned to a higher risk group range from   million to   million.  risks related to the markets in w hich continental operates  continental could be exposed to material risks in connection with a global financial and economic crisis.  with a  share of consolidated sales the automotive industry  with the exception of the replacement business   is continentals most important customer group. the rema inder of its sales are generated from the replacement or industrial markets mainly in the replacement markets for passenger car and truck tires and to  a lesser extent in the non automotive end markets of the other group sectors.  the automotive markets re covered in the year under review despite the ongoing high level of geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. should this revival not last in the long term or be dampened by a general economic downturn it would likely adversely affect continentals sale s and earnings.  in the year under review continentals five largest oem customers bmw ford mercedes benz stellantis and vw generated approximately  of sales. if one or more of continentals oem customers is lost or terminates a supply contract pre maturely the original investments made by continental to provide such products or outstanding claims against such customers could be wholly or partially lost.  moreover continental generated  of its  total sales in  europe and  in germany alone . by comparison  of continentals total sales in  were generated in north america  in asia pacific and  in other countries. therefore in the event  of an economic downturn in europe particularly in germany for  example continentals busin ess and earnings situation could be  affected more extensively than that of its competitors. furthermore the automotive and tire markets in europe and north america are largely saturated. to minimize this dependence continental is striving to improve its  regional sales balance particularly by generating more sales in emerging markets and especially in asia.  based on a scenario analysis that assumes a  decline in sales volume in  compared with planning assumptions and taking into account measures  required as a result we anticipate a possible decline of around  percentage points in the adjusted ebit margin.  continental operates in a cyclical industry.  with a  share of consolidated sales the automotive industry  with the exception of the rep lacement business   is continentals most important customer group. global production of vehicles and as a result sales to oems are subjected to major fluctuations in some cases. they depend among other things on general economic conditions disposable  income and household consumer spending and preferences which can be affected by a number of factors including fuel costs as well as the availability and cost of consumer financing. as the volume of automotive production fluctuates the demand for contin entals products also fluctuates as oems generally do not commit to purchasing minimum quantities from their suppliers or to fixed prices. it is difficult to predict future developments in the markets continental serves which also makes it harder to esti mate the requirements for production capacity. as continentals business is characterized by high fixed costs it is thus exposed to the risk that fixed costs are not fully covered in the event of falling demand and the resulting underutilization of its fa cilities particularly in automotive. conversely should the markets in which continental operates once again grow faster than anticipated there could be insufficient capacity to meet customer demand. to reduce the impact of the potential risk resulting from this dependence on the automotive industry continental is strengthening its replacement business and industrial business including by means of acquisitions.  continental is exposed to geopolitical risks.  current geopolitical developments such as the  war in ukraine the conflict in the middle east and the ongoing conflict between china and taiwan could have significant effects on continentals sales and procurement markets. these include sanctions and other risks in supply chains as well as unforeseea ble effects on the global economy. continental constantly monitors current developments and derives possible scenarios and necessary measures.  continental is exposed to fluctuations in the prices of raw materials and electronic components as well as the risk of rising logistics costs.  for the automotive group sector higher prices for raw materials and electronic components in particular can result in cost increases . the tires and contitech group sectors mainly use natural and synthetic rubber as well as oi lbased raw materials. the prices for these raw materials and components are exposed to sometimes considerable fluctuations worldwide although the situation on the raw materials markets has eased compared with the previous year. at present continental do es not actively hedge against the risk of  rising prices of electronic components or raw materials by using derivative instruments. in addition increases in logistics costs can occur for example due to the armed conflicts around the red sea and the resulting changes to transportation routes. if the company is not able to compensate for the increased costs or to pass them on to customers these price increases could reduce continentals earnings by   million to   million.,,,,,,,0.3812382849224879,,,,0.3269035584556999,,,,,,,,
99,continental ag    annual report   management report    report on risks and opportunities    continental is expose d to risks associated with additional or higher tariffs.  due to the trend toward protectionism and the increase in trade conflicts around the world continental sees itself at risk from additional or higher tariffs on automobiles and on the products components and raw materials it supplies or purchases. these tariffs could cause demand for continentals products to drop and costs to increase which would have an adverse effect on continentals business and earnings situation.  risks related to continentals  business operations  continental depends on a limited number of key suppliers for certain products.  continental is subject to the potential risk of unavailability of certain raw materials and production materials. although continentals general policy is to source product components from a number of different suppliers single sourcing cannot always be avoided and consequently continental is dependent on certain suppliers in particular with respect to certain products manufactured by automotive as well as in tires and contitech. since continentals procurement logistics are mostly organized on a just intime or just insequence basis supply delays cancellations strikes insufficient quantities or inadequate quality can lead to interruptions in product ion and therefore have a negative impact on continentals business operations in these areas. continental tries to limit these risks by endeavoring to select suppliers carefully and monitor them regularly. however if one of continentals suppliers is unab le to meet its delivery obligations e.g. due to insolvency destruction of production plants as a result of natural disasters or refusal to perform following a change in control or if corresponding deliveries are affected by sanctions due to geopolitica l disputes continental may be unable to source input products from other suppliers on short notice at the required volume. such developments and events can therefore cause delays in the delivery or completion of continental products or projects and could result in continental having to purchase products or services from third parties at higher costs or even to  financially support its own suppliers. furthermore in many cases oem customers have approval rights with respect to the suppliers used by continental which could make it impossible for continental to source input products from other suppliers upon short notice if the relevant oem customer has not already approved other suppliers at an earlier point in time and which could lead to order cancellation s. claims for damages on a considerable scale can also not be ruled out. furthermore continentals reputation among oem customers could suffer with the possible consequence that they select a different supplier.  continental is exposed to information technology risks.  with regard to its business and production processes its products and its internal and external communication continental is highly dependent on centralized and standardized information technology systems and networks. these systems and networks as well as the products themselves are potentially exposed to the risk of various forms of cybercrime as well as damage and disruption that can have a wide range of other causes. in hacker attacks third parties could attempt to gain unauthorized a ccess to confidential information and data that is stored processed or communicated in the systems and networks. in addition data products and systems could be blocked damaged controlled or destroyed as a result of becoming infected with viruses or ma lware.  during a cyberattack that was discovered in august  attackers infiltrated parts of continentals it systems and copied several terabytes of data before the attack could be stopped. continental subsequently received ransom demands from the alleg ed attackers who threatened to publish the copied data. continental did not respond to the demands. the hacker group published a list of the data that it claimed to have in its possession. with the support of external cybersecurity experts continental is  conducting an investigation into the incident and the data affected. rights to information and claims for damages are also being asserted both in and out of court. the number of legal proceedings in connection with this incident is currently still manage able. the possibility that further court proceedings could follow cannot be ruled out. no fines were imposed against continental in the context of this cyber attack. continentals business activities were not affected by the attack at any point and contin ental maintains full control over its it systems.  although continental has taken appropriate precautions to manage the risks associated with system and network disruptions and corresponding attacks a prolonged outage in a computer center or telecommunicat ion network or a comparable incident could result in systems or networks becoming unexpectedly unavailable over an extended period. the measures taken to minimize such risks include technical and organizational precautions such as duplicated data storage and contingency plans as well as suitable training measures that are continuously expanded particularly to raise awareness of the growing threat from cybercrime.  should the precautions taken prove insufficient to adequately protect the systems networks products and information continental could suffer considerable damage and disadvantages as a result of outages or the knowledge and use of its information by third parties.,,,0.3568162116427414,,,0.2535134320427928,0.4083890509434362,0.3485026079156227,0.2580069972992297,,,,,,,,,,
100,continental ag    annual report   management report    report on risks and opportunities    continental is exposed to risks in connection with its pension commitments.  cont inental provides defined benefit pension plans in germany the usa the uk and certain other countries. as at december    the pension obligations amounted to .  million. these existing obligations are financed predominantly through externally invested pension plan assets. in  continental established legally independent trust funds under contractual trust arrangements ctas for the funding of pension obligations of certain subsidiaries in germany. in  continental assumed additional ct as in connection with the acquisition of siemens vdo. as at december    continentals net pension obligations defined benefit obligations less the fair value of plan assets amounted to .  million.  continentals externally invested plan assets are funded by externally managed funds and insurance companies. while continental generally prescribes the investment strategies applied by these funds and takes these into account when selecting external fund managers it does not have any influenc e over their individual investment decisions. the assets are invested in different asset classes including equity fixed income securities real estate and other investment vehicles. the values attributable to the externally invested plan assets are subje ct to fluctuations in the capital markets that are beyond continentals influence. unfavorable developments in the capital markets could result in a substantial coverage shortfall for these pension obligations resulting in a significant increase in contin entals net pension obligations.  any such increase in continentals net pension obligations could adversely affect continentals financial condition due to an increased additional outflow of funds to finance the pension obligations. also continental is ex posed to risks associated with longevity and interest rate changes in connection with its pension commitments as an interest rate decrease could have an adverse effect on continentals liabilities under these pension plans. furthermore certain us based s ubsidiaries of continental have entered into obligations to make contributions to healthcare costs of former employees and retirees. accordingly continental is exposed to the potential risk that these costs may increase in the future.  if the discount rate s used to calculate net pension obligations were to decrease by . percentage points at the end of the year all other things being equal this would lead to a rise in net pension obligations of anywhere from   million to   million which could not be reduced by taking measures to minimize risk. however this would not affect ebit.  continental is exposed to risks associated with warranty and product liability claims.  in its quality strategy continental has defined the framework conditions for all qu alityrelated activities and ascribes the highest priority to quality. however continental is constantly subject to product liability claims and proceedings alleging violations of due care violation of warranty obligations or material defects and claims  arising  from breaches of contract due to recalls or government proceedings. any such lawsuits proceedings and other claims could result in increased costs for continental. moreover defective products could result in loss of sales and loss of customer a nd market acceptance. such risks are insured up to levels considered economically reasonable by continental but its insurance coverage could prove insufficient in individual cases. additionally any defect in one of continentals products in particular t ires and other safety related products could also have a considerable adverse effect on the companys reputation and market perception. this could in turn have a negative impact on continentals sales and income. moreover vehicle manufacturers are increa singly requiring a contribution from their suppliers for potential product liability warranty and recall claims. in addition continental is subject to continuing efforts by its customers to change contract terms and conditions concerning the contribution  to warranty and recall cost. furthermore continental manufactures many products pursuant to oem customer specifications and quality requirements. if the products manufactured and delivered by continental do not meet the requirements stipulated by its oem  customers at the agreed date of delivery production of the relevant products is generally discontinued until the cause of the product defect has been identified and remedied. under certain circumstances this could lead to losses of sales and earnings. f urthermore continentals oem customers could potentially claim damages even if the cause of the defect is remedied at a later point in time. moreover failure to fulfill quality requirements could have an adverse effect on the market acceptance of continentals other products and its market reputation in various market segments.  the quantifiable risks from warranty and product liability claims as at december    taking into account provisions amounted to around   million.  continental is exposed to risks from trade restrictions sanctions and export controls.  due to the global alignment of the economic activity of the continental group there are business risks with respect to embargoes sanctions and export controls. as a global company continen tal also has business relations with customers and partners based in countries that are  or may be in the future  subject to export restrictions embargoes economic sanctions or other forms of trade restrictions. in addition to the fundamental influence  that such restrictions have on the business activity of the continental group  violations of relevant provisions may lead to considerable penalties administrative sanctions damage to the companys reputation as well as claims for damages. continental may also be forced through new trade restrictions to limit or put an end to business activity in certain countries or regions.,,,,,,,,,,,0.400598321927491,,,,,,0.0779657535091788,,
101,continental ag    annual report   management report    report on risks and opportunities    continental could be adversely affected by property loss and business interruption.  fire natural hazards terrorism power f ailures or other disturbances at continentals production facilities or within continentals supply chain  with customers and with suppliers   can result in severe damage and loss. such far reaching negative consequences can also arise from political unrest or instability. due to climate change the probability of natural hazards in particular extreme weather events is expected to continue to rise and the extent of damage to increase. the risks arising from business interruption loss of production or th e financing of facilities are insured up to levels considered economically reasonable by continental but its insurance coverage could prove insufficient in individual cases. furthermore such events could injure or damage individuals third party property or the environment which could among other things lead to considerable financial costs for continental.  continental is exposed to risks in connection with its interest in mc projects b.v.  continental and compagnie financire michelin sas clermont ferrand france michelin each hold a  stake in mc projects b.v. maastricht netherlands a company to which michelin contributed the rights to the uniroyal brand for europe as well as for certain countries outside europe. in turn mc projects b.v. licen sed to continental certain rights to use the uniroyal brand on or in connection with tires in europe and elsewhere. under the terms of the agreement concluded in this connection both the agreement and the uniroyal license can be terminated if a major comp etitor in the tire business acquires more than  of the voting rights of continental ag or of its tire business. furthermore in this case michelin also has the right to acquire a majority in mc projects b.v. and to have mc projects b.v. increase its min ority stake in the manufacturing company continental barum s.r.o. otrokovice czechia  one of continentals largest tire plants in europe   to . these events could have an adverse effect on the business and earnings position of continentals tires gro up sector.  legal tax and environmental risks  continental could be threatened with fines and claims for damages for alleged or actual unlawful behavior.  despite the compliance management system in place at continental the global nature of the continental  groups business activities means there is a possibility that unlawful behavior e.g. corruption fraud violations of antitrust and competition law money laundering could occur in individual cases or that continental could be  accused of unlawful behav ior. this alleged or actual unlawful behavior could lead to fines or claims for damages. significant proceedings in this context are outlined below.  in may  the brazilian competition authorities opened investigations against continentals brazilian subsidiary continental brasil industria automotiva ltda. guarulhos brazil cbia following a complaint of anticompetitive behavior in the area of commercialization of tachographs. on august   the brazilian antitrust authorities determined an in vitation to cartel and imposed a fine of brl   million around .  million on cbia which was then reduced to brl .  million around .  million. cbia denies the accusation that it has infringed brazilian antitrust law. although the court of first instance appealed to by cbia upheld the decision on cbias further appeal the next higher court annulled this decision and remanded the matter. in february   the court of first instance rendered a verdict against cbia and lifted the ban on the enforcement of the financial penalty against cbia at that time an amount of brl .  million around .  million. cbia filed a motion for clarification requesting that the preliminary injunction against enforcement remain in full force up until a final and unappealable ruling is made. this motion was denied and cbia filed an appeal against this decision. in case an infringement of brazilian  antitrust law is found third parties may in addition claim damages from cbia.  on october    south africa n antitrust authorities received a complaint from a third party accusing several south african tire manufacturers of alleged antitrust behavior including continental tyre south africa pty. ltd. port elizabeth south africa ctsa a subsidiary of conti nental. on august    the south african antitrust authorities came to the conclusion that ctsa had violated south african antitrust law and referred the matter to the responsible antitrust court for a decision. ctsa denies the allegation of infringem ents of south african antitrust law. however the tribunal could impose a fine of up to  of ctsas sales. in addition third parties may also claim damages from ctsa in case of an infringement of south african competition law.  as a result of

103,continental ag    annual report   management report    report on risks and opportunities    there is a risk that continental could infringe on the industrial property rights of third parties. there is a risk that continental could infringe on the industrial property rights of third parties since its competitors suppliers and customers also submit a large number of inventions for industrial property protection. it is not always possible to determine with certainty whether there are effective and enforceable third party industrial property rights to certain processes method s or applications. therefore third parties could assert claims including illegitimate ones of alleged infringements of industrial property rights against continental. as a result continental could be required to cease manufacturing using or marketing the relevant technologies or products in certain countries or be forced to make changes to manufacturing processes andor products. in addition continental could be liable to pay compensation for infringements or could be forced to purchase licenses to c ontinue using technology from third parties.  continental for example supplies telecommunication modules that transmit vehicle data enable voice and internet functionality and are compatible with cellular communication standards. in this respect there is a risk that continental or its suppliers may be denied their own direct license to use patents relating to these standards standard essential patents especially in the field of telecommunications standards such as g g or g and that continental m ay become dependent on licenses and the conditions under which they are granted to customers. in addition continental is subject to efforts by its customers to change contract terms and conditions concerning the participation in disputes regarding alleged  infringements of intellectual property rights. continental has formed provisions to cover the risks in this regard. in accordance with ias . and gas . no further disclosures will be made so as not to adversely affect the companys interests.  con tinental could become subject to additional burdensome environmental or safety regulations and new regulations could adversely affect demand for the companys products and services.  as a corporation that operates worldwide continental must observe a large number of different regulatory systems in numerous countries that change frequently and are continuously evolving and becoming more stringent particularly with respect to the environment chemicals and hazardous materials as well as health regulations. this also applies to air water and soil pollution regulations and to waste legislation all of which have recently become more stringent through new laws particularly in the european union and the usa. continental could be affected in particular b y greater restrictions on the use of per  and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas. moreover continentals locations and operations necessitate various permits and the requirements specified therein must be complied with. in the past adjusting to new requirements has necessitated investments and continental assumes that further investments in this regard will be required in the future.  continental is exposed to risks from legal disputes.  companies from the continental group are involved in a number  of le gal and arbitration proceedings and could become involved in other such proceedings in the future. these proceedings could involve substantial claims for damages or payments particularly in the usa. for more information on legal disputes see note  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  continental could be unsuccessful in adequately protecting its intellectual property and technical expertise.  continentals products and services are highly dependent upon its technological know how and t he scope and limitations of its proprietary rights therein. continental has obtained or applied for a large number of patents and other industrial property rights that are of considerable importance to its business. the process of obtaining patent protecti on can be lengthy and expensive. furthermore patents may not be granted on currently pending or future applications or may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide continental with meaningful protection or commercial advantage. in addition altho ugh there is a presumption that patents are valid this does not necessarily mean that the patent concerned is effective  or that possible patent claims can be enforced to the degree necessary or desired.  a major part of continentals know how and trade se crets is not  patented or cannot be protected through industrial property rights. consequently there is a risk that certain parts of continentals know how and trade secrets could be transferred to collaboration partners customers and suppliers including continentals machinery suppliers or plant vendors. this poses a risk that competitors will copy continentals know how without incurring any expenses of their own. moreover continental has concluded a number of license cross license collaboration and  development agreements with its customers competitors and other third parties under which continental is granted rights to industrial property andor know how of such third parties. it is possible that license agreements could be terminated under certain  circumstances in the event  of the licensing partners insolvency or bankruptcy andor in the event of a change of control in either party leaving continental with reduced access to intellectual property rights to commercialize its own technologies.,,,0.3603345658159095,0.3659634318610039,,0.2899865836659934,0.4028699037987808,0.3478388962355336,,0.3342733212135138,,0.1515590211926227,0.2712310192488972,0.2737155088922658,0.1841631767125207,,,,0.305234204954704
104,continental ag    annual report   management report    report on risks and opportunities    continental could be exposed to tax risks in connection with previous assessment periods.  continental  ag and its subsidiaries operate worldwide and are continuously audited by local tax authorities. tax estimates made for the financial statements may differ from how these are interpreted by the tax authorities for example because of changes to tax legislation and the development of case law. tax risks arise in particular from the valuation of cross border intercompany deliveries and  services transfer pric es. through organizational measures such as monitoring transfer prices and where necessary carrying out  bilateral appeals procedures continental  ag monitors and controls the development of taxation risks and their impact on the consolidated financial s tatements. tax processes are continuously adapted to new tax laws and changes to case law.  during the reporting period italian tax authorities opened criminal tax investigations into three italian companies of the continental group. the investigations rel ate to a possible failure by the units concerned to comply with reporting and declaration requirements visvis the italian tax authorities. financial charges in the form of back taxes penalties and fines as well as interest payments are not implausible.  due to the complexity of the facts presented by the italian authorities and the early stage of the investigations it is not possible to reliably estimate the possible financial charges.,,,,,,,0.3832531018995442,,,,,,,,0.2078364069348255,,,,
105,continental ag    annual report   management report    report on risks and opportunities    material opportunities unless the emphasis is placed on a specific group sector the  opportunities apply to all group sectors.  there are opportunities for continental if the economy performs better than anticipated.  if the economy in our major sales regions develops better than  we have anticipated we expect that demand for vehicles replacement tires and industrial products will also develop better than we have anticipated. due to the increased demand for continentals products among vehicle manufacturers and industrial clients  and in the replacement business that would be expected as a consequence our sales could rise more significantly than expected and there could be positive effects with regard to fixed cost coverage. particular importance is attached to the european market due to the high share of sales that continental generates in this region .  there are opportunities for continental if prices fall on the raw materials markets relevant to us.  continentals earnings situation is affected to a significant extent  by th e cost of raw materials electronic components logistics and energy. for automotive this particularly relates to the cost of electronic components as well as metals and plastics. the earnings situation of tires and contitech is significantly impacted by the cost of oil and of natural and synthetic rubber. if prices for natural and synthetic rubber in particular decline this could have a positive impact on continentals earnings provided sales prices for rubber products remain stable.  the trend toward automated and autonomous driving presents continental with opportunities.  the trend from assisted driving to automated and autonomous driving is set to continue. several vehicle manufacturers plan to offer new models with partially automated level  functions over the next few years. a key requirement for partially automated driving is that vehicles be equipped with sensors. to date between two and seven sensors for assisted driving have been installed per vehicle depending on their equipment fea tures. even for partially automated driving considerably more and also higher quality radar camera and lidar sensors are required depending on the scope of the functionality. since continental is one of the leading providers of advanced driver assistanc e systems the increasing volume of sensors electronic control units and new software could result  in considerable sales and earnings opportunities.  there are opportunities for continental from strategic partnerships particularly in the automotive group  sector.  continental is increasingly focusing on strategic partnerships in order to shape the transformation in the automotive sector as efficiently as possible. the latest examples of this are the strategic partnerships with the technology companies ambar ella and aurora. such partnerships allow the companies involved to contribute their expertise and optimize research and development costs for example. in addition the strengths of each company can help ensure a higher level of innovation and agility when  launching products. cost optimization and an improved competitive position   thanks to faster time to market for example  present continental with  opportunities.  the digitalization of vehicles and the services generated as a result present continental  with opportunities.  the massive amounts of data generated by driver assistance systems and driver information systems as well as the immediate processing of this data in vehicles require switching the vehicle architecture to the most cutting edge high performance computers.  this  together with the new software solutions required for this purpose  results in substantial growth potential for continental with positive effects on its future sales and attainable margins. furthermore the increasing digitaliz ation of our products gives us the opportunity to offer our customers software based services and regular software updates in addition to the product itself and to open up new markets for mobility services. the implementation  of generative ai can also lead to growth opportunities and faster time to market for new continental products e.g. partnership  with google cloud see the research and development section.  innovations for vehicle interiors present continental with opportunities.  for optimum interac tion between the driver and the vehicle more and more new products are being used in car manufacturing. for the user experience of the future continental has developed countless innovations such as curved digital d displays and temporarily hidden displa ys. with customer specific solutions for interior sensor technology continental is also increasing safety and ease of use within the vehicle. since intelligent concepts for new experiences  in the vehicle interior are becoming more and more important for car buyers and continental is one of the leading providers of these increasing demand among car manufacturers could result in considerable sales and earnings opportunities.  the tire business presents continental with opportunities.  continental intends to  further increase its market share in the growth markets of asia and north america in particular. in the passenger car tire segment the global business with tires for electric mobility and ultra high performance tires is to be systematically  expanded fur ther. the truck and bus tire business is to be further developed in all regions through the conti fleet services. continentals specialty tire business which includes not only two wheel and racing tires but also tires for a variety of industrial applications is expected to grow further as well. smart digital tire solutions and ambitious sustainability goals will also make a significant contribution to market success and differentiation in the future. the market launch of the new ultracontact nxt prod uction tire and the presentation of the conti cityplus tire concept are important milestones see the research and development section. in the area of service based digital solutions the tires group sector of continental aims to become the leading suppli er worldwide by . if continental succeeds in increasing its market share in high growth segments and in digital solutions and services even more than planned this  is likely to have positive effects on its sales and earnings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.2356187378273103,,,,,,
106,continental ag    annual report   management report    report on risks and opportunities    digitalization and sustainability in the industrial business present continental with opportunities.  the growth potential results primarily from the increasing demand for sustainable as well as digital and intelligent solutions in the industrial business. in this regard the contitech group sector draws on its long standing and detailed knowledge of the industry and materials to open up new business opportunities. various materials are thus combined with electronic components and individual services. continental also shows fo r example how future mobile interiors might look e.g. space d design concept see the research and development section. if these new products become established more quickly than planned this would create corresponding sales and earnings opportunities for continental.  there are opportunities for continental from changes in the legal framework.  legal regulations with the aim of further improving traffic safety provide an opportunity for a rise in demand for continentals pro ducts. based on our broad product portfolio for active vehicle safety we have developed more advanced safety systems over the past years. further volume growth is expected as a result of more stringent requirements in various regional safety tests since an increasing number of safety systems have been recognized as having achieved the very highest level of safety. in addition more and more legal requirements in individual countries are being expanded to include active safety systems.statement on overall risk and opportunities situationin the opinion of the executive board the overall risk situation of the continental group has not changed significantly in the past  fiscal year.  it remains to be seen to w hat extent and for how long current geopolitical events the ongoing uncertainty in supply chains and inflation will continue to affect the automotive industry and the macroeconomic situation.  however the analysis for the year under review did not reveal any risks either at the end of the reporting period or at the time the annual financial statements were prepared that individually or collectively pose a threat to the company or the continental group as a going concern. in the opinion of the executive b oard there are also no discernible risks to the continental group as a going concern in the foreseeable future.  considering the material opportunities the overall risk assessment for the continental group presents a reasonable risk and opportunities situ ation to which our risk containment measures and our corporate strategy have been aligned accordingly.,,0.2791135072152705,0.3596996786610154,0.324694621792871,,0.2905414977112854,,0.3170356649902585,,,,,0.317020319424388,,,,,,0.2963873511169371

continental group for the new fiscal year. these include sales and the adjusted ebit margin for the continental group and for the automotive tires contitech and contract manufacturing group secto rs. in addition we provide information on the assessment of important factors influencing earnings before interest and tax ebit. these include the expected negative or positive effect of the estimated development of material prices and other cost factor s for the current year the expected development of special effects and the amount of amortization from purchase price allocations. we thus allow the continental groups expected ebit to be estimated.  furthermore we give an assessment of the development of interest income and expenses as well as the tax rate for the continental group which in turn allows the continental groups expected net income to be estimated. we also publish a forecast of the capital expenditures planned for the current year and the  adjusted free cash flow. our forecast is based on our expectations regarding the most important production and sales markets in the new fiscal year.  we publish our forecast as part of our annual press conference and the publication of our annual report. it is continually reviewed over the course of the fiscal year. possible changes to the forecast are described at the latest in the report for the respective quarter.  comparison of the past fiscal year against forecast  our forecast for fiscal  which we published in march   was based on a continued recovery in the global production of passenger cars and light

subsequently as eu audit regulation  in compliance with german generally accepted standards for financial statement  audits promulgated by the institute of public auditors in germany institut der

our audit opinion thereon we do not provide a  separate audit opinion on these matters.  in our view the matters of most significance in our audit were as follows   recoverabil ity of goodwill and non current assets with finite useful lives   accounting treatment of deferred taxes   our presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in each case as follows   matter and issue   audit

116,continental ag    annual report   consolidated financial statements    independent auditors report    hereinafter we present the key audit matters  recoverability of goodwill and non current assets with finite useful lives   goodwill amounting in total to  . million . of total  assets or . of total equity and non current assets with finite useful lives amounting in total to  . million . of total assets or . of total equity are reported  in the companys consolidated financial statements . while goodwill must be tested for impairment once a year or when there are indications of impairment non current assets with finite useful lives only have to be tested for impairment if there are indication s that they may be impaired triggering events. the impairment test is performed at the level of the cash generating units. the carrying amount of the relevant cash generating units where applicable including goodwill is compared with the corresponding recoverable amount in the context of the impairment test. the recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. the company generally determines the recoverable amount using the value in use. the present value of t he future cash flows from the respective cash generating units normally serves as the basis of valuation. present values are calculated using discounted cash flow models. for this purpose the long term planning for the cash generating units adopted by the executive directors forms the starting point which is extrapolated based on assumptions about long term rates of growth. expectations relating to future market developments and assumptions about the development of macroeconomic factors which are currentl y subject to increased uncertainties are also taken into account. the discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital for the respective cash generating unit. if the value in use falls below the carrying amount of the cash generating unit it is assessed whether the fair values less costs of disposal of the assets exceed their carrying amounts. if not the need for write downs shall be based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. the impairment test determined that no write downs were necessary.  the outcome of this valuation is dependent to a large extent on the estimates made by the executive directors with respect to the future cash flows from the respective cash generating units the discount rate used the rate o f growth and other assumptions and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. against this background and due to the complex nature of the valuation this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.   as part of our audit we assessed the methodology used for the purposes of performing the impairment test among other things with the assistance of our internal specialists from valuation modeling  analytics. after matching the future cash inflows used for the calculation against the long term planning for the cash generating units adopted by the executive directors we assessed the appropriateness of the calculation in particular by reconciling it with general and sector specific market expectations. i n addition we assessed the appropriate consideration of the costs of group functions. in the knowledge that even relatively small changes in the discount rate applied can have a material impact on the value of the entity calculated in this way we focused  our testing in particular on the parameters used to determine the discount rate applied and assessed the calculation model. in order to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the projections we evaluated the sensitivity analyses performed by the company on  the effect of potential changes in revenue the discount rate and the long term rate of growth on the recoverable amount. if the value in use fell below the carrying amount of the cash generating unit we assessed whether the fair values less costs of dis posal of the assets still correctly cover ed their carrying amounts.   in addition we assessed whether the disclosures in the notes  relating to the recoverability of goodwill were appropriate and complete.    overall the valuation parameters and assumptions used by the executive directors are in line with our expectations and are also within the ranges considered by us to be reasonable.   the companys disclosures on goodwill and on non current assets with finite useful lives are contained in notes    and   of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  accounting treatment of deferred taxes   deferred tax assets amounting to  . million . of total assets or . of total equity after netting are reported  in the companys consolidated finan cial statements  of which  . million relates to tax loss carryforwards. deferred tax assets amounting to . million were recognized before netting with matching deferred tax liabilities. these items were recognized to the extent that the executiv e directors consider it probable that taxable profit will be available in the foreseeable future which will enable the deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses to be utilized. for this purpose insofar as sufficient deferred tax liabilities a re not available future taxable profits are projected on  the basis of the business plan adopted by the executive directors. no deferred tax assets were recognized in respect of deductible temporary differences eligible tax credits and unused tax losses amounting in total to . million since it is not probable that they will be utilized for tax purposes by means of offset against taxable profits.    in our view the accounting treatment of deferred taxes was of particular significance in the context of our audit as it depends  to a large extent on the estimates and assumptions made by  the executive directors and is therefore subject to uncertainties . as part of our audit of the recoverability of deferred tax assets and with the assistance of our specialists from tax reporting  strategy we assessed among other things the internal processes and controls for recording tax matters as well as the meth odology used for the determination accounting treatment and measurement of deferred taxes. we also assessed the recoverability  of the deferred tax assets relating to deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses on the basis of internal forecast s of the company s and its subsidiaries  future earnings situation for tax purposes and the appropriateness of the underlying estimates and assumptions. based on our audit procedures we were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates and assumptions ma de by the executive directors are substantiated and sufficiently documented

executive directors as well as to issue an auditor s report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements on the consolidated management report  and on the non financial statement.  reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with section  hgb  and the eu audit regulation and in compliance with german generally accepted standards for financial statement audits promulgated by the  idw will always detect a material misstatement. misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if individually or in the aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this consolidated management report . we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  we also   identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in  the consolidated financial statements and in  the consolidated management report  whether due to fraud or error design and perform  audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting fro m error as fraud may involve collusion forgery intentional omissions misrepresentations or the override of internal controls.   obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements  and measures systems relevant to the audit of the consolidated management report and the non financial statement included in the consolidated management report  in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.   evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures .  conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors  use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group s ability to continue as a going concern. if we conclude that a material uncertainty exists we are required to draw attention in the auditor s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the consolidated mana gement report  or if such disclosures are inadequate to modify our respective audit opinions. our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor s report. however future events or conditions may cause the group to ceas e to be able to continue as a going concern.   evaluate the overall presentation structure and content of the consolidated financial statements including the disclosures and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions  and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets liabilities financial position and financial performance of the group in compliance with ifrss as adopted by the eu and the additional requirements  of german commercial law pursuant to section e   hgb .  obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the

statements its conformity with german law and the view of the group s position it provides.   perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the

135,continental ag    annual report   consolidated financial statements    notes to the consolidated financial statements    . general information and accounting principles  continental aktiengesellschaft continental ag whose registered office is continental plaza  hanover germany is the parent company of the continental group and a listed stock corporation. it is entered in the commercial register of the hanover local court amtsgericht  under hr b . the continental group is a supplier to the automotive industry with worldwide operations. the areas of business and main activities in which the continental group is engaged are described in more detail in the segment reporting section. the consolidated financial statements of continental ag for fiscal  were prepared by resolution of the executive board of february   and will be submitted to and published in the german federal gazette bundesanzeiger . conti nental ag is  included in the consolidated financial statements of ina holding schaeffler gmbh  co. kg herzogenaurach germany which are published in the german federal gazette.  the consolidated financial statements of continental ag as at december   have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs as adopted by the european union pursuant to eu regulation ec no.  in conjunction with section e  of the german commercial code handelsgesetzb uch  hgb . the term ifrs also includes the international accounting standards ias the interpretations issued by the international financial reporting standards interpretations committee or its predecessor the international financial reporting interpret ations committee ifric and those of the former standing interpretations committee sic. all international financial reporting standards mandatory for fiscal  have been applied subject to endorsement by the european union.  the consolidated financi al statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost with the exception of certain financial assets and liabilities including derivative instruments which are measured at fair value assets held for sale which are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell or costs to distribute and defined benefit pension plans for which the plan assets are measured at fair value.  the annual financial statements of companies included in the  continental group have been prepared using uniform accounting policies in accordance with ifrs  consolidated financial statements . the reporting date for the individual financial statements  of companies included in the continental group is the same as  the reporting date for the consolidated financial statements.  the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in euros. unless otherwise stated all amounts are shown in millions of euros  millions. please note that differences may arise as a result of the use of r ounded amounts and percentages.  in order to increase transparency continental changed how income and expenses are presented in connection with specific warranties restructuring measures severance payments as well as impairment and reversal of impairment losses on intangible assets and property plant and equipment in the reporting year. previously these items were reported under other income and other expenses a s of fiscal  they are assigned to the respective functional areas. this retrospective adjustment due to an amendment of the accounting policies in accordance with ias  accounting policies changes in accounting estimates and errors  led to a . million increase in cost of sales a . million increase in selling and logistics expenses and a . million increase in administrative  expenses for the period from january   to december  . at the same time research and development expen ses decreased by . million other income by . million and other expenses by . million.  in addition the presentation of specific expenses primarily personnel expenses incurred in connection with the provision of development services to exter nal customers was adjusted in the automotive segment. previously these expenses were reported under research and development expenses now they are reported under cost of sales. the adjustment led to a retrospective reduction in research and development expenses of . million while simultaneously increasing cost of sales by the same amount for the period from january   to december  .  in the tires segment the reporting of personnel expenses incurred in connection with activities in the w orkshops of tire companies was adjusted in the reporting year. previously these expenses were reported under selling and logistics expenses now they are reported under cost of sales. the adjustment led to a retrospective reduction in selling and logistics expenses of . million while simultaneously increasing cost of sales by the same amount for the period from january   to december  .  companies consolidated  all major subsidiaries that continental ag controls in accordance with the prov isions of ifrs  have been included in the consolidated financial statements and are fully consolidated. to meet this definition continental ag must have the decision making power to control the relevant activities and a right to variable returns from the associated company. furthermore it must be able to use its  decision making power to determine the amount of these returns. the companies consolidated may therefore also include companies that are controlled by continental ag irrespective of the share o f voting rights by way of other substantial rights such as contractual agreements as is the case with structured units included in the consolidated financial statements.  the consolidation of subsidiaries is based on the acquisition method by offsetting t he acquisition cost against the proportion of net assets attributed to the parent company at fair value at the acquisition date. intangible assets not previously recognized in the separate  financial statements of the acquired company are carried at fair value. intangible assets identified in the course of a business combination  including for example brand names patents technology customer relationships and order backlogs  are recognized separately at the acquisition date only if the requirements un der ias  intangible assets for an intangible asset are met. measurement at the acquisition date is usually provisional only. increases or reductions of assets and liabilities that become necessary

138,continental ag    annual report   consolidated financial statements    notes to the consolidated financial statements    description of sales revenue in industrial and replacement business  the type of performance obligations to customers in industrial and replacement business relates to the replacement tire and retail bus iness of the tires segment the industrial and retail business of the contitech segment and the replacement parts and retail business of the automotive and contract manufacturing segments please refer to the information provided on the group sectors in t he structure of the continental group section of the consolidated management report. invoices are generally prepared once a month while the payment terms for most of the sales average  days and differ mostly depending on the region andor product group.  payments are made by bank transfer in the vast majority of cases with the  exception of business with end customers and consumers who often pay in cash or by card. no significant discounts on the invoice amount are granted however customer bonuses and  other price reductions are included in the transaction price as variable price components in line with expectations. the customers do not usually make any significant advance payments. revenue is recognized at the point in time when control is transferred  to the customer  taking into account the agreed incoterms. there are no significant obligations from the right of customers to return products or from reimbursements to customers or similar obligations or from warranty commitments that include a service component.  description of revenue in other business activities  revenue in other business activities is included in the sales of the automotive original equipment business in the sales of the industrial and replacement business and in other revenues. on the one hand services are provided and on the other project b usiness is conducted in which developments for customers are made goods produced or services provided over a medium term or longer period. for this revenue there are no significant obligations from the right of customers to return products or from reimb ursements to customers or similar obligations or from warranty commitments that include a service component.  the largest component of this revenue relates to revenue from  research and development which is recognized at a point in time either when the entire development is completed or when identifiable milestones within a development are reached. invoices are generally prepared after completion of a milestone or an entire development and acceptance by the customer. payments are made by bank transfer in most cases. no significant discounts on the invoice amount are granted. the customers do not usually make any significant advance payments.  in addition services that are performed alongside the main business also lead to revenue recognition over time th ough in smaller amounts. both input  and output based measurement methods are used and sales are measured either based on the hours or days worked or the costs incurred input or based on the services rendered output. invoices are generally prepared at  least once a month  and payments are made by bank transfer in most cases. no significant discounts on the invoice amount are granted. the customers do not usually make any significant advance payments.  in addition project business is conducted in which  generally customer specific goods or services are produced or provided for customers over a medium term or longer period. revenue from this is likewise recognized over time and sales are mostly measured using input based measurement methods taking accoun t of the costs incurred. invoices are generally issued as contractually agreed. advance payments averaging  are usually made by the customers before the start of a project. payments are made by bank transfer in most cases. no significant discounts on th e invoice amount are granted.  contract assets and contract liabilities  contract assets primarily arise in the project business from customer specific goods or services for customers but are only of  minor significance in the continental group. contract a ssets must be recognized because the goods or services are provided over a medium term or longer period in which goods or services have already been provided by continental but there is not yet an unconditional right against the customer i.e. a receivable. the right   or part of the right  to consideration from the customer is often only unconditional once the provision of the services has been completed and can then be recognized as a receivable and invoiced in full. the associated payments are generally  made on the basis of actual invoicing. the recognition of receivables and the receipt of payments reduce the associated contract assets.  contract liabilities include mainly advance payments by customers for deliveries of goods and for services to be perf ormed. in the case of these advance payments by customers for deliveries of goods and for services to be performed the customer has already paid the consideration  or part of the consideration   but continental has generally not yet satisfied its perform ance obligation or has done so only to a limited extent. the provision of the corresponding services to the customers by continental reduces the level of the associated contract liabilities.  research and development expenses  research and development expen ses comprise expenditure on research and development and expenses for customer specific applications prototypes and testing. where refunds from customers for research and development expenses are agreed these costs are recognized in inventories until con trol is transferred. once control is transferred the refund amounts are stated under other income. in addition the expenses are reduced by the amount relating to the application of research results from the development of new or substantially improved pr oducts if the related activity fulfills the recognition criteria for internally generated intangible assets set out in ias  intangible assets . this portion of the expenses is capitalized as an asset and amortized over a period of three to seven years from the date that the developed products become marketable. however expenses for customer specific applications pre production prototypes or tests for products already being marketed do not qualify as development expenditure which may be recognize d as an intangible asset. furthermore expenses incurred directly in connection with the launch of new production operations and plants are recognized directly in profit or loss.,0.2388391163539493,0.3404042155169746,0.4045606626809845,0.3852702655840795,0.3133094652175619,0.3496960339093468,0.5274898039598,0.4512558919666005,0.3403913934815212,0.2602037597765994,0.3832627873529519,0.2327151718748581,0.2834229728385612,0.3629400575040123,0.2071011401588794,0.1759915363522183,0.1059402111382254,0.1481439103701378,0.4265384532672185
139,continental ag    annual report   consolidated financial statements    notes to the consolidated financial statements    new developments for the original equipment business are not marketable unti l continental ag has been nominated as the supplier for the particular vehicle platform or model and furthermore has successfully fulfilled pre production release stages. moreover these release stages serve as the prerequisite to demonstrate the technic al feasibility of the product especially given the high demands imposed on safety and comfort technology. accordingly  development costs are recognized as an asset only as at the date of nomination as supplier and upon fulfillment of a specific pre  prod uction release stage. the development is considered to be completed once the final approval for the unlimited production is granted. only very few development projects fulfill the recognition criteria.  although suppliers are nominated by original equipment  manufacturers with the general obligation to supply products over the entire life of the particular model or platform these supply agreements constitute neither long term contracts nor firm commitments in particular because the original equipment manufa cturers make no commitments in regard to purchase quantities. for this reason all pre production expenses   with the exception of the capitalized development costs as previously described   are recognized immediately in profit or loss.  product related exp enses  costs for advertising sales promotion and other sales related items are expensed as incurred. provisions are recognized for possible warranty claims on sold products on the basis of past experience as well as legal and contractual terms. additional  provisions are recognized for specific known cases.  financial result and investment income  interest income and expenses are recognized for the period to which they relate.  dividends are recognized in profit or loss if legal entitlement to payment of the  dividend is established the economic benefit associated with the dividend is likely to be received and the dividend amount can be measured reliably.  earnings per share  basic earnings per share are calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of shares issued. treasury stock is deducted for the period it is held. diluted earnings per share also include shares from the potential exercise of option or conversion rights. the corresponding expenses that would no longer be incurred after the convers ion or exchange are eliminated.  statement of financial position classification  assets and liabilities are reported as non current assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position if they have a remaining term of over one year and conversely as current assets and liabilities if the remaining term is shorter. liabilities are treated as current if there is no unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least  months after the end of the reporting period. pension provisions  provisions for other post employment benefits and other employee benefits as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities are accounted for as non current. if assets and liabilities have both current and non current portions the amounts are classified separately and shown as current and non current assets or liabilities.  goodwill  goodwill corresponds to the difference between the acquisition cost and the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities of the business combination. goodwill is not subjec t to amortization it is tested for impairment at least annually and if necessary impaired.  the details of the annual impairment test are described under  impairment in this note. once an impairment loss has been  recognized on goodwill it is not reve rsed in subsequent periods.  intangible assets  purchased intangible assets are carried at acquisition costs and internally generated intangible assets at their production costs provided that the conditions for recognition of an internally generated intangi ble asset are met in accordance with ias  intangible assets. if intangible assets have finite useful lives they are amortized on a straight line basis over a useful life of three to eight years in general. intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  are tested at least annually for impairment and if necessary impaired.  the details of the annual impairment test are described under  impairment in this note.  property plant and equipment  property plant and equipment is measured at cost less straigh tline depreciation. if necessary additional impairment is recognized on the affected items.  production cost consists of the direct costs and attributable material and manufacturing overheads including depreciation.  under certain conditions portions of the borrowing costs are capitalized as part of the acquisition cost. this also applies to finance leases and investment property.  as soon as an asset is available for its intended use subsequent cost is capitalized only to the extent the relat ed modification changes the function of the asset or increases its economic value and the cost can be clearly identified. all other subsequent expenditure is recognized as current maintenance expense.  property plant and equipment is broken down into the l owest level of the components that have significantly different useful lives and to the extent integrated in other assets when they are likely to be replaced or overhauled during the overall life of the related main asset. maintenance and repair costs ar e recognized in profit or loss as incurred. the continental group has no property plant or equipment that by the nature of its operation and deployment can be repaired and serviced only in intervals over several years. the useful lives are up to  years for buildings and land improvements up to  years for technical equipment and machinery and up to  years for operating and office equipment.,,0.3166984149178575,0.3644605171440235,0.3151657421710884,,0.3342010415285742,0.4266831250537167,0.4028449827848674,0.2731725238138973,0.2528184354228622,,0.15907077045506,0.2382351204312722,0.2738550923174531,,0.1720963757621512,,,0.2981997091173559
140,continental ag    annual report   consolidated financial statements    notes to the consolidated financial statements    when assets are sold closed down or scrapped the difference between the net proceeds and the net carrying  amount of the assets is recognized as gain or loss in other income or expense respectively.  government grants  government grants are reported if there is reasonable assurance that the conditions in place in connection with the grants will be fulfilled and that the grants will be awarded.  monetary government grants and government subsidies that are directly attributable to depreciable fixed assets are deducted from the procurement and manufacturing costs of the assets in question. all other mon etary grants and subsidies are recognized as income in line with planning and are presented alongside the corresponding expenses. non monetary government grants are recognized at fair value.  investment property  land and buildings held for the purpose of ge nerating rental income instead of production or administrative purposes are carried at depreciated cost. depreciation is charged on a straight line basis over the useful lives which correspond to those for real estate in use by the company.  leases  a contr act is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. a lessee shall recognize a right ofuse asset and a corresponding lease liability which represents  the lessees obligation to make lease payments.  the lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments not yet made. it is recognized under indebtedness. discounting is determined using the incremental borrowing rates as the interest rates underlying the leases often cannot be determined regularly. the right ofuseasset recognized by the lessee is measured at cost. this amount comprises the corresponding lease liability and prepaid lease payments taking into account any lease incentives received. it is recognized in property plant and equipment. depreciation is charged on a straight line basis. the lease liability is subsequently measured according to the effective interest method. the resulting interest expense is recognized in the financial result.  continental utilizes the exemptions for short term leases and for leases in which the underlying asset is of low value.  continental leases property plant and equipment especially buildings.  as lessor continental classifies leases as operating leases or finance leases. for this classification continental considers whether the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset. if this is the case it is a finance lease otherwise it  is an operating lease.  if continental acts as an intermediate lessor the interests arising from the head lease and sublease are accounted for separately. the sublease is measured based on the value of the right ofuse asset resulting from the head lease and not based on the underlying asset. if the head lease is a short term lease for which the continental group applies the exemption provision it classifies the sublease as an operating lease.  the continental group applies ifrs  revenue from contracts with customers  when allocating the consideration in the contract to each lease and non lease component.  impairment  the continental group immediately reviews intangible assets and property plant and equipment investment property and goodwill as soon as t here is an indication of impairment triggering event. impairment is assessed by comparing the carrying amount with the recoverable amount. the recoverable amount is the higher  of the fair value less cost of disposal and the present value of the expected  future cash flows from the continued use of the asset value in use. if the carrying amount is higher than the recoverable amount the difference is recognized as impairment. if the indications for the prior recognition of impairment no longer apply the  impairment losses are reversed for intangible assets property plant and equipment and investment property.  capitalized goodwill is generally tested for impairment once a year as at november  at the level of cash generating units cgus. cgus are unit s that come below the segments and are the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. this represents the level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. the impairment test is performed by comparing the carrying amount of the cgu including its goodwill and the recoverable amount of this cgu. the recoverable amount in this case is the value in use calculated on the basis of d iscounted cash flows before interest and tax. impairment is recognized to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount for a cgu. if the reasons for this cease to apply in the future impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.,0.29514128533474,0.2893002285867409,0.3213703605352179,0.3754367270667458,0.3379550306422095,0.3897684043818195,0.4017054419277333,0.365839303566207,0.3249339008180188,0.3157228193940274,0.3842880939572911,0.4260811706440784,,0.3030577963300044,0.3124173993391981,0.1845616138442025,0.1033836039265948,0.1722089399666395,0.3294836230713815
141,continental ag    annual report   consolidated financial statements    notes to the consolidated financial statements    the e xpected cash flows of the cgus are derived from long term planning that usually covers the next five years and is approved by management. for the autonomous mobility cgu expected cash flow data is derived from its long term planning that covers the next e ight years. the plans are based in particular on assumptions regarding macroeconomic developments as well as trends in sales prices raw material prices and exchange rates derived in part from external sources. in addition to these current market forecast s past developments and experience are also taken into account. furthermore continentals internal co shadow price is also taken into  account in the assumptions for further details on its calculation please refer to the consolidated management report . for the perpetuity beyond the period of five years the cash flow is extrapolated using the expected long term growth rates for the individual cgus.  the main assumptions when calculating the value in use of a cgu are the free cash flows the discount rate and its parameters and the long term growth rate.  annual impairment testing was performed on the basis of the bottomup business plan for the next five years approved by management in the period under review. the cash flows of the cgus of th e automotive segment were discounted with an interest rate before tax of . py . those of the tires segment with an interest rate of . py . those of the contitech segment with an interest rate of . py . and those of the contract manufacturing segment with an interest rate of . py .. this pre tax wacc is based on the capital structure of the respective relevant peer group on average over the last five years. the riskfree interest rate is . py . and the market risk premium . py .. borrowing costs correspond to the interest rate on industrial bonds with the average rating derived via the peer group.  for the annual impairment test the average growth rate in the detailed planning period was . py . for the cgus of the  automotive segment . py . for those of the tires segment and . py . for those of the contitech segment.  contract manufacturing for vitesco technologies is reported in the contract manufacturing segment a nd will conclude by the end of the detailed planning period. the long term growth rate was . py . for the cgus of the automotive segment . py . for those of the tires and contitech segments and . py . for those of the contract m anufacturing segment. these growth rates do not exceed the long term average growth rates for the markets in which the cgus operate.  the annual impairment testing of goodwill determined no requirements for impairment for . in the original equipment cgu of the tires segment the carrying amount exceeded the value in use. as there was no significant goodwill the recoverability of the individual assets was reviewed whereby these are mainly production related machines and buildings that are n ot used exclusively by the original equipment cgu but are also used by the three cgus replacement emea europe the middle east and africa replacement apac asia pacific region and replacement the americas north central and south america. this revie w did not reveal any need for impairment since the fair value less costs of disposal for the individual assets exceeds their respective carrying amount. fair values were derived on the basis of valuation reports relating to the properties and current mark et values for comparable machinery and technical equipment among other things.  assuming a . percentage point increase in the discount rate would not lead to any goodwill impairment. no asset impairment would result. reducing the long term growth rate by  . percentage points would not lead to any goodwill impairment. no asset impairment would result. if sales in perpetuity would decline by . consequently reducing free cash flow as a key planning parameter this would not lead to any goodwill impairme nt. no asset impairment would result.  assets held for sale and related liabilities  a non current asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale and is presented separately in the statement of financial position  if its carrying amount will be rec overed principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. for this to be the case the asset or disposal group must be available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sa les of such assets or disposal groups and  its sale must be highly probable.  a non current asset or disposal group held for sale is measured  at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell where it meets the held for sale criteria. depreciation of these assets ceases once they are classified as held for sale. immediately before the initial classification of the asset or disposal group as held for sale the carrying amounts shall be measured in accordance with the applicable ifrs .  a non current asset or disposal group is classified as held for distribution to owners when the entity is committed to distribute the asset or disposal group to the owners. for this to be the case the assets must be available for immediate distribu tion in their present condition and the distribution must be highly probable. a non current asset or disposal group held for distribution is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to distribute.,,,,,,0.2566014146362551,,0.3849820658474648,,,,,,,,0.1765705502606617,,,
142,continental ag    annual report   consolidated financial statements    notes to the consolidated financial statements    on subsequent remeasurement of a disposal group the carrying amounts of any assets and liabilities that are not within the scope of the measurement requirements of ifrs  non current assets held for sale and discontinued operations  but are included in a disposal group classifie d as held for sale shall be remeasured in  accordance with the applicable ifrs before the fair value less costs to sell of the disposal group is remeasured.  a discontinued operation can also be classified as held for sale under ifrs . a discontinued oper ation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. the classification of a component of an entity as a discontinued operation is also appropriate in the case of classification as held for distribution provided the criteria are met.  financial instruments  a financial instrument as defined in ias  financial instruments presentation is a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.  in the continental group a purchase or sale of financial assets or  financial liabilities is recognized or derecognized at the settlement date.  financial assets  financial assets are recognized in the statement of financial position as at the date continental becomes a contractual party to the financial instrument. at the acquisition date they must be classified into measurement categories that determine the subsequent accounting.  receivables from the receivables factoring programs carried out in the continental group are recognized in the statement of financial position when the risks and rewards in particular credit and default risk have not been essentially t ransferred. the repayment obligations therefrom are as a rule then shown as short term financial  liabilities.  the classification and measurement of financial assets that constitute debt instruments is based on the business model in which the assets are managed and on their cash flow characteristics. these conditions are cumulative criteria whose audit sequence is irrelevant.  it is therefore necessary to analyze the business model in which the asset to be classified is held. this relates to the investig ation of the way in which financial assets held in order to collect cash flows are managed. the continental group reclassifies debt instruments if the corresponding business model changes.  ifrs  financial instruments  distinguishes between three business  models   hold tocollect the objective of this business model is to hold  the financial assets and generate the contractual cash flows. this model is the prevalent business model in the continental group.   hold tocollect and sale this business model aims  to collect the contractual cash flows or sell the financial assets. this business model does occur  for example in connection with notes receivable  but is fundamentally of subordinate importance in the continental group.   other this business model constitutes a catch all category. this model occurs in the continental group in connection with recognized trade accounts receivable from third parties which will probably be sold under a true sale ofreceivables factoring agreement however it is fundamenta lly of subordinate importance in the continental group.  in addition to the analysis of the business model the contractual terms applicable on acquisition of the financial instrument must also be assessed sppi solely payments of principal and interest criterion. the sppi criterion is met when the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. contractual cash flows that are solely  payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are  consistent with a basic lending arrangement.,0.2484096925839922,0.2840923381235924,0.3653669839362916,0.3686142200512879,0.3921241520519894,0.2809882319446395,0.4807645356699342,0.3847783198065162,0.3300359916785963,0.2967284893355325,0.4633100896681016,0.322504452441347,0.2720292888661693,0.3799936804864448,0.2906178485704804,0.2026274794546706,0.1379296990191219,0.1813924394007932,0.4316015305880346
143,continental ag    annual report   consolidated financial statements    notes to the consolidated financial statements    on the basis of the aforementioned conditions a distinction is drawn between the following measurement categories for financial as sets that constitute debt instruments   measured at cost the financial asset which constitutes a debt  instrument is held within a business model whose objective is  to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows. furthermore the contractual cash flows can be characterized as payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. interest income is recognized in the financial result using t he effective interest method. gains or losses arising from derecognition are recognized in profit or loss together with the foreign currency gains and losses. impairment losses are likewise recognized separately in the income statement.   measured at fair v alue through other comprehensive income with reclassification fvociwr the financial asset which constitutes a debt instrument is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial a ssets. furthermore the contractual cash flows can be characterized as payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. changes in the carrying amount are recognized in other comprehensive income. income or expenses from impairment interest income and foreign currency gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss. the cumulative gain or loss stated in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to the income statement when the financial asset is derecognized. interest income is recognized in the financial result using the effective interest method. foreign currency gains and losses are recognized in other income and expenses.   measured at fair value through profit or loss fvpl the financial asset which constitutes a  debt instrument is not to be measured at cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income with reclassification fvociwr as either the sppi criterion was not met or the other business model applies. classification to the measured at fair val ue through profit or loss fvpl category can also be appropriate if the fair value option is applied to debt instruments that should actually be classified as measured at cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income with reclassification fvo ciwr. however the continental group does not currently intend to apply the fair value option to debt instruments. income or expense from a financial asset measured at fair value through profit or loss is recognized in the income statement.  investments t hat fall within the scope of ifrs  financial instruments  and meet the definition of equity must generally be measured at fair value. for equity instruments that are neither held for trading nor constitute contingent consideration accounted for by the ac quirer in a business combination according to ifrs  business combinations  the continental group decides at the acquisition date for each equity instrument whether to exercise the option of recognizing changes in fair value in other comprehensive incom e fair value oci option. the cumulative gain or loss in other comprehensive income is not reclassified to the income statement when the financial asset is derecognized. this results in the measurement category of fair value through other comprehensive in come without reclassification  fvociwor . dividends are an exception to this and continue to be recognized in profit or loss when the legal entitlement is established unless this relates to a partial restitution of acquisition costs. dividends are recognized in other income from investments.  equity instruments held for trading purposes or for which the fair value oci option is not utilized are without exception accounted  for at fair value through profit or loss fvpl.  on initial recognition the continen tal group measures a financial asset at fair value plus the transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition with the exception of financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss for which associated transaction costs are recogni zed as expense in the income statement.  impairment is recognized using the expected loss model. the impairment model applies to financial assets measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income fvoci except for investments  in equity instruments contract assets that result from ifrs  revenue from contracts with customers  lease receivables loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts.  loss allowances are measured on the basis of  month expected credit losses o r on the basis of lifetime expected credit losses.  month expected credit losses result from possible default events within  months after the reporting date. lifetime expected credit losses result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.,0.2759123312977623,0.2810234854361351,0.3210865735691443,0.3383061726713793,0.3257754784155452,0.2801883807293065,0.4306351335846631,0.3413070519841606,0.3032638836672952,0.2732244923878806,0.4228468132349238,0.2374718526202146,0.2395548405879299,0.3438999421354591,0.2519837557090654,0.2079701860490927,0.0810868753612581,0.165633665302584,0.3424953156076905
144,continental ag    annual report   consolidated financial statements    notes to the consolidated financial statements    lifetime expected credit loss measurement applies if the credit risk of a financial asset at the reporting date has increased significantly since initial recognition and  month expected credit loss measurement applies if it has not. the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition when contractual payments are more than  days past due on the reporting date.  for trade accounts receivable and contract assets with and without significant financing components lease payments receivable and current receivables from related parties only lifetime expected credit loss measurement is applied. under this approach the lifetime expected credit losses must be recognized from the initial recog nition of the receivable.  a financial asset is in default or credit impaired if one of the following criteria is met   insolvency or a similar event that indicates significant financial difficulty and a probable default of the counterparty.   probable debt w aiver.   a breach of contract that leads to the assumption that it is more probable that one or more receivables are not collectible.   other reasons in the assessment of credit management that lead to the assumption that it is more probable that the receivabl es are not collectible.  if there is evidence of uncollectibility the financial asset is derecognized. if creditworthiness improves the allowance is reversed.  financial liabilities  financial liabilities are recognized in the statement of financial position as at the date continental becomes a contractual party to the financial instrument.  financial liabilities are generally measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. instruments that are held for trading are classified as financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss. for financial liabilities not held for trading the fair value option can be exercised. if the fair value option is used the portion of the change in the fair value due to changes i n the credit risk of the liability is recognized in other comprehensive income. the fair value option is not currently exercised in the continental group. in the consolidated financial statements of continental ag all non derivative financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost  which as a rule comprises the remaining principal balance and issuing costs net of any unamortized premium or discount. financial obligations with fixed or determinable payments that comprise neither financial liabilities n or derivative financial liabilities and are not quoted in an active market are reported in the statement of financial position under other financial liabilities in accordance with their term.  in the case of information reported in accordance with ifrs    financial instruments disclosures classification is in line with the items disclosed in the statement of financial position andor the measurement category used in accordance with ifrs  financial instruments . derivative financial instruments and hedg e accounting  derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss fvpl. the fair value is generally the market or exchange price. in the absence of an active market the fair value is determined using financial models.  fair values of currency forwards are calculated by way of future cash flows being translated into one of the two currencies using forward rates netted discounted with risk free interest rates and then translated into the functional currency of the respective subsidiary at current spot exchange rates if applicable par method.  the value of options is determined by applying recognized option pricing models.  to calculate the fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps the future cash flows are discounted with the interest rates for the respective maturities with primarily deposit rates risk free interest rates or ibor rates used as short term interest rates while long term interest rates are based on the swap rates in the respec tive currency. future cash flows are forecast using interest rate curves with an appropriate payment tenor. when discounting currency basis spreads or if applicable tenor basis spreads are taken into account.  the measurement of derivative instruments takes into account the credit spread in general.  derivative instruments are recognized at the date when the obligation to buy or sell the instrument arises.  for the current status of implementation of the ibor ref orm and its impact on the consolidated financial statements of continental see note .  hedge accounting is currently not applied.  the amount of the effective portion of the change in value of the hedges remaining from the hedging of foreign currency ris ks from net investments in foreign operations is still recognized together with the effect from the currency translation of the net investment in the difference from currency translation in equity. the accumulated currency effects are not reclassified in p rofit and loss until the foreign operations are sold or liquidated.,,,,0.3105324445795246,,,,,,,0.3683891460140939,0.1968734128604347,,,,,,,0.3239955459026172
145,continental ag    annual report   consolidated financial statements    notes to the consolidated financial statements    embedded derivatives  an embedded derivative is a component of a hybrid contract alongside a non derivative host contract. a portion of the cash flows of the hybrid contract is therefore subject to similar variability as a separate derivative.  non derivative host contracts with the exception of financial  assets are regularly inspected within the continental group for  embedded derivatives.  if the host contract does not fall under the scope of ifrs  or if the host contract is a financial liability embedded derivatives must b e separated from the host contract if the assessment finds that the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract a separate instrument with the same te rms would meet the definition of a derivative and continental does not exercise the option to measure the entire hybrid instrument at fair value through profit or loss.  if separation is appropriate the host contract is accounted for in  accordance with the relevant ifrs requirements. the embedded derivative is recognized at fair value through profit or loss fvpl.  inventories  inventories are recognized at the lower of cost and net realizable value. acquisition cost is generally determined using the weig hted average method. production cost includes direct costs production related material costs overheads and depreciation. inventory risks resulting from decreased marketability or excessive storage periods are accounted for with write downs.  other assets  other assets are recognized at amortized cost. allowances are  recognized as appropriate to reflect any possible risk related to  recoverability.  accounting for income taxes  income taxes are measured using the concept of the statement of financial positio n liability method in accordance with ias  income taxes . tax expenses and refunds that relate to income are recognized as income taxes. late payment fines and interest arising from subsequently assessed taxes are not reported under the item income tax e xpense but rather as interest income and expense.  current taxes owed on income are recognized as expenses when they are incurred. they are determined taking into account the respective local tax laws and relevant case law. the complexity of these regulations and the possible differences in interpretation between taxpayers on the one hand and local tax authorities on the other may lead to uncertainties regarding the handling of individual facts and circumstances. these uncertain tax positions are measured in accordance with ifric  as the mostly likely amount. owing to the lack of an unrestricted market comparison determining prices for cross border intercompany transactions is extremely complex and therefore subject to uncertainty. in the continental grou p prices are therefore regularly determined on the basis of the internationally recognized arms length principle taking into account the transfer pricing methods specified by lawmakers and the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd . if there are multiple tax uncertainties and a correlation between them and certain tax parameters they are presented in the financial statements either individually or as a group depending on how the risk is realized.  deferred taxes include expected tax payments and refunds from temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the related tax bases as well as from the utilization of loss carryforwards. no deferred tax is recognized for non taxdeductible  goodwill. the deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the applicable tax rates related to the  period when the temporary differences are expected to reverse. changes in tax rates are recognized once the rate has been substantially enacted. def erred tax assets are not recognized if it is  not probable that they will be realized in the future.  in a country specific review the extent to which tax related risks that are likely to occur can or must be offset against losses or loss carryforwards in the individual countries or tax groups is analyzed. if there is a need for offsetting in the countries or tax groups the probable tax related risks are offset against the associated losses and loss carryforwards. as a result the disclosure of deferred ta xes on loss carryforwards includes a risk adjustment for the continental group units affected.  income tax receivables and liabilities are recognized as current items as they are due immediately and this due date often cannot be deferred.  as at the end o f the reporting period the regulations known as the pillar two model rules of the oecd governing a global minimum corporate tax rate had already been carried over into german law under the minimum tax act  mindeststeuergesetz  minstg  and apply from janu ary  . the continental group falls within the scope of these regulations.  the minimum tax is levied at the level of ina holding schaeffler gmbh  co. kg herzogenaurach germany as the parent company of the iho group ultimate parent entity and gr oup parent. within the framework of the requirements stipulated by the minimum tax regulations continental ag as the parent company of the continental group acts as a partially owned parent entity. continental ag is included in the consolidated financia l statements of inaholding schaeffler gmbh  co. kg herzogenaurach germany and for this reason is jointly assessed with the other companies of the iho group when determining the minimum tax. continental ag is obligated in accordance with section    minstg  to compensate ina holding schaeffler gmbh  co. kg herzogenaurach germany for the share of the minimum tax attributable to continental ag. owing to the expected introduction of so called recognized national top up taxes it is possible that the duty to  pay the minimum tax due may fall on group subsidiaries other than continental ag.  the rules governing the global minimum tax

146,continental ag    annual report   consolidated financial statements    notes to the consolidated financial statements    schaeffler gmbh  co. kg herzogenaurach germany. in a transition period for the fiscal years  through  so called safe harbor rules linked to the fulfillment of certain criteria may be utilized that allow companies to dispense with the exact calculation of the minimum tax with the minimum tax being set at zero in such cases.  continental together with  the iho group has conducted an initial indicative analysis to determine the future impact of the regulations governing the global minimum tax. in argentina greece the philippines singapore spain south korea and the united arab emirates a tax rate o f less than  may apply based on the global minimum tax regulations. the proportional minimum tax expense for the continental group based on this analysis lies in the mid seven figure range. the anticipated impact on the effective corporate tax rate is t herefore insignificant.  employee benefits  the retirement benefits offered by the continental group comprise both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.  pension provisions under defined benefit plans are actuarially measured pursuant to ias  employee benefits  revised  using the projected unit credit method that reflects salary pension and employee fluctuation trends. the discount rate to determine the present value is based on long term loans in the respective capital market. actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other co mprehensive income. expenses from interest cost on pension liabilities and income from pension funds are reported net in the financial result.  accordingly the interest effects of other long term employee benefits are reported in the financial result. pens ion liabilities for some companies of the continental group are covered by pension funds. furthermore plan assets comprise all assets as well as claims from insurance contracts that are held exclusively toward payments to those entitled to pensions and are not available to meet the claims of other creditors. pension obligations and plan assets are reported on a net basis in the statement of financial position.  the other post employment benefits also shown under the employee benefits relate to obligations  to pay for health costs for retired workers in the usa and canada in particular.  defined contribution plans represent retirement benefits where the company only contributes contractually fixed amounts for current service entitlements which are generally invested by independent external asset managers until the date of retirement of the employee. the fixed amounts are partly dependent on the level of the employees own contribution. the company gives no guarantees of the value of the asset after the fixed  contribution either at the retirement date or beyond. the entitlement is therefore settled by the contributions paid in the year.  provisions for other risks and obligations  provisions are recognized when a legal or constructive obligation has arisen that  is likely to result in a future cash outflow to third parties and the amount can be reliably determined or estimated. the provisions are recognized as at the end of the reporting period at the value at which the obligations could probably be settled or transferred to a third party. non current provisions such as those for litigation or environmental risks are discounted to their present value. the resulting periodic interest charge for the provisions is shown under the financial result including an effect from a change in interest.  non financial liabilities  current non financial liabilities are carried at their settlement amount. non current non financial liabilities are measured at  amortized cost.  share based payments  cash settled share based payments ar e measured at fair value  using a monte carlo simulation. the liabilities are recognized under employee benefits until the end of the holding period. equity settled share based payments are measured at the fair value of the granted equity instruments.  esti mates  proper and complete preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the amount and disclosure of the recognized assets and liabilities income and expenses as well as the disclosure s in the notes for the reporting period.  the significant assumptions and estimates in the reporting period related to   the determination of the useful lives of intangible assets and property plant and equipment.   the impairment testing of goodwill and non current assets in  particular the underlying cash flow forecasts and discount rates determination of the recoverable.   the

147,continental ag    annual report   consolidated financial statements    notes to the consolidated financial statements     the measurement of revenue reductions and reimbursement  liabilities within the sc ope of revenue recognition.   the actuarial parameters influencing share based payments.   the recognition and measurement of liabilities and provisions  in particular the actuarial parameters for pensions and similar  obligations used to determine defined benefit obligations.   the point in time at which assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale.   the recognition and measurement of provisions and  contingent liabilities in particular with regard to the parameters for measuring restructuring provisions as well as the probability of occurrence and the amount of warranty litigation and environmental risks.  the assumptions and estimates are based on  the information currently available at the date of preparation of the consolidated financial statements. the underlying information is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect actual developments as necessary.  we again reviewed whether climate related issues had a significant effect on reporting in the year under review. such effects are possible in a number of different areas. climate related aspects can affect for example the recoverability of non financial assets and inventories the useful life and  residual carrying values of assets the expected credit losses of financial instruments the input factors and assumptions used to measure value in use and fair value e.g. discount rates point in time and amount of projected cash flows deferred tax as sets legal and de facto obligations provisions and contingent liabilities financial risk management market risk liquidity risk and default risk as well as risk concentration and the financial accounting of participation in emissions trading systems  and of energy supply agreements.  climate related risk factors were therefore considered in estimates and judgments when preparing the consolidated financial statements.  climate related aspects are also considered in the management  remuneration structure.  as described in detail in the remuneration report the long term incentive l ti for the executive board members includes a sustainability score as a second performance criterion in addition to the degree of target achievement of the relative total shareh older return tsr. to determine the lti to be paid out this sustainability score is multiplied as a factor between . and . by the degree of target achievement of the relative tsr. the supervisory board sets out up to six performance criteria and targets for the sustainability score of the respective lti plan. the targets are based on the continental groups sustainability ambition the reported sustainability indicators and associated corporate targets as well as management processes which are specif ied in detail in the non financial statement within the management report. the target values for the individual target years of the lti are derived from the medium and long term corporate targets. for own co emissions for example the target path of the  carbon neutrality target and the corresponding intermediate steps for the respective lti target values are used. the basis for measuring the target achievement is the measurement of performance in the corresponding period or in the last year of the pl an. for own co emissions the strategic orientation for the defined target values where necessary with interim steps for the individual tranches in order to achieve the long term goal is to reduce own co  emissions to . million metric tons of co  by   and to net zero by . these targets are included in the         and   lti plans.  as in previous years no significant effects of climate related risk factors on reporting were identified. there were also no significant effects on individual items in the reporting period.  based on available information the effects of the current macroeconomic environment on the accounting of the continental group were also continuously reviewed over the course of . the macroeconomic environment continued to be shaped in particular by high inflation and the development of interest rates in the reporting period. the analysis of the effects of the macroeconomic environment on the accounting of the continental group included  in particular the impairment testing of non financial assets the review of actuarial assumptions used to measure employee benefits and the review of the measurement of financial instruments and revenue from contracts with customers. this had no material effect on the reporting of the continental group in the reporting period. overall as in the previous year there was a high level of uncertainty when making estimates in the reporting year.  the development of the geopolitical situation remains difficult  to predict. we cannot foresee the effects that the ongoing war in ukraine and the middle east conflict which flared up in october as well as the associated disruptions to production supply chains and demand will have on accounting. the level of uncertainty involved when making estimates is higher than in previous reporting periods. continental therefore reviewed the effects of the war on the accounting of the continental group as at december   on the basis of the information available in the reporting period. due to the ongoing war in ukraine and the unclear development of the geopolitical situation in the reporting period continental ag sold  all russian operations in the automotive and tires segments and some russian operations in the contitech  segment. for further details please refer to the section on acquisition and disposal of companies and business operations in this report. following the sale only immaterial operations in the contitech segment remained in russia as at december  .  with respect to further developments concerning the war in ukraine the conflict in the middle east climate related aspects and the macroeconomic environment the continental group is still continuously reviewing the possible effects on accounting.,0.2687847842174639,,,0.3119542335793573,0.2993363427958523,,,,0.262931952323694,,0.3386398453715387,,,,0.1808532986839466,,0.0590653359562546,,

sources during the reporting period that generated cash and ca sh equivalents as well as the application of cash and cash equivalents. this includes all cash and cash equivalents and demand deposits. cash equivalents are short term highly liquid financial investments that can be readily converted into known cash amou nts and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.  the restrictions that may impact the availability of capital are also understood to comprise all existing restrictions on the cash and cash equivalents. in the continental group the cash a nd cash equivalents are restricted with regard to pledged amounts and  balances in countries with foreign exchange restrictions or other barriers to accessing liquidity. taxes to be paid on the transfer of cash assets from one country to another are not us ually considered to represent a restriction on cash and cash equivalents.  financial investments are considered to be cash equivalents only  if they

ultimately liable for the implementation path of the pension contribution fund. in accordance with ias  employee benefits  the pension obligations  covered by the pension contribution fund are therefore defined benefit pension plans. the pension contribution funds met their minimum net funding requirement as at december  . however given that only the plan members are entitled to the assets and amounts generated the benefit obligations are recognized in the same amount as the existing assets at fair value.  continental also supports private contribution through deferred compensation schemes.  deferred compensation is essentially offered throug h a fully funded multi employer plan höchster pensionskasse vvag for contributions up to  of the assessment ceiling in social security. the pension contribution fund ensures guaranteed minimum interest for which continental is ultimately liable under t he german company pensions law. the company is not liable for guarantees to employees of other companies. as höchster pensionskasse vvag is a combined defined benefit plan for several companies and continental has no right to the information required for a ccounting for this defined benefit plan this plan is recognized as  a defined contribution plan.  entitled employees can use the cash balance plan for deferred compensation contributions above the  assessment ceiling. this share is funded by insurance an nuity contracts.  usa  owing to its acquisition history continental has various defined benefit plans in the usa which were closed to new entrants and frozen to accretion of further benefits in a period from april   to december  . in  ac quisitions also included an open defined benefit plan for unionized employees.  the closed defined benefit plans are commitments on the basis of the average final salary and cash balance commitments. the defined benefit plans for unionized and non unionized  employees  are based on a pension multiplier per year of service.  closed defined benefit plans were replaced by defined contribution plans. defined contribution plans apply to the majority of  active employees in the usa.  due to the rise in interest rat es further efforts are currently being made to push for additional funding.  the plan assets of the defined benefit plans are managed in a master trust. investment supervision was delegated to the pension committee a body appointed within the continental group. the  legal and regulatory framework for the plans is based on the us employee retirement income security act erisa.  the valuation of the financing level is required on the basis of this law. the interest rate used for this calculation is the aver age rate over a period of  years and therefore currently higher than the interest rate used to discount obligations under ias . the statutory valuation therefore gives rise to a lower obligation than that in line with ias . there is a regulatory requ irement to ensure minimum funding of  in the defined benefit plans to prevent benefit curtailments.  united kingdom  continental maintains four defined benefit plans as a result of its history of acquisitions in the united kingdom. all plans are commitmen ts on the basis of the average or final salary. the four plans were closed to new employees in the period between april    and november  . continental offers defined contribution plans for all employees who have joined the company since that time.  as at april   the continental group pension and life assurance scheme was frozen to accretion of further benefits.  it was  replaced by a defined contribution plan as at april  .  as at july   the mannesmann uk pension scheme was frozen to accretion of further benefits. it was replaced by a defined contribution plan as at august  .  our pension strate gy in the uk focuses on reducing risks and includes the option of partial or complete funding by purchasing annuities. the rise in interest rates and the good funded status currently present opportunities to push for partial or complete funding. the recept ivity of the insurance market is currently limited.  the funding conditions are defined by the uk pensions regulator and the corresponding laws and regulations. the defined benefit plans are managed by trust companies. the boards of trustees of these compan ies have an obligation solely to the good of the beneficiaries on the basis of the trust agreement and the law.,,,,,,,,,0.2573306427239337,,0.3971058479871714,,,,0.2024921100438101,0.2088705519600739,0.0854071405631428,,

the  lti tranche in december  the bonus was not paid out in  as the fair value of the tranche as at the payment date was . million.  for each beneficiary of an lti tranche the supervisory board for the members of the executive board or the executive board for senior executives of continental ag specified the amount of a target bonus in euros to be paid out upon  target achievement. the actual lti bonus paid out on expiry of the lti tranche depends on the degree of target achievement. the lti bonus can range between  no payme nt and  maximum payment.  the degree of achievement of two target criteria is decisive for the payment and amount of the lti bonus. the first target criterion is the equally weighted average of the continental value contribution cvc of the continen tal group over a period of four fiscal years starting from the fiscal year in which the lti tranche is issued. the equally weighted average is calculated by adding together  of the cvc of the four fiscal years of the term of the lti tranche. the second  target criterion is the total shareholder return tsr on continental shares as at the end of the term in relation to the beginning of the lti tranche. the share price used in calculating the tsr is the arithmetic mean of closing prices in xetra trading on the frankfurt stock exchange or a successor system on the trading days in the three months from october to december before the issue and expiry of the lti tranche. in addition all dividends paid during the term of the lti tranche are taken into accoun t for the tsr.  the scale for determining the degree of target achievement is defined by the supervisory board or the executive board when the  respective lti tranche is issued. this key data is identical for the members of the executive board and senior e xecutives. the degree of target achievement for the first target criterion can lie between  and . target achievement is calculated on a straight line basis between  and the maximum amount. there is no cap for the second target criterion. the ultima te degree of target achievement used to calculate the lti bonus to be paid out is determined by multiplying the two target criteria. the lti bonus to be paid out is determined by multiplying the degree of target achievement by the target bonus. the total m aximum achievable lti bonus is  of the target bonus.  a monte carlo simulation is used in the measurement of the tsr target criterion. this means that log normal distributed processes are simulated for the price of continental shares. the monte carlo simulation takes into account the average value accumulation of share prices in the respective reference period the tsr dividends and the restriction for the payment amount.    transformation incentive plan tip  in  the continental group offered its senior executives the possibility of participating in the long term sustainable increase in the continental groups value by paying a tip bonus in addition to the fixed salary and the annual variable remuneration. the term of the tip which the executi ve board adopted for senior executives on september   extends from october   to december  . after the expiry of the tip bonus in december  the bonus was paid out in june .  the executive board of continental ag specified the am ount of the target bonus tip bonus in euros for each beneficiary of a tip bonus senior executives. the tip bonus is calculated based on a certain number of virtual shares of continental ag basic holding which can increase through two bonus packages  multiplied by the payment share price. the payment share price is the arithmetic mean of continental ags closing share prices in xetra trading on the frankfurt stock exchange or a successor system on the trading days in the last month prior to the annu al shareholders meeting that follows the end of the term. the tip bonus which can total at most  of the initial share price is paid to the respective beneficiary as a gross lump sum at the end of the second complete calendar month following the annu al shareholders meeting that follows the end of the term. since the basic holding can be increased through two bonus packages the degree of achievement of two target criteria is decisive for the amount of the tip bonus. the target criterion of the first bonus package is the results of the our basics live corporate survey in . if at least  equally weighted average of all participants respond positively to the sustainable engagement index the beneficiary receives additional virtual shares equivalent to  of the basic holding. the target criterion of the second bonus package is met if at the end of the term the tsr on continental shares equals or exceeds the performance of the stoxx europe  automobiles  parts index. in this case the beneficiary receives additional virtual shares equivalent to  of the basic holding. the tsr on continental shares corresponds to the sum of the share price performance as at the end of the term and all dividends distributed during the term relative to the shar e price at the beginning of the term. the share price used in calculating the tsr is the arithmetic mean of the closing prices in xetra trading on the frankfurt stock exchange or a successor system on the trading days i in the first month of the term  initial share price and ii in the last month of the term final share price.,0.2251533971114306,,,,,,,,0.3063726693599036,0.234428539207195,,0.18415022549956,0.2472465680020666,0.2835984425938727,0.2167093266862099,0.2631538283464994,,0.1174786588226179,0.3085504216469126

frankfurt stock exchange or a successor system in the last two months prior to the start of the term of the  respective lti plan issue price. the basic holding is multiplied by a performance index pi in order to determine the final holding of virtual shares. the performance index corresponds to the product from the relative total shareholder return tsr on continental shares and a sustainability score. the relative tsr is calculated from the relative performance of the continental tsr in comparison with the tsr on the stoxx europe  automobiles  parts sxagr. the continental tsr corresponds to the sum of  the average continental share price in the last month of the term final share price and all dividends distributed during the term relative to the average share price in the first month of the term initial share price. the sxagr tsr is determined using the same method.  performance criteria and goals of the sustainability score are targets for co emissions recycling quotas and the review of good working conditions for employees in the continental group e.g. based on sick leave acciden t rates and employee satisfaction.  the payment amount of the  to  lti plan can total at most  of the defined initial share price executives and senior executives or issue price executive board. the issue price is the average price of the two months before the start of the term.  the final holding of virtual shares is multiplied by the payout ratio in order to determine the gross amount of the lti to be paid out in euros hereinafter payout amount. the payout ratio is the sum of the arit

of financial instruments  due to its international business activities and the resulting financing requirements the continenta l group is exposed to default risks risks from changes in exchanges rates and variable interest rates and liquidity risk. the management of these risks is described in the following sections.  in addition hedging instruments are used in the continental group. their use is covered by corporate wide policies adherence to which is regularly reviewed by internal auditors. internal settlement risks are minimized through the clear segregation of functional areas.  further information about the risks presented  below and about risk management can be found in the report on risks and opportunities in the consolidated management report.  . default risks  default risks from trade accounts receivable contract assets or other financial assets include the risk that rec eivables will be collected late or not at all if a customer or another contractual party does not fulfill its contractual obligations. the total of the positive carrying amounts is equivalent to the maximum default risk of the continental group from financial assets. default risk is influenced mainly by characteristics of the customers and the sector and is therefore analyzed and monitored by central and local credit managers. the responsibilities of the credit management function also include pooled receiv ables risk management. contractual partners creditworthiness and payment history are analyzed on a regular basis.  default risk for non derivative financial receivables is also limited  by ensuring that agreements are entered into with partners with proven  creditworthiness only or that collateral is provided or in individual cases trade credit insurance is agreed. the continental group held an immaterial amount of collateral as at december  . there are no trade accounts receivable or contract asset s for which an impairment loss was not recognized due to collateral held.  however default risk cannot be excluded with absolute certainty and any remaining risk is addressed by recognizing expected credit losses for identified individual risks and on the basis of experience taking account of any relevant future components. financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired accordingly have a prime credit rating. default risks are calculated on the basis of corporate wide standards. the methods for c alculating loss allowances are described in note  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  trade accounts receivable and contract assets  if the creditworthiness of receivables is impaired corresponding expenses are recognized in an allowance account.  lifetime expected credit losses are largely calculated using estimates and assessments based on the creditworthiness of the respective customer current economic developments and the analysis of historical losses on receivables. the cred itworthiness of a customer is assessed on the basis of its payment history and its ability to make payments. it is regularly reviewed whether there is a need to take account of any risks in connection with different customer groups sectors or countries. n o such allocation of default risk was required in .  continental calculates the default rates for lifetime expected credit losses based on a three year average taking account of the historical defaults allocated to the different periods past due and g enerally also taking account of a forward looking component. trade accounts receivable and contract assets whose creditworthiness is already

management actual and expected foreign currency cash flows are combined as operational foreign exchange exposures in the form of net cash flows for each transaction currency on a rolling  month basis. these cash flows arise mainl y from receipts and payments from external and intra corporate transactions by the continental groups subsidiaries worldwide.  a natural hedge approach for reducing currency risks has been pursued for several years meaning that the difference between  receipts and payments in any currency is kept as low as possible. exchange rate developments are also monitored analyzed and forecast. based on the operational foreign exchange exposure and constantly updated exchange rate forecasts the interest rate and currency committee which convenes weekly agrees on the hedging measures to be implemented in individual cases by concluding derivative instruments particularly currency forwards currency swaps and currency options with a term of up to  months. their amount must not exceed  of the  month exposure per currency without executive board permission. in addition further risk limits for open derivative positions are set which considerably reduce the risks from hedging activities. hedge accounting was no t used in the reporting year or in the previous year for hedges concluded in this way. as at december   currency forwards to hedge against

financial foreign currency risks  in addition to operational foreign currency risk currency risks also result from the continental g roups external and internal net indebtedness that is denominated in
