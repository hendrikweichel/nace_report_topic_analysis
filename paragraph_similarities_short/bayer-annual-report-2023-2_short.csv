comprehensive risk management system we have an internal cont rol system over financial reporting icsofr in place for th e group accounting and financial re porting process. this system comprises suitable structures and workflows th at are defined and implemented throughout the organization. the purpose of ou r icsofr is to ensure proper and effective accounting and group financial reporting in accordance with the relevant reporting principles. the icsofr is designed to guarantee timely uniform and accura te accounting for all business transactions based on applicable statutory regulations accounting and financial report ing standards and the inte rnal group policies that are binding on all consolidated companies. risk s are identified and assessed and appropriate countermeasures are taken to mitigate them. manda tory groupwide standards such as systembased and manual reconciliation processes an d functional separation have been  derived from these frameworks and promulgated throughout the bayer group. thes e standards are implemented by the bayer group companies. compliance with these standards is the responsibility of the resp ective management teams. however it should be noted that an internal control system irrespective of its design cannot provide absolute assurance that material misstatements in th e financial reporting will be avoided or identified.  compliance management system  our compliance management system is aligned to the companys risk status and aims to ensure lawful and responsible conduct by our employees. it is design ed to identify potential violations in advance and systematically prevent their occurre nce. the compliance management syst em thus contributes significantly to the integration of compliance into our operating units and their processes. detailed information on the compliance management system can be found in chapter a . compliance which describes in particular the process of identifying risks and taking measures to mitigate them. independent internal and external monitoring the internal audit department conducts independent riskbased and objective audit activities employing a targeted and

108,bayer annual report  a combined management report. opportunity and risk report research and development high pharmaceuticals across our businesses we see opportunities both in the continued development of  our brands and in the expansion of our research pipeline as a result of  our innovation capabilitie s. in the pharmaceuticals division opportunities arise from data science and ai and associated new rd methods that save time and enhance rd productivity. in addition new uniqu e screening technologies facilitate the identification of new lead structures to unlock previously undruggable targets with the potential to develop new and innovative products. we also rely on networking both within the company and with external partners to boost our innovation capabilities. this stimulates the development of new products.  technological advances in pharmaceutical product de velopment may at the same time also represent a risk for our company should we not be in a position to play a role in shaping such advances. securing access to new technologies and identifying a sufficien t number of research candidates in general while also ensuring their appropriate development represents  a particular challenge. targeting inlicensing and acquisitions as additional ways to strengthen our co mpany involves the risk that we may be unable to identify a sufficient number of suit able candidates on financially accepta ble terms. we cannot ensure that all of the development candidates we currently have in  our pipeline or will have in the future will be developed to the stage at which they are ready to be launched on the market or that they will obtain their planned approvalregistration or achieve commercia l success. these goals may not be reached if for example we are unable to satisfy technical or capacity requirements or meet time constraints in product development fail to achieve study objectives or do not allocate financial resources optimally. delays or cost overruns may occur during product registration  or launch. we counter this risk through holistic portfolio management by estimati ng the probability of success and pr ioritizing develo pment projects. thanks to our innovation capacities and budgets within the crop science division we anticipate that we will be able to leverage opportunities and effectivel y tackle the challenges faced in developing and introducing product solutions in agriculture includ ing longer and more costly  development cycles or stricter regulatory requirements. we plan to further leverage the strengths of our rd platform to deliver pioneering technologies faster. in addi tion we will leverage our existing ex pertise and strategically invest in new capabilities to unlock and capture new market segments. supply of products procurement production logistics  high group medium crop science pharmaceuticals  despite all precautions operations at our sites ma y be disrupted by fires power outages process changeovers  including those due to restrictions on the use of certain chemical substances  or plant breakdowns for example. in addition some of our pr oduction facilities are located in areas that may be affected by natural disasters such as  flooding or earthquakes. the materi alization of any of these risks could lead to production disruptions or stoppages resu lt in personal injury and damage to our reputation lead to declines in sales andor ma rgins and necessitate the reconstruc tion of damaged infrastructure. if we are unable to meet product demand sales may under go a structural decline because patients may in the meantime be receiving alternative treatments an d may not switch back to our products. we address this risk for certain products by building up safety stocks and by sp reading production across multiple sites for example. furthermore an emergency response system ba sed on a corresponding corporate policy has been implemented at all our production sites. disruptions in our upstream suppl y chain may also negatively imp act our own supply capability. the substances we procure and the companies that ma nufacture them must meet all necessary regulatory requirements. these substan ces must also be suitable for fulfilling regulatory requirements further down the value chain. certain materials particularly in ou r pharmaceuticals division are offered by only a small number of suppliers. we counter these risks by establishing relationships with alternative suppliers concluding longterm agr eements expanding inventories and producing raw materials ourselves. supplier risks are regularly reviewed and evaluated.  as a result of geopolitical risks and the internatio nal supply chain disruption they are causing risks relating to the availability of necessa ry production materials and supply chain stability for example remain at the same high level as the previous year. see also the social and macroe conomic trends section.,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.2470620644093905,,,,,,
109,bayer annual report  a combined management report. opportunity and risk report marketing sales and distribution medium pharmaceuticals new product launches present particular challenges fo r our marketing and distribution organization since assumptions about aspects such as  the market and market circumstances may not materialize as anticipated. as a result product launch concepts  including those related to clinical trials  and the planning or implementation of the distribution strategy could turn ou t to be inefficient or inadequate in terms of scheduling. in addition if competitors ma

address these risks by conducting a forwardlooking analysis of possible scenarios and devising suitable strategies  for projects such as planned product launches. human resources medium group skilled and dedicated employees are essential for our co mpanys success. difficulties in recruiting hiring and retaining urgently needed specialized employees o n a regional level  also in view of competition between employers  and in employee development coul d have significant adverse consequences for our companys future development. developments such as  the growing relevance of disruptive technologies and the new operating model we inte nd to adopt together with new ways of working will require new innovative skillsets from our employees. based on ou r analysis of future requirements we counter these risks by designing appropriate empl oyee recruitment and development meas ures. in addition we align our corporate culture toward diversity an d employee needs based on data analyses and insights enabling us to tap the full potential of the employment market.  information technology high group our business and production proce sses and our internal and external  communications are dependent on global it systems. ensuring the optimal alignment of  our it architecture whic h also encompasses the use of cloudbased services and management of any serv ice providers commissioned therefore represents a challenge. this means that system reliability and the confidentiality of internal and external data are of fundamental importance to us. if our governance fails to adequately address this challenging environment our operational stability could negatively impact our business and our informatio n security requirements may not be met adequately. if the risk of a breach of data confidentiality inte grity or authenticity for example due to cyber attacks were to materialize it could lead to the manipulation andor uncontrolled outflow of data and knowledge and to reputational damage. such attacks may also be carried out by  inhouse personnel. our business andor production processes could also be temporarily disrupted by cyber attacks. to counter these risks we evaluate and utilize new technologies . projects and measures have also been implemented to keep technical security  precautions up to date an d proactively identify and examine new threats. in addition security measures  implemented by the corporate cyber defense center protect our it infrastructure  against unauthorized access. finance and tax medium group liquidity risk liquidity risks

143,bayer annual report  b consolidated fina ncial statementsnotes to the consolidated financial statements of the bayer group assets from expected product returns are recognized in inventories as rightofreturn assets at the previous carrying amounts less any recovery and pr ocessing costs and potential impairments. for unilaterally fulfilled customer contracts where more  than one year passes between performance and payment significant financing comp onents are accounted for separately based on their present values and the subsequent unwinding of the discount. the underlyin g discount rate takes into account the individual credit risk of the contracting part y that receives the financing. revenues from contracts involving noncash consideration such as exchange tr ansactions are measured at the fair value of the assets received or the right to receive them. some of the bayer groups revenues are generated on the basis of licensing agreements under which third parties have been granted the right to use or access products and te chnologies. a righttouse license is characterized by the underlying tec hnology remaining essentially unchang ed over the period for which the rights are granted. with a rightto access license by contrast the customer s interest is directed toward the consistent further deve lopment of that intellectual property. re venues from righttouse licenses are recognized at a specific point in time while those from righttoaccess licenses ar e recognized over time according to the underlying measure of progress. m ilestone payments relate d to righttoaccess licenses are allocated to satisfied and unsatis fied portions of the underlying pe rformance obligation as applicable. consideration relating to already satisfied obligations is recognized as catchup adjustments to revenue. payment elements still to be earned are deferred as co ntract liabilities. sales or usagebased royalties agreed in connection with outlicensi ng arrangements are only recogniz ed if the sale or the usage is sufficiently verified and the underlying pe rformance obligation has been fulfilled. in the crop science segment bayer conducts barter  transactions in certain geographies to grant its customers longer payment terms while at the same ti me reducing the credit risk. for example payment may be made in the form of a subsequent delivery of soybeans or corn or crops may be pledged as collateral. any commodityprice risk that bayer is ex posed to as a result is hedged using derivatives. changes in the fair value of these de rivatives are recognized in other operating income and expenses. if bayer assumes control of goods such as soybeans in stead of receiving a cash payment their resale is accounted for in other operating in come and their derecognition in other operating expenses since transactions of this nature do not form part of normal business operations. research and development expenses research expenses are recognized th rough profit or loss. development expenses are only capitalized as internally generated intangible assets if the recognition criteria of ias  intangible assets are met. these include sufficient certainty that the de velopment activity will give rise to future financial cash flows that also cover the respective development expenses. since ou r own development projects are often subject to regulatory approval proced ures and other uncertainties the condit ions for the capitalization of costs incurred before receipt of approval s generally are not satisfied.  development costs for internal so ftware projects can be capitalized . costs in connection with the implementation of cloud applications  are usually recognized through prof it or loss. if the definitions and recognition criteria of ias  are met which can be the case with interfaces fo r example the costs are capitalized as an intangible asset. capitalized de velopment expenses are recognized at the cost of generation and amortized over their expected useful lives. impairment testing is also performed on an annual or eventdriven basis. income taxes income taxes comprise the taxes levied on taxable in come in the individual co untries along with changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are recognized in profit or loss. this al so includes current income taxes resulting from tax laws that have come into fo rce or been adopted to implement the pillar two model rules published by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd. the income taxes recognized are reflected at the amounts likely to be payable under the statut ory regulations in force or already enacted in relation to future periods at the end of the reporting period. complex tax regulations may give rise to uncertainties with respect to their interpretation and the amounts and timing of future taxable income. given the wide range of internationa l business relationships and the longterm nature

205,bayer annual report  b consolidated fina ncial statementsnotes to the statements of financial position due to the short maturities of most trade accounts r eceivable and payable other financial receivables and liabilities and cash and cash equivalents thei r carrying amounts at the closing date do not significantly differ from the fair values. trade accounts receivable are measured at  fair value through other comprehensive income if they can potentially be trans ferred as part of factoring agreements. in case of a transfer all of the risks and opportunities contained in these agreements are transferred resulting in complete derecognition of the receivables. the fair values of financial assets and liabilities measur ed at amortized cost that  are given for information are the present values of the respective future cash flows. the present values are determined by discounting the cash flows at a closingdate interest rate taking into account the term of the assets or liabilities and also the creditworthi ness of the counterparty in certain  cases. where a market price is available however this is deemed to be the fair value. the fair values of financial assets measured at fai r value correspond to quoted prices in active markets level  or are determined using va luation techniques based on observab le market data as of the end of the reporting period level  or are the present values  of the respective future cash flows determined on the basis of unobservable inputs level . the fair values of derivatives for wh ich no publicly quoted prices exis t in active markets level  are determined using valuation techniques based on observable market data as of the end of the reporting period level . in applying valu ation techniques credit  or debt value adjustments are determined to account for the credit risk of the contractual party or bayer. currency and commodity forward contracts are measured  individually at their forward rates or forward prices on the closing date. these depend on spot rate s or prices including time  spreads. the fair values of interestrate hedging instrume nts and crosscurrency interestr ate swaps were determined by discounting future cash flows over the remaining terms of the instruments at market rates of interest taking into account any foreign currency translat ion as of the closing date in certain cases. fair values measured using unobservable inputs are ca tegorized within level  of  the fair value hierarchy. this essentially applies to certain debt or equity inst ruments in some cases to the fair values of embedded derivatives and to obligations for contingent consid eration in business combin ations. credit risk is frequently the principal unobservable input used to dete rmine the fair values of debt instruments classified as fvtpl  at fair value through profit or loss by  the discounted cash flow method. here the credit spreads of comparable issuers are applied. a significan t increase in credit risk could result in a lower fair value whereas a significant decrease co uld result in a higher fair value. however a relative change of  in the credit spread does not materially affect the fair value. when determining the fair values of contingent consid eration within the fvtpl nonderivative  at fair value through profit or loss category the principal unobservable input is the es timation of the probability that for example predefined milestones for research  and development projects will be achieved or that sales targets will be attained as well as the timing of the payments. changes in these estimates may lead to significant increases or decreases in fair value. embedded derivatives are separated from their respectiv e host contracts if the contracts do not represent financial assets and are not closely related to them. su ch host contracts are generally sale or purchase agreements relating to the operat ional business. the embedded derivati ves cause the cash flows from the contracts to vary with exchangerate or price fluctu ations for example. the internal measurement of embedded derivatives is performed using appropriate valuation models such as  discounted cash flow models which are based on unobservable inputs. the relevant models include planned sales and purchase volumes and prices derived from market da ta. regular monitoring is carried out based on these fair values as part of quarterly reporting.,0.2193990759273518,0.1887258597798632,0.2646619429263873,0.1646349236968164,0.2791417117907413,0.2072775694516655,0.3838570780701469,0.2742558664360588,0.2774546907986083,0.2329364618247202,0.3595503845738327,0.1917947968535758,0.2286632873517378,0.2834666957506725,,,,0.113987757274384,0.2188037279374539
