successfully provide positive impetus for sustain able and positive company development in the course of his activities on the supervisory board and that the supervisory board has made a particularly

operating ac tivities have proven to be especially valuable in ad vising and supporting the managing board in the fur ther development  of a fin ancially vi able su stainability  strategy for the
