legal regula tions on exports of military equipment   the federal republic of germany has one of the strictest export control systems in the world. german military equipment exports are governed by the grundgesetz  gg  german basic law the gesetz über die kontrolle von kriegswaffen  krwaffkontrg  german war weapons control act and the außenwirtschaftsgesetz  awg  foreign german trade and payments act in conjunction with the außenwirtschaftsverordnung  awv  german foreign trade and payments regulation. the poli tical principles adopted by the government of the federal republic of germany for the export of war weapons and other military equipment of june    provide the licensing authorities with guidelines.  european and german exports of military equipment  are being restricted by numerous bans licensing and reporting requirements at eu and national level. these restrictions allow the authorities to check critical exports and other foreign trade dealings with respect to arms control objectives. eu law takes  precedence over national law including german law. nonetheless according to article   tfeu treaty on the functioning of the european union all member states can take measures they consider necessary for the protection of their essential national security interests. decisions on the production of or trade in arms munitions and war materials are therefore up to the respective national lawmakers.  war weapons   article   of german basic law states that the manufacture transportation and marketing of war weapons requires a license from the german government. the details are specified in a federal law the german war weapons control act krwaffkontrg. an annex to the krwaffkontrg the war weapons list lists all items that are definitively regarded as war weapons. war weapons include not only devices such as battle tanks armored combat support vehicles and machine guns but also certain types of ammunition such as tank or artillery ammunition. as well as complete devices and ammunition systems cert ain assemblies and components such as the turret and chassis of a battle tank or the projectile warhead or fuse for certain types of ammunition are additionally defined as war weapons.  the krwaffkontrg includes an extensive licensing system for war weapon s. almost every activity relating to these goods requires a license. a license is required for the production of war weapons both during development and in series production. transfer of the actual control over war weapons also requires a license as does  the purchasing of these weapons. the transportation of war weapons within a country is also subject to licensing. moreover the transportation of war weapons using german ships or aircraft outside german territory requires a license. trading and brokerage  transactions involving war weapons that are not intended to affect german territory are also subject to licensing. above all the importing exporting and transit of war weapons requires a license. exporting a war weapon requires not only the applicable l icenses in accordance with the krwaffkontrg but also an additional license for export purposes

27,letter to shareholders  combined management report  consolidated financial statement  further information   basic information on the rheinmetall group     regulatory environment     rheinmetall  annual report   regulations on o ther military equipment   other types of military equipment are listed in part i section a of the export list an annex to the german foreign trade and payments regulation. in particular the export of these goods requires a license. the term goods and t herefore the export controls apply not just to goods but to technology and software as well. licenses are also needed for some types of technical support i.e. the transfer of intangible knowledge and capabilities and for some trading and brokerage trans actions. it is generally possible to import other types of military equipment without a license.  national regulations on trade and exports of military equipment   the federal republic of germany is entitled to restrict the foreign trade and  in particular   the export of military equipment including war weapons by imposing licensing requirements or bans for example to safeguard the material security interests of the federal republic of germany to prevent a disturbance to the peaceful co existence of na tions or a major disruption to the foreign relations of the federal republic of germany to safeguard the public order or security of the federal republic of germany or another member state of the european union or in the interests of the european union and in addition to implement the decisions of the european council on economic sanctions within the sphere of common foreign and security policy to carry out the obligations of the member states of the european union that are stipulated in directly applica ble binding acts of the european union on the imposition of economic sanctions in the sphere of common foreign and security policy and to implement resolutions of the united nations security council or intergovernmental agreements.  regulations on trade of  military equipment at eu level  the adoption of the council common position cfsp defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment of december    created a legally binding regime for all eu member st ates. the council common position of december    sets out a total of eight criteria for assessing export license applications. it gives mention to an eu common military list which largely matches the corresponding lists of controlled military equipm ent of the eu member states. controlled goods that come under these lists are largely defined and amended by the international export control regime. the wassenaar arrangement wa in particular governs the export controls of conventional military equipm ent and dual use goods and related technology. the australia group ag is active in the area of chemical and biological agents and dual use goods and technologies. furthermore the aim of preventing proliferation is pursued by the missile technology contr ol regime mtcr in the area of ballistic missiles and by the nuclear suppliers group nsg in the area of nuclear weapons. the goods in the respective item lists in the annex to the eu dual use regulation and german export lists are reflected in german la w.  international regulations on trade of military equipment   there has been a set of internationally applicable standards for the trade of conventional military equipment since the arms trade treaty att came into force in december . on april     the united nations general assembly approved a resolution by a large majority to adopt the text of the arms trade treaty. the treaty came into force on december   . a total of  countries have signed the treaty to date including germany.  deci sion of the german government on exports of military equipment   the german government makes decisions on exports of military equipment based on its political principles for the export of war weapons and other military equipment. these political principl es take into account the german war weapons control act and the foreign trade and payments act in conjunction with the european council common position of december    defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equi pment the arms trade treaty that came into force on december    and any respective subsequent regulations. the criteria laid down in the common position and any subsequent regulations form an integral part of these political principles. the principles on the export of military equipment from june    expressly prohibit the export of small arms and light weapons to third countries. licenses for these weapons and the associated ammunition are now issued by the federal government only in excep tional cases. if the political principles set out more restrictive measures than the common position they take precedence.  licenses for the export of war weapons and other military equipment are granted only on the basis of reliable prior knowledge of e nd use by the intended end user. this generally requires appropriate written assurance by the end user in the official end user certificate. the granting of licenses can additionally be made contingent upon the recipient country giving its consent to on site post shipment controls in line with the federal governments

91,letter to shareholders  combined management report  consolidated financial statement  further information   risks and opportunities     significant corporate risks     rheinmetall  annual report   focusing on technologically demanding market segments product innovations process improvements production and capa city adjustments and strict cost management all contribute to strengthening competitiveness in each of the companys industries and securing and building on the profitability of the rheinmetall group. in view of the technological progress in our industries  as well as the transformation of our former automotive business into a long term resilient and innovative civilian business we continue to strive to develop new markets and customer groups in the civilian industries and security segments. thanks to our b road international presence we can respond to market and demand fluctuations and balance out developments in individual regions and industries.  competition  rheinmetalls risk profile can also be negatively impacted by changes in the competition structure.  consolidation trends force competitors to merge and new competitors can emerge through technological innovations. in their industry and security policies some countries strive to create highly skilled workforces and a high degree of autonomy from import s. for us this means building up our own capacities by increasing the percentage of local value added. furthermore where competition is fierce we cannot rule out the possibility of being unable to achieve our margin targets. by systematically monitoring  the competitive environment rheinmetall is in a position to respond to these changes early on. international partnerships and systematic localization concepts are part of the groups strategy and together with technological market entry barriers serve to safeguard business.  technology and development  our innovative strength is a key success factor which we consider to be a driver of profitable growth. the future market position economic development and earnings situation of the rheinmetall group also depend on the ability to identify technological trends in good time correctly assess their impact on operational business to continually develop marketable new applications products and systems and to bring them to market maturity within a short period of time. the sometimes long development lead times continuously changing regulatory and technological framework conditions and intense competition are key factors contributing to the uncertainty regarding the economic success of current or future products . in particular the changes in the global security environment pose new challenges for germany the eu nato and nato equivalent states. the current complex security threats necessitate a systematic realignment of security and defence policy for the next decade and beyond. the turning point declared by german chancellor olaf scholz reflects these new security threats.  in this dynamic environment the rheinmetall group is a reliable partner that takes on responsibility and helps provide security by developi ng and expanding capacity in the short term particularly in the area of research and development. however the successful targeted and sustainable development of capacity will depend on consistent long term continuation of the course taken by the politic ians. only then can the planning security required for the process be established on a lasting basis. this particularly applies to the commitment to natos  target. the possibility of political reassessments of the priorities represents a potential risk to this development.  in addition rheinmetall continuously analyzes the technological developments that emerge particularly in connection with the ukraine war but also in other conflicts worldwide in order to identify potential capability gaps and elimina te these by way of targeted technological innovations. the fast pace of the developments observed also poses a challenge and necessitates rapid targeted decisions.  in addition to external factors and observations the rheinmetall group invests in research  development and innovation to develop new disruptive technologies and make them ready for use so as to ensure its own technological edge in the future too. to this end rheinmetall also leverages synergies between the defence sector and the civilian se ctor in a targeted way in order to benefit from new ideas innovative approaches and fast civilian innovation cycles.  the transformation of the automotive industry regarding alternative drive systems is leading to new challenges. global climate change in particular is encouraging a change in vehicle drives. the consequence of the corollary decline in vehicles with a combustion engine drive system is the declining market for classical products in the drive area for combustion engines such as pistons engin e blocks coolant pumps and also for components such as exhaust gas cleaning and aftertreatment. this transformation also generates potential as hybrid electric battery electric or fuel cell driven vehicles require electrically driven components and

transformation for drives it is particularly digitalization in vehicles which offers an opportunity to bring new products and product functionalities to the market. on the other hand this trend also harbors the risk that moving into digital technology and product segments requires high ex penditure in establishing expertise for development and production. furthermore it should also be taken into account that products with a high share of digitalization generally have shorter product life cycles which ultimately can result in high expendit ure for adjustments and thus amortization risks.  misjudgments regarding future market developments or the development of products systems or services that are not taken up by the market as expected as well as missed development deadlines fundamental ch anges in customer demand that were not foreseen or responded to adequately increased startup costs for new products or delays in launching innovations on the market can lead to a deterioration in our competitive and economic situation. however intensive market and competitor monitoring and analyses the market presence and customer proximity associated with international distribution structures as well as regular discussions with customers and suppliers make it possible for us to identify trends on the sa les markets in good time and to align product strategies consistently towards new requirements.  feasibility studies profitability analyses modern project management aimed at reviewing the criteria for technical and economic success bringing the sales a nd development units closer together the involvement of customers in the definition design development and testing of new products and safeguarding our technological position through property rights especially patents reduces possible rd specific ris ks such as misdevelopments and budget overruns.  thanks to a balanced mix of short  medium  and long term projects in a well filled research and development pipeline we are making advances in new markets and technological fields and in doing so further  safeguarding our technology positions. further information on research and development activities can be found under basic information on the rheinmetall group  research and development .  rheinmetalls focus  on developing new technologies and innovations outside the existing core business and bringing them to market maturity quickly is particularly on the technology segments of automation new sensor technology artificial intelligence ai and new mobility. the latter is particularly supported by targeted activities in the area of electromobility and hydrogen technologies. further details are presented in the research and development  chapter.  despite compliance w ith the processes and the use of state oftheart project management monitoring and controlling measures developing new products and launching new technologies and products entail risks in addition to changes to existing product portfolios. these exist n ot only in the actual design and development phase but also during market launch where startup costs may be higher than expected or unscheduled delays may arise. risks can also arise following market launch due to the potential need for technical improve ments which come to light only following use in real life situations or through continuous operation.  production and project implementation  rheinmetall counters potential production risks by applying high technical safety and process standards at its plants in line with the relevant risks. we ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for the product areas through internal policies and procedural instructions as well as by establishing applying and continuously improving management systems. our quali ty management systems have been certified in accordance with the internationally recognized iso  iatf  and aqap or en  standards for many years now for example. in addition methods including six sigma lean management and failure mode and e ffects analysis fmea are used to prevent quality risks. appropriate insurance cover is in place for warranty product liability and recall risks which is reviewed periodically and adjusted where necessary. wherever possible the management systems are run as integrated management systems meaning that the issue of quality is linked with other issues such as the environment health and safety and energy.  risks may arise from capacity bottlenecks due to staff shortages technical disruptions excessive sc rap levels lack of demand availability as a result of

ions reporting to the cpo in functional terms while there are also central units in procurement such as governance esg and commodity management that cooperate with the divisions. one key element for managing this area is the rheinmetall group purchasing  council rgp council. all divisions are represented on the rgp council in order to improve rheinmetalls market position with respect to suppliers and achieve better purchasing conditions. this ranges from optimized prices to improved payment and deliver y conditions. another objective of the rgp council is to transfer expertise and information and to ensure networking within the purchasing organization. furthermore regular exchanges in the rgp council ensure that the purchasing organization is adapted to  changing requirements and that both

94,letter to shareholders  combined management report  consolidated financial statement  further information   risks and opportunities     significant corporate risks    rheinmetall annual re port     bottlenecks in supply and sharp fluctuations in prices for raw materials involve significant risks. price risks for raw materials particularly aluminum copper and nickel are countered with cost esca lation clauses in contracts on the sales side. when procuring raw materials that are traded on the stock market the central commodities office manages the timing of purchases and the volume purchased in consultation with the operating units making use of financial hedging instruments.  an inadequate energy supply for the rheinmetall companies under cost efficient conditions constitutes a risk for competitive production at the sites. electricity and gas purchases in the rheinmetall group are made in advanc e on a rolling basis over several years based on the medium term planning. it is not possible to ensure complete hedging of fluctuations in the price of energy sources or to guarantee that increases in energy prices will be passed on to customers. however  we hold talks with our customers to make the development on the energy markets transparent and also to establish corresponding safeguard clauses. rising energy costs are addressed by bundling procurement volumes and through coordinated invitations to tend er long contract durations and optimization of the energy price via the european energy exchange in leipzig. germanys energy turnaround is expected to lead to the expansion of electricity grids and a significant increase in the share of renewable energie s. we believe that constantly rising electricity prices represent a risk  a development that could impact the international competitiveness of industrial companies. we have responded to this partly by investing in renewable energy generation ourselves now . crises such as geopolitical tensions or natural disasters pose a fundamental risk to supply chains. we counter these by increasingly endeavoring to ensure transparency in the supply chain and making risk minimized decisions on the basis of these insights . furthermore a cross disciplinary team was already set up in the previous year to respond quickly to changes in the situation and to prevent potential losses and damages due to disruptions in the supply chain.  in addition to general risks in our interna tional procurement activities country  and supplier specific risks may also arise. this includes for example child labor the conscious acceptance of environmental damage or inadequate safety and working conditions. as part of corporate social responsi bility  csr such risks are ruled out with business partner reviews. in  we introduced a system for analyzing human rights and environmental risks in our supply chain. this system forms the basis for the implementation of the german supply chain due diligence act at suppliers  . non financial aspects of business activities  a comprehensive easing of the situation on the global procurement markets still is not expected as the aftereffects of the covid  pandemic are continu ing and international capacity restrictions and bottlenecks in raw material procurement and energy supply continue to exist. the conflict in eastern europe means additional risks in relation to the security of existing supply chains. furthermore global su pply problems in the semiconductor market are ongoing. these can impact both procurement and sales. this is being counteracted with interdisciplinary teams the use of alternative and sound requirement forecasts. rheinmetall is also exposed to logistics ri sks. these manifest themselves as capacity fluctuations non compliance with transport lead times and even interruptions in the transport of goods for all modes of transport. these can have an impact on both transport costs and material availability.  human  resources  in a technology oriented group such as rheinmetall the implementation of the ambitious growth oriented corporate strategy the achievement of financial targets and the sustainable economic success hinges on a variety of staff including employe es with an above average level of qualifications and a number of experienced specialists from a wide variety of fields. having a high turnover of managers and employees in key positions can lead to a loss of key specialist knowledge and expertise. a shorta ge of skilled workers or not finding suitable management specialist and junior staff for vacant positions who have the desired commercial technical or industry specific skills or finding them only after a delay can also have negative repercussions fo r the company such as an aging workforce

electrical engineering throughout  the world. generally this situation will get worse as the pressure to innovate in the industry as a whole will increase.  capacity adjustments potential efficiency enhancement measures and possible restructuring or reorganization that may be necessary t o safeguard long term competitiveness often require a reconciliation of interests at operating level. we

constructively with employee representatives at our sites.  finances  rheinmetalls business situation financial position and performance are exposed to financial risks from operating activities. the main financ ial risks are liquidity risks counterparty risks and market price risks arising from changes in interest rates exchange rates or raw material prices.  liquidity risk is the risk that existing or future payment obligations cannot be met cannot be met on t ime or can be met only with excessive costs. to manage this risk all cash transactions are recorded assessed and centrally aggregated within the scope of corporate planning and rolling monthly twelve month liquidity plans. the values calculated are compa red with the available financial scope to identify any potential financing gaps early on.  scenarios such as catastrophe related sales slumps and payment defaults unexpected working capital requirements or reductions in credit facilities are simulated tak ing into account worst case scenarios. when determining the necessary financial scope rheinmetall takes great care to ensure that adequate reserves are held at all times.  counterparty risks arise in connection with deposits financing commitments or fina ncial receivables such as positive fair values from hedging transactions as a result of the relevant counterpartys inability to pay or insolvency. rheinmetall manages these risks through limit based creditworthiness linked and widely diversified lending  from commercial banks. financial transactions are conducted exclusively with banking or insurance partners that have an investment grade rating from recognized rating agencies or comparable credit ratings. moreover in the allocation of business emphasis  is placed on ensuring that in addition to sufficient diversification of the counterparties themselves diversification is pursued at country level as well.  default risks from the operating business can generally be assessed as low on account of the custo mer structure. in the case of large volume or long term business relations potential counterparty risks are individually analyzed and managed by means of prepayments milestone payments guarantees letters of credit or credit default swaps and special in dividual contractual frameworks. there are no customer or country dependencies that could jeopardize the continued existence of the rheinmetall group if they were to take a negative turn.,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3482182389992196,,,,0.1347238364057855,,
96,letter to shareholders  combined management report  consolidated financial statement  further information   risks and opportunities     significant corporate risks    rheinmetall annual re port     interest rate risks arise from volatility on the money and capital markets. these can occur in two forms. whereas fixed interest financial instruments can result in fluctuations in fair values and thus to valuation effects that are of relevance to earnings variable interest financial instruments are subject to a cash flo w risk as future interest payments can fluctuate in terms of their amount. both these forms tend to be of secondary importance for rheinmetall as the interest rates of the longer term debt instruments used are already fixed in the original contracts them selves while the cash flow risk from variable interest is offset by corresponding opposite cash positions in the group.  currency risks that rheinmetall is exposed to in its global business operations can also have an adverse effect on the operating result . here too the groups risk management unit should be involved early on in large volume projects or long term contract negotiations to prevent currency risks from occurring at all by formulating contract currencies or introducing cost escalation clauses.  moreover in currency management simulation calculations are performed to derive hedging strategies and use suitable derivatives that reflect the different business structures of the divisions. the currency risks are identified and assessed as part of re gular reporting.  similar to hedging against interest rate and currency risks risks from changes in prices are largely avoided in advance in contract negotiations for the procurement of raw materials or significantly restricted through the agreement of cos t escalation clauses. in cases where this is not possible derivative financial instruments are used. this is the case for example for industrial metals and the energy sector. the strategic management of market price risks is carried out at regular finan cial committee meetings in which the hedging decisions are made and documented.  regulatory or political interventions can impact the processing of international payment transactions. this would mean that either rheinmetall would not fulfill its contractua l payment obligations or would fulfill them only to a limited extent or it itself would receive cash receipts from exports incomplete or late. on the whole this risk should be classified as insignificant for rheinmetall and would be managed on a case bycase basis if it should ever occur.  taxes  tax risks can result from changes in the legal or tax structure of the rheinmetall group or from assessment periods that are still open. the differing assessment of circumstances during audits can lead to claims on  the part of the tax authorities. there is also a risk that the tax burden for the rheinmetall group may increase as a result of changes to tax legislation for individual countries or court decisions.  to identify and minimize tax risks at an early stage the rheinmetall group has set up a global tax compliance management system and taken organizational measures aimed at ensuring compliance with tax legislation. this system is developed on a regular and systematic basis.  legal  legal risks can arise in rela tion to competitors business partners or customers and as a result of changes to the legal framework in the relevant markets. not only is the group supported by detailed advice from its own specialist legal experts but it also depending on the case con sults external experts. furthermore potential losses damage and liability resulting from ordinary operations are wherever possible appropriately covered by insurance policies or corresponding accounting provisions.  our goal is to avoid litigation withi n the limits of what is economically reasonable. however it is naturally difficult to predict the outcome of pending legal and administrative proceedings in the majority of cases. costs can arise on the basis of adverse court or official decisions or the conclusion of settlements that are not covered or not fully covered by provisions or insurance policies and thus exceed the provisions that have been made. however after a thorough review we do not believe this will occur.  regulatory and legislative chan ges at national or european level may involve risks that could negatively affect our earnings situation. this applies for example to new laws and other amended legal frameworks e.g. relating to export controls or through export restrictions in practice . embargoes economic sanctions or other forms of trade restriction could be imposed on countries in which we operate by the european union the us or other countries or organizations.,0.1693294049707983,,,,,,,0.2944271956119758,0.2408628184704248,,0.4146153682560178,0.1851165950611317,,0.3371650679483216,,,,0.1286885970397291,

 in the course of a highly dynamic sustainability debate the communicative presentation of a medium  and long term corpora te strategy based on responsible action is crucial for the perception and acceptance of the company by a broad public. protecting and building a positive reputation as a central task of communications is considered essential in order to continue to be reco gnized and commissioned as a supplier and equipment provider to the public sector and to be able to survive on the money credit and capital markets. in particular the impact of our communications and other image building measures on the general media p ublic determines how we are perceived by politicians administrators and business and financial players.  environmental social governance  sustainability risks non financial risks differ in part from traditional risk assessments in terms of the timescal e considered the assessment of their impact but also in perspective. for this reason the process for sustainability risk reporting builds on the existing risk management modules but goes beyond them in parts. potential sustainability risks are identifi ed and assessed both at group level and in the divisions as part of the risk management system.  in addition to the safety of our products protecting our employees and the environment and respecting and safeguarding human rights in our own business activit ies and in business relationships along the value chain are high priorities. misconduct and non compliance with legal requirements or the groups own standards may have effects such as personal injury environmental property and reputational damage produ ction downtime and interruptions to operations and the obligation to pay damages. this also includes the risk of releasing hazardous substances as a result of a failure in production the obligation to remove contamination and risks from the area of comp liance with human rights and from potentially addressing these insufficiently. with our principles standards and measures we ensure that our requirements are communicated appropriately and implemented in the best possible way.  if we do not comply with th e increasing regulatory requirements and fail to meet the expectations and requirements of governments customers investors lenders and other financial institutions in the areas of environmental and social responsibility and governance esg to the requi red extent or level of detail this can have a negative impact on the rheinmetall groups business and earnings. customers could potentially refuse to award contracts to us private and institutional investors might refuse to include us in their portfolio  and financial institutes might refuse to issue loans at all or only at an increased cost. we counter these risks through comprehensive and transparent esg reporting based on globally recognized standards such as the global reporting initiative and  where  possible  through continuous improvement of our customer and esg ratings from internationally renowned agencies and institutions e.g. msci iss esg sustainalytics vigeoeiris esg book cdp and ecovadis.  furthermore the passing of legislation or regu lations for the finance sector could cause institutional investors to restructure their portfolios and reduce or terminate their exposures in companies that operate in industries classed as critical. possible sector exclusions e.g. for the weapons and def ence industry could also limit our options to raise capital. changes to the qualification criteria for being accepted to or remaining on stock indices could also harbor risks for our company.  business activities that touch on sensitive esg topics could re sult in a negative response among stakeholders or trigger negative media reports which could damage our reputation and jeopardize the achievement of our business goals. this impact could potentially be exacerbated by insufficient crisis communication.  the protection of human rights is an integral part of our social responsibility and anchored in our group guidelines such as the code of conduct the supplier code of conduct the principles of social responsibility and the policy statement in accordance wit h the german supply chain due diligence act. rheinmetall aims to prevent the negative consequences of its business activities and in the supply chain impacting its ability to uphold human rights. it is a matter of course for us to identify human rights ris ks including environmental risks associated with our business activities and sphere of

99,letter to shareholders  combined management report  consolidated financial statement  further information   risks and opportunities     significant corporate risks     rheinmetall  annual report   with   locations worldwide  we are subject during our everyday business to a wid e range of legal and regulatory requirements any of which can be updated developed or made stricter at ever shorter notice. this applies in particular to provisions relating to not only the environment chemicals hazardous substances and critical raw materials but also occupational and health protection. it also includes regulations relating to air soil and water pollution and waste disposal all of which have recently been made stricter by new legislation particularly in the european union and the us . adapting to new requirements could increase operating costs or require unscheduled investments. a whole range of different licenses and approvals are also required for our locations and factories and their provisions have to be met which are subject to renewal amendment suspension and revocation by the issuing authority. violations of relevant official regulations that apply to how we exercise our business activities or infringement of social occupational safety and environmental standards could har m rheinmetalls reputation and subsequently result in internal or external investigations requirements remediation obligations claims for damages and under certain circumstances substantial fines or penalties. we actively counter these risks in variou s ways including through high technical standards integrated management systems and certification in accordance with international standards such as iso   iso   and iso  . we evaluate measures that go above and beyond compliance with legal r equirements on a cost  benefit basis. although we have organizational structures and procedures in place to ensure that we comply with applicable government regulations in the conduct of our business it cannot be entirely ruled out that violations of appl icable government regulations could occur on our part or on the part of third parties with whom we have a contractual relationship and whose actions could be attributed to us.  a large amount of land owned by the rheinmetall group has been subject to indus trial usage for decades. for this reason it cannot be ruled out that contamination  for example as a result of production processes or processes to test munitions  has also been generated during this time that rheinmetall is not yet aware of. accounting  provisions have been recognized for necessary measures to safeguard against or clean up identified pollution. the elimination of leaks or the clean up of effects resulting from technical failure could give rise to direct costs for the company. it is possi ble that the relevant authorities may issue regulations that require costly clean up measures. we counter potential environmental risks by implementing statutory environmental standards certified environmental management systems proper and safe storage o f hazardous substances and environmentally friendly disposal of waste and hazardous materials via certified service providers. at our different locations special organizational units ensure that the relevant legislation and regulations are observed and t hat further technical options for mitigating environmental risks are identified. the tightening of environmental protection provisions and environmental standards could lead to additional unplanned costs and liability risks over which rheinmetall would hav e no influence. for certain environmental risks we have taken out liability insurance policies with coverage amounts that we consider customary and appropriate for the industry. losses could be incurred from environmental damage that exceed the insured am ounts or are not covered by insurance.  risks attributable to climate change are currently already beginning to emerge. these can be chronic and acute physical risks such as the rise in average temperature rising sea levels extreme weather events sharply  fluctuating water levels increasing heat waves and droughts affecting property. with regard to production sites production interruptions delivery delays or delivery failures represent significant risks. these may be exacerbated by more intense and freq uent extreme weather events such as tornadoes and severe flooding. transitory risks from climate change arise from cross sector structural change due to the transition to a lower carbon economy. they relate in particular to changes in the legal framework a nd tighter limits at national or transnational level. these include for example increasing efforts by legislators to introduce co  pricing via emissions trading systems to levy additional taxes and to tighten energy legislation. furthermore rheinmetalls emissions balance and intensity could lead to a negative perception and limited attractiveness among stakeholder groups such as customers and investors. climate protection measures also entail financial risks for example due to increased energy and investment costs emerging levies for co  emissions or extended specifications for products. to identify and better assess risks from climate change more reliably rheinmetall carried out a comprehensive site specific assessment on its production sites again in the year under review using database content from a renowned service provider in accordance with the parameters of the task forc e on climate related financial

related information. audits and the implementation of corresponding awareness measures are therefore essential.   potential risks associated with business trips and business stays abroad e.g. health risks and security risks through criminality or terrorism are countered primarily through preventive measures. the latest information concerning the security situation in the destination countries is thoroughly  evaluated and appraised potentially resulting in travel warnings or even travel bans being announced by the groups management. to provide our employees with not only detailed security

furthermore divestments of individual business units in the civilian sector have also been driven forward as part of active portfolio management. in fiscal  rhei nmetall completed the sale of its large bore piston business to the swedish group koncentra verkstads ab. in addition rheinmetall and comitans capital ag signed the acquisition agreement for the entire small bore business area on december  . the pu rchase agreement covers rheinmetalls small bore piston business with all production sites where business operations and production are to be continued in the future. the parties are aiming to close the transaction which is still subject to approval by t he relevant authorities as of march  .  at the beginning of  rheinmetall acquired a majority interest in the military vehicle manufacturer automecanica media  srl in romania in which it will hold . of the shares via rheinmetall landsysteme  gmbh in future. the other shares in the company will remain with private owners. the closing of the corresponding contractual agreement is still subject to approval by the relevant authorities. the company will operate in romania as rheinmetall automecani ca srl. with this acquisition rheinmetall is building further on its position as a leading manufacturer of military vehicles and strengthening its activities in central europe in line with its strategic orientation.  in accordance with strategic requiremen ts and guidelines transactions are subjected to an analysis of opportunities and risks through standardized processes such as extensive due diligence procedures and are assessed on the basis of yieldrisk considerations. when necessary we involve externa l experts and consultants in the transaction processes. furthermore we ensure that contracts are designed in a way that is commensurate with the risk in particular by obtaining warranties of specific properties or guarantees and by agreeing purchase price mechanisms and liability clauses or taking out appropriate insurance policies. despite a careful approach it is always possible that some acquisitions do not ultimately come to fruition  for example due to regulatory obstacles. following approval proc eedings carried out over several stages the executive board andor depending on whether the transaction volume exceeds defined value thresholds the supervisory board of rheinmetall ag decide on the implementation of the acquisition or divestment project . acquisitions always harbor business risks because they inherently entail a range of imponderables arising from the integration of new employees technologies products and processes. the integration process could for example prove to be more difficult  time consuming and cost intensive than originally expected. we have put in place the structures and processes required for ensuring the smooth integration of companies and work for example according to a standardized post merger concept. our many years of experience with the successful integration of companies also serve us well.  it may also be the case that the acquired company does not fare quite as well following integration as was originally hoped or that the targets synergy potential and cost savings that the acquisition was expected to bring about are not or only partially achieved. in addition risks can arise in connection with the activities of newly acquired companies that were either not previously known or not considered significant. acqui sitions can also negatively impact the debt ratio and financing structure and lead to an increase in assets and divestments including goodwill. difficulties may result primarily from impairments of goodwill due to unforeseen business developments. further more such transactions may well result in considerable

105,letter to shareholders  combined management report  consolidated financial statement  further information   risks and opportunities     opportunity management     rheinmetall  annual report   in the portfolio there are already a large number of innovative high tech solutions for the armed forces of tomorrow. examples include ai supported assistance systems for soldiers on deployment complex simul ation solutions autonomous system solutions for interference free and fully automated communication or drone defence systems. to supplement its automation portfolio rheinmetall is developing autonomous and remote controlled unmanned ground and air system s which are supplemented for the battlefield on the basis of digitalization solutions. with the acquisition at the beginning of  of a  share in blackned gmbh a specialist in mission critical communication systems in the field of digitalization and networking of land forces rheinmetall is further expanding a its leading role as a partner for the digitalization of armed forces. with this strategic partnership rheinmetall will be in an even better position in the future to implement the end toend na ture of the tactical information and communications network as well as the chains of effect within the system network.  opportunities due to fleet renewal  vehicle systems is well positioned to participate successfully in the tenders for major european mili tary vehicle programs in the medium to long term. before the outbreak of the war between russia and ukraine we anticipated demand for around  medium weight and heavy tracked vehicles in germany and for approximately  in europe. for light  and medi umweight wheeled vehicles as well as medium and heavy protected wheeled and tracked vehicles we estimated demand in germany and europe at over  units. oversees particularly in australia and the usa we estimated more than  additional tracked vehicles and at least the same number of protected wheeled vehicles. there is also strong growth in demand in the artillery sector. an increase in tactical vehicles also requires adjustment of the associated necessary logistics. it is therefore no surprise  that demand for allterrain military trucks is also rising exponentially. with regard to logistics vehicles there are upcoming fleet regenerations comprising several tens of thousands of units particularly on the european markets and in the us. in the m arkets relevant for rheinmetall we forecast market potential for military vehicles of well over  million over the next few years. against the backdrop of the war in eastern europe this potential and the underlying vehicle unit figures are likely to i ncrease further.  opportunities due to consolidation of the defence market  other growth opportunities may arise for rheinmetall as a result of the expected ongoing consolidation process in the european defence market. these may occur as a result of targeted  acquisitions of products andor technology or on the basis of company acquisitions allowing more rapid regional market access.   opportunities due to conventional drives  the combustion engine is subject to increasingly stringent national and internationa l regulations regarding the emission of pollutants especially climate damaging carbon dioxide. this will require ever more complex solutions and in turn additional and more sophisticated components. rheinmetall offers a large range of innovative and com petitive components and systems which take account of these rising demands. these include divert air valves wastegate actuators and pressure control valves for exhaust gas turbochargers as well as specially coated plain bearings and engine blocks and var iable oil coolant and vacuum pumps.  opportunities due to expertise in lightweight construction  in parallel with the transition toward electromobility lightweight construction methods will play an increasingly important role. rheinmetall offers a wide ran ge of

in th e security and defence industry  supply chains in the defence industry are characterized by very complex structures easily comprising up to eight stages for the needs of for example rheinmetall waffe munition and rheinmetall landsysteme. the high proport ion of specific materials and processes combined with a broad product range leads as is generally the case in this industry to a high proportion of single sourcing also because only a few companies throughout the world completely manufacture or command the very specific products and processes. in the defence technology industry switching to new suppliers is very costly both from a financial and time related perspective. the qualification of products carried out by military authorities is linked not onl y to the performance of the product itself but also to the manufacturing process manufacturing location and suppliers. a change of suppliers therefore automatically results in costs for requalification. the procurement business in the area of ballistic pr otection has the characteristics of a project i.e. it is characterized by intermittent production by our suppliers. this requires a high number of quality assurance measures. furthermore specific legislation such as the war weapons control act the fore ign trade and payments act the international traffic in arms regulations itar to cite just a few must be taken into consideration for procurement in the divisions operating in the security technology sector.  we provide information on relevant risks in  the risks and opportunities  section.  social

rheinmetall is a liv ing breathing part of society and participates actively in it and not just in a financial sense. we get involved in the areas of education sport and culture and also provide direct support for local social projects and charitable organizations. by adding  value locally we also contribute to regional development. flourishing production sites do not only mean attractive highly skilled jobs and training places close to home but also orders for local suppliers and service providers. in addition a large part  of the sales generated by the companies returns to the

team and the protection systems business unit worked on further development of the digital product passport dpp in the year under review. the dpp is intended in particular to drive forward the circular economy and enable new digital business models. for example information on components materials repairability and reuse as well as usage data is stored individua lly for each product in digital form. key players along the value and supply chain can access this data via a unique identifier and decide how a used product can be optimally fed into further value creation from an economic and ecological perspective repa ir reuse recycle etc.. rheinmetall has been actively involved in an initiative of the european defence agency eda on this topic. as part of the incubation forum for circular economy in european defence  ifceed rheinmetall is participating in stud ies on the digital product passport in the defence sector.  the development of environmentally friendly solutions for materials is not only being driven forward in the civilian sector of our business activities such as in materials and trade as part of the  substitution of lead containing materials. defence is also working on the materials portfolio to identify suitable alternatives to chromium containing coatings for individual parts for example. in the year under review material and trades launched a project to replace lead with a lead free alternative material . human rights due diligence obligations  protecting human rights in our own company and in the supply chain is an important priority of

report   eu taxonomy  . sustainable finance  sustainable finance means taking account of environmental social and governance esg considerations when making investment decisions  in the finance sector which should lead to longer term investments in sustainable economic activities and projects. in addition to climate change mitigation the ecological aspects also include adapting to climate change and environmental factors such as  preserving biodiversity avoiding pollution and the circular economy. social parameters may for example relate to issues of inequality working conditions investments in local communities and human rights. the management of public and private sector companies and institutions  including management structures relations between employers and employees and the remuneration of managers and employees  plays a crucial role when it comes to including social and environmental considerations in decision making processes.  one important measure of the european union was therefore the definition of the eu taxonomy which is intended to establish a shared understanding of the environmental sustainability of economic activities and capital expenditure. the start ing point for defining an economic activity as environmentally sustainable is the six environmental objectives of the eu taxonomy regulation  climate change mitigation  climate change adaptation  sustainable use and protection of water and mari ne resources  transition to a circular economy  pollution prevention and control and  the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. the eu taxonomy distinguishes between taxonomy eligible economic activities which correspond to  the pure description of a category and thus do not have any significance to sustainability. economic activities are considered environmentally sustainable and thus taxonomy aligned if they make a substantial contribution to one or more of these defined en vironmental objectives do not significantly harm the achievement of any environmental objective do no significant harm principle  dnsh and comply with minimum safeguards for  occupational health and safety and human rights such as those arising from the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises or the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights. all corporate activities that cannot be assigned to any category are taxonomy noneligible.  based on these complex screening criteria the extent to which products and individual measures are ecologically sustainable as defined in the eu taxonomy regulation is specified. since the publication of delegated regulation eu  by the eu commission in june  on environmental objecti ves  to  sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources transition to a circular economy pollution prevention and control protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems these are now available for all six environmen tal objectives defined in the eu taxonomy regulation. in addition to the delegated regulations on the technical screening criteria for the six environmental objectives the eu taxonomy regulation stipulates another delegated regulation on the taxonomy related disclosure obligations in accordance with article  of the eu taxonomy regulation which contains more detailed provisions on content methodology and presentation.  . method of determination  the recording of taxonomy relevant economic activities was carried out using a decentralized top down approach. the organizational structure of the rheinmetall group was the guiding principle here so the screening and allocation of economic activities took place at division level as well as at the level of the rh einmetall ag rheinmetall real estate rheinmetall it solutions and rheinmetall technology center business units. as part of this the determination was divided into three phases identification of relevant category sets allocation of economic activities  taxonomy eligibility and taxonomy alignment testing.  the categories were identified for all six environmental objectives. a comprehensive assessment was carried out for the final delegated regulation published by the eu commission in june  on the e nvironmental objectives  sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources  transition to a circular economy  pollution prevention and control and  protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems . on this basis the relev ant categories with the associated criteria sets were identified and all non applicable categories were excluded. for environmental objective  climate change adaptation no economic activity was identified in the allocation of economic activities phas e. as in previous years this was therefore not taken into account. similarly no economic activity could be identified for the environmental objective  sustainable use

vehicles. these are simulators for specific vehicles that are ordered by the customer instead of training vehicles. standard simulators designed  for multiple vehicles were not included as in this case the comparative solution would have been another simulator. in the case of standard simulators verification of greenhouse gas savings is not possible.  manufacture of automotive and mobility

this involves the implementation of construction projects for residential and nonresidential buildings for the groups own account  for resale or on a fee or contrac t basis. for construction of new buildings comprehensive climate protection requirements must be taken into account for building permits in accordance with statutory regulations. rheinmetall immobilien gesellschaft mbh is also committed to more far reachi ng ecological and economic measures in several projects. for example certifications in accordance with the german sustainable building council dgnb  which go beyond the

statement of financial position under which these liabilities are reported. furthermore disclosures must be made with regard to the ranges of the payment terms for these financial liabilities and for compar able trade payables that do not form part of such finance arrangements with suppliers. as a result of the amendments to ifrs   information on liquidity risk must also be provided for supplier finance arrangements.  the amendments to ias   establish regul ations that can be used to determine whether two currencies are exchangeable with one another and how the exchange rates are to be determined if a currency is not exchangeable. a currency is considered to be exchangeable if a company can exchange this curr ency into another at the measurement date on markets or using exchange mechanisms. if a company can only obtain an immaterial amount of the other currency then a currency is not exchangeable into another currency. in this case the closing rate is estimat ed by the company. this is to be done using the rate that would have applied to a properly executed transaction between market participants and which would reflect the prevailing economic conditions.  the application of the new and amended standards and in terpretations is not expected to have a material effect on the presentation of the rheinmetall groups net assets financial position and results of operations.   accounting policies  the key accounting policies and measurement principles applied to rheinmeta ll ags consolidated financial statements are described below.  cost  cost includes the purchase price and all incidental costs that can be directly with the exception of company acquisitions as defined by ifrs  and financial instruments measured at fai r value attributed to the purchase. in the event of an exchange cost equals the fair value of the asset given in an exchange of assets transaction as of the date of the exchange whereby any cash compensation is accounted for accordingly.  cost includes a ll expenditures that are directly attributable to the production process and an appropriate share of production related overheads. the latter comprise material and production overheads including production related depreciation and social security expenses as well as pro rata administrative costs. overheads are allocated to production costs on the basis of the production facilities normal capacity utilization.  financing costs are capitalized as costs if they relate to assets which are produced or purchased over a period exceeding one year.  grants and allowances  government grants provided for the acquisition of an asset are deducted from the corresponding capital expenditures. any government grants for expenses for purposes other than investment activities  are recognized as deferred income and amortized to profit via other operating income when the related expenses are incurred. private investment related grants from customers are also recognized as deferred income and amortized to profit over the contract term. if economic ownership of the subsidized asset is transferred to the customer sales are recognized on the date of the transfer.  impairment  if there are indications of impairment on an asset or a cash generating unit cgu and the recoverable amoun t is less than the amortized cost an impairment loss is recognized. if indications for impairment cease to exist impairment losses are reversed with the exception of goodwill. the reversal cannot exceed the value of amortized cost that would have result ed if no impairment had been charged.  goodwill  goodwill in the amount of the potential benefit is allocated to the cash generating units at the level of which management monitors goodwill. it is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment once a year at the end of the reporting period and during the year if there are indications of impairment. the impairment test compares the carrying amount to the recoverable amount. fair value less costs to sell determined applying the discounted cash flow metho d based on the current corporate planning is used as the recoverable amount. if this value is below the carrying amount a check is made as to whether the value in use results in a higher recoverable amount. if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable a mount impairment is

200,letter to shareholders  combin ed management report  consolidated financial statement  further information    notes to the consolidated financial statements     summary of accounting principles   rheinmetall annual report     investment property is carried at cost less cumulative depreciation and impairment. depreciation is recognized on a straight line basis over a useful life of  to  years.  financial instruments  the first time recognition of financial instruments is at fair value. in the case of a financial asset that is n ot measured at fair value through profit or loss incidental costs are included on first time recognition. standard market purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized for the first time on the settlement date. this is the date when the financial  instrument is delivered or the payment is made. notwithstanding this derivatives are recognized for the first time as of the date when the contract is concluded or the trading date.   there are three measurement categories for the subsequent measurement o f financial instruments  measurement at amortized cost  measurement at fair value through other comprehensive income fvoci and  measurement at fair value through profit or loss fvtpl. the relevant measurement category for a financial instru ment depends on the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset and the entitys business model for managing financial assets.  if the contractual cash flows comprise solely payments of principal and interest sppi and the business model i s hold financial instruments are measured at amortized cost. financial instruments with sppi cash flows but the hold and sell business model are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. if the sppi criterion is not met the financial  instruments are likewise measured at fair value but the changes in value are recognized through profit or loss. in the case of debt instruments changes in value can be recognized through profit or loss despite fulfillment of the sppi criterion by exerci sing the fair value option. currently there are no situations in which the fair value option is used for debt instruments. in the case of equity instruments the fair value oci option provides the opportunity to recognize any changes in value that arise th rough other comprehensive income.  trade receivables and liquid financial assets are generally measured at amortized cost. trade receivables classified by group companies as available for sale must be measured at fair value through other comprehensive inco me. other financial assets measured at amortized cost are discounted by applying rates that match their maturity on first time recognition and written down using the effective interest method. as of the end of the reporting period the default risk of fina ncial assets is checked and if necessary an impairment recognized on the basis of expected losses. for trade receivables the simplified method is used applying the customer credit rating and specific country risks. the loss allowance for expected defaul t risks is recognized in the income statement.  cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortized cost. cash and cash equivalents comprise any liquid assets with a remaining term of less than three months at the date of their purchase.  changes in the fair  value of derivative financial instruments are recognized in the income statement. if the conditions under ifrs  are met they are accounted for as cash flow hedges. the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the designated derivative is re cognized in equity in the hedge reserve. the cumulative changes in fair value are reclassified from equity to the income statement if the hedged item is recognized in the income statement. changes in the fair value attributable to the ineffective portion o f the hedge are always recognized in the income statement.  financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.  compound financial instruments  rheinmetall has issued a compound financial instrument in the form of a convertible bond. provided certain criteria are met the convertible bond grants the holder the right to convert it into a certain number of shares.  on initial recognition the liability component of the compound financial instrument is recognized at the fai r value of a similar bond without a conversion right. the equity component is recognized in the amount of the difference between the fair value of the total compound financial instrument and the fair value of the liability component. directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the debt and equity components in the ratio of their carrying amounts on initial recognition.,0.2446676627507316,,,0.3145630331787717,0.3606772029812869,0.3001367750774267,0.3927404778960843,0.3331003642009739,0.2827207694198409,0.2947424861583271,0.5064930839992273,0.3335918594000506,0.2665858701870061,0.3529855449639174,0.2796568305275614,0.2499078696875888,0.1413326053548163,0.1755813473085729,0.2858691421188227

rheinmetall  annual report   the liability component is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. by contrast the equity  component remains unchanged during the term of the compound financial instrument. when exercising the conversion right at the end of the term the liability component is transferred to equity without any effect on profit or loss.  the interest incurred in connection with the compound financial instrument is recognized through profit or loss.  inventories  inventories are carried at cost usually using the weighted average. inherent risks due to reduced utility or to obsolescence are adequately allowed for.  if the net realizable value of inventories is lower than their carrying amount as of the end of the reporting period they are written down to net realizable value. the write down is recognized either as cost of materials raw materials and supplies or a  change in inventories of finished products and work in progress. if the net realizable value of inventories previously written down increases the ensuing reversal is routinely offset against cost of materials raw materials and supplies or recognized as  a change in inventories of finished products and work in progress.  assets held for sale and associated liabilities in discontinued operations  a discontinued operation is a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that either is  held for sale or has already been sold and is clearly distinct from the entitys other operations both from a business perspective and for the purposes of financial reporting.   a discontinued operation classified as held for sale in accordance with the cr iteria of ifrs  is recognized in the consolidated financial statements under discontinued operations. at the reclassification date the discontinued operation is stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. depreciation and am ortization are suspended from the reclassification date. assets and liabilities that are not within the scope of the measurement requirements of ifrs   are measured in accordance with the standards applicable to them. the elimination entries for transactio ns between continuing and discontinued operations are assigned in full to discontinued operations. in reporting the activities of the discontinued operation are not assigned to a reportable segment.  assets and liabilities of discontinued operations are re classified to the assets held for sale and liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale items in the statement of financial position. the previous years statement of financial position items are not reclassified. in the income statement the earnings after taxes of the discontinued operations are combined in a separate item as earnings from discontinued operations. the previous years figures in the income statement are restated accordingly. the statement of cash flows continues to compr ise the cash flows of the entire group and is supplemented by an of which item for the net cash flows of discontinued operations.  contract assets and contract liabilities  contract assets are recognized in connection with contracts with customers if in  the case of contract manufacturing the cumulative sales recognized over time exceed the sum of the advance payments received and progress billings. as of the end of the reporting period this asset item is tested for impairment and if necessary an imp airment is recognized on the basis of expected losses. if the recognized sales are lower than the sum of the advance payments received and progress billings a contract liability is recognized. a contract liability is also recognized if advance payments ar e received and consideration has not yet been provided.  deferred taxes   deferred taxes are recognized for temporary measurement differences between items shown in the statement of financial position under ifrs and according to the local tax laws of the in dividual companies. deferred tax assets also include the tax assets receivable from the expected future utilization of tax loss carryforwards if their realization is reasonably certain. deferred taxes are calculated on the basis of the tax rates applicab le or announced in each country as of the end of the reporting period.  income tax liabilities are recognized on the basis of appropriate estimates for obligations to the respective national tax authorities that are uncertain in terms of amount and probabil ity of occurrence. the tax rate specific to the company effective at the end of the reporting period is used. other factors are also taken into account such as experience from previous external audits and different legal interpretations between taxpayers and the tax authorities with regard to the issue at hand. uncertain income tax items are recognized at the most likely amount.,0.1861268816680934,,0.3764359967785177,0.2902965448273351,0.4122754194628323,,0.4525921419321363,0.333009274375742,0.2584807419167763,0.2982810653808776,0.4169997866736739,0.3096671331527181,,0.3875934153289032,0.2687963136044566,0.1971391306185855,0.1472297014230097,0.1501583144144453,0.3738991088663477

position   rheinmetall annual report     account any plan assets. there are material pension plans at the rheinmetall groups german and swiss companies and at rheinmetall bae systems land ltd. in the united kingdom.  rheinmetall has restruc tured the defined benefit plan for group companies based in germany effective january   . it comprises a basic plan and a corporate performance related intermediate plan each of which is financed by the employer and a supplementary plan financed thr ough deferred compensation. the supplementary plan is subsidized by an employer contribution of  to the deferred compensation amount for deferred compensation up to  of the west assessment ceiling in the statutory pension scheme. the respective pl an components are paid into a fund managed by a trustee. the beneficiaries are entitled to the amounts derived from the plan assets. there is also a nominal contribution guarantee. the agreed retirement benefits comprise old age pensions invalidity pensio ns and pensions for surviving dependents. the pension capital is paid out in the form of a life long pension payment in installments over  years or a lump sum. as agreed the life long pension and the payment in installments are increased by  each ye ar. the defined benefit plan that applied for group companies based in germany until the end of fiscal  likewise consisted of three elements a basic plan and a corporate performance related intermediate plan each of which was financed by the employer  and a supplementary plan financed through deferred compensation. the agreed retirement benefits comprise old age pensions invalidity pensions and pensions for surviving dependents. the annual pension contribution or the amount of deferred compensation f or each beneficiary in accordance with actuarial principles is converted into a capital component. the total pension capital when benefits become due is based on the sum of all capital components. for the basic plan and intermediate plan pension capital i s paid out in the form of a life long pension that increases by  each year in accordance with an agreement. for the supplementary plan financed solely by the employee the pension capital is paid out as a lump sum or in three or five equal installments w hen benefits become due. when the new plan was introduced the previous plan was converted to the new pension plan. the entitlements from the previous pension plan remain in place.  other pension plans exist in germany but these are no longer available to  new employees joining the group. the agreed retirement benefits comprise old age pensions invalidity pensions and pensions for surviving dependents. depending on the plan these are based on agreed fixed amounts per year of service or on a percentage of the employees final salary before leaving the rheinmetall group. ongoing retirement benefits are subject to compensation for inflation.  the pension obligations of the german companies are largely financed internally. rheinmetall has set up a contractual t rust arrangement cta with the aim of spreading the financing of its pension and partial retirement obligations across several pillars over the long term. for continuing operations a total of  million has been paid into a fund managed by a trustee si nce   million of which was allocated to pension obligations and  million to partial retirement obligations. pension payments to the beneficiaries are made by the respective group companies.  there are pension plans at the swiss subsidiaries eac h of which is managed via pension funds for several companies multi employer plans. these are defined benefit plans used to cover pensions and risks arising from invalidity and death for former employees their relatives and surviving dependents. on reti rement the pension is based on the available retirement assets multiplied by conversion rates determined by pension fund regulations whereby payment can take place monthly or in certain cases as a lump sum. pension plans are financed by contributions mad e by the employer and employee primarily at a rate of  each which are paid into pension funds. the pension funds are independent foundations that do not belong to the rheinmetall group whose funds are due solely to pension beneficiaries. any return o f assets and income to the contributing companies is excluded. the top bodies in the foundations comprise equal numbers of employer and employee representatives of the relevant companies. the foundations are responsible for investments. principles of secur ity risk distribution yield and liquidity must be observed in this process in order to be able to render the agreed benefits from the foundations assets when due. both contributions paid into the pension funds and future benefits arising from these are reviewed regularly by the foundations bodies and may be changed after taking into account the foundations financial options. in the event of a shortage of cover the pension funds can levy remedial contributions from all associated employers if other mea sures do not lead to the desired result. liability of the swiss subsidiaries towards the companies belonging to the pension funds is excluded. at one swiss

264,letter to shareholders  combined management report  consolidated financial statement  further information     notes to the consolidated financial statements      rheinmetall annual report     b during our audit we obtained an understanding of the method applied to carry out the impairment tests evaluated the determination of the weighted cost of capital and assessed the ca lculation method in consultation with our internal valuation specialists and on the basis of the understanding we had obtained of the processes. for the purpose of risk assessment we obtained an overview of the business development of the divisions in the  reporting year and assessed to what extent the valuation could be influenced by subjectivity complexity or other inherent risk factors. we examined whether the corporate planning underlying the impairment tests is consistent with the corporate planning p repared by the executive board and acknowledged by the supervisory board. in assessing the quality and reliability of the corporate planning we compared the planning of the previous fiscal years with the results that were actually realized and analyzed any deviations adherence to the plan. together with the persons in charge we discussed the assumptions and premises underlying the planning and examined them for plausibility. for this purpose we among other things reconciled the assumptions made with macroeconomic and industry specific market expectations. we also assessed whether the future cash flows had been appropriately derived from the assumptions and premises made. in addition our audit included an examination of whether the cost of group funct ions has been properly considered in the impairment testing of the respective cash generating units. we audited the reallocation of the goodwill previously recognized at the level of the vehicle systems division to the two new cash generating units vehicle  systems europe and vehicle systems international based on calculations of the relative values.  as relatively small variations of the discount rate used may already have material effects on the value of the recoverable amount thus determined we assessed t he parameters that were relied on for determining the respective discount rate including the cost of capital and verified that they were within the normal market ranges. in each case we assessed the appropriateness of calculation of the measurement sche me for determining the recoverable amount. furthermore due to the material significance of goodwill for the groups assets and liabilities we performed a complementary sensitivity analysis in order to be able to assess a possible impairment risk in case of a potential change of material assumptions concerning the valuation parameters. in

the company as at december    an amount of  million is recognized as revenue in the statement of profit or loss of which  million was recognized according to the percentage of completion method. a material part of the activities in the business with security technology is realized under long term customer specific agreements. the balance sheet as at december   shows contract assets and contract liabilities of  million and  million respectively. revenue from long term customer specific agreements is gen erally recognized over the period in which the relevant asset was created unless the rheinmetall group has an alternative possibility to use the asset and is legally entitled to receive payment for the services already rendered. also if an asset is create d or enhanced and the customer gains control over the asset as the asset is created or enhanced revenue is recognized over a period of time. when recognizing revenue over a period of time revenue is recognized according to the percentage of completion w hich is calculated as the ratio of the actually incurred contract cost to the estimated total cost to complete the contract.  from our point of view recognizing revenue over a period of time is subject to a considerable risk of material misstatements due t o fraud or error and is therefore of particular importance in the context of our audit. estimates by the management have a significant impact on the determination of the percentage of completion the expected total cost and the cost of orders that is stil l to be incurred until completion including any contract risks and their probability of occurrence. due to new evidence obtained on the cost development and changes in the ordered project scope over the multi year terms of the contracts and the rendering of the services revenue estimated contract cost and completion of the contract may sometimes deviate considerably from the original project calculation.,0.1786049163726789,,,,,,,,,,0.3468223001029516,,,0.2903950192524231,,,,0.1093323556074684,

provided by the executive board on revenue recognition please refer to the sections accounting policies and sales in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  b during our audit we consulted the parts of the underlying contracts relevant to accounting and evaluated the process of proper identification of the performance oblig ation and classification of satisfying the performance obligation over a given period of time. for the purpose of risk assessment we obtained an overview of the business development in the reporting year and assessed to what extent the revenue recognition  could be influenced by subjectivity complexity or other inherent risk factors. based on the understanding we have obtained of the processes we evaluated the design of identified internal controls relevant to the audit and ascertained whether they had be en established. we focused our audit of these control procedures on the controls for approval of the project valuation taking into account the percentage of completion and the projected project margin. to the extent that we relied on identified controls w e also assessed the effectiveness of those controls.  we evaluated the appropriateness of the project calculation and the assessment of the percentage of completion by means of long term customer specific agreements that were selected based on risk based aspects. the key criteria for the selection of our project spot checks were the amount of the total contract value and of the contract volume the revenue realized with the project in the year under review as well as the development of the project margin or  its amount in the year under review. in addition some contracts were randomly selected on a sample basis. besides gaining an understanding of the underlying parts of the contract our audit procedures included inquiries of the project management the div ision management and the executive board into the development of the projects the current evaluation of the expected cost still to be incurred until completion as well as the estimate of the probability of occurrence of contract risks and opportunities. m oreover we reconstructed the proper recognition and netting of direct cost as well as the amount and netting of overheads. in the case of estimates made by the management we assessed the reasonableness of the methods applied the assumptions made and th e data used.  in addition we audited the completeness and correctness of the corresponding disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  . accounting treatment of the acquisition of expal systems s.a.u.  a the acquisition of the spanish mun itions manufacturer expal systems s.a.u. madrid spain that was agreed with maxamcorp holding s.l. madrid spain was completed on july  . the purchase agreement for the acquisition of all shares had already been signed by both parties in novembe r of the previous year. with this acquisition the rheinmetall group is particularly aiming to increase its available production capacity in the areas of artillery mortar and medium caliber ammunition and to expand its product portfolio. the acquired comp any will in future operate as rheinmetall expal munitions s.a.u. and has been allocated to the weapon and ammunition division. the provisional purchase price due on completion of the acquisition amounts to . billion.  the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at the acquisition date at the fair values determined in a purchase price allocation by an external expert commissioned by rheinmetall. intangible assets totaling  million were recognized in this purchase price allocation  million of which was attributable to the authorization granted by the spanish government for the possession and processing of explosive substances. in addition hidden reserves were identified in the acquired companys non current assets in a considerably lower amount. the portion of the purchase price that was not allocated to the assets and liabilities in the purchase price allocation amounts to  million and is recognized as goodwill in the statement of financial position.  the accounting treatment of the acquisition of expal systems s.a.u. was particularly important in the context of our audit as no market values were available for the identified intangible assets in particular meaning that complex assumption based valuation models and methods were used to determine their fair values. the result of the valuation is highly dependent on the forecast of future cash flows and the discount rates used and is subject to uncertainty due to the scope of discretion for the executive board. in addition there i s a risk that the disclosures in the notes required under ifrs   may not be complete or
