5,combined management report   . financial performance system  . revenue growth  in the siemens financial framework we aim to achieve a revenue growth range of  to  per year on a comparable basis over a cycle of three to five years. our primary measure for managing and controlling our revenue growth is comparable growth because it shows the development in our business net of currency translation effects which arise from the external environment outside of our control and portfolio effects which involve business activities which are either new to or no longer a part of the respective business.  currency translation effects are the difference between revenue for the current period calculated using the exchange rates of the current period and revenue for the current period calculated using the exchange rates of the comparison period. for calculating the percentage change yearoveryear this absolute difference is divided by revenue for the comparison period. a portfolio effect arises in the case of an acquisition or a disposition and is calculated as the change yearoveryear in revenue related to the transaction. for calculating the percentage change this absolute change is divided by revenue for the comparison period. any portfolio effect is excluded for the twelve months following the relevant transaction after which both current and past reporting periods fully reflect the portfolio change. for orders we apply the same calculations for currency translation and portfolio effects as described above.  . profitability and capital efficiency  within the siemens financial framework we aim to achieve over a cycle of three to five years margins that are comparable to those of our relevant competitors. therefore we have defined profit margin ranges for our industrial businesses which also consider the profit margins of their respective relevant competitors. profit margin is defined as profit of the respective business divided by its revenue.  for our industrial businesses profit represents ebita adjusted for amortization of intangible assets not acquired in business combinations.  we have set the following margin ranges              margin range  digital industries      smart infrastructure      mobility      siemens healthineers        siemens financial services roe after tax                for siemens healthineers we present the margin range we expect as that companys majority shareholder.  in line with common practice in the financial services business our financial indicator for measuring capital efficiency at sfs is return on equity after tax or roe after tax. roe is defined as sfs profit after tax divided by its average allocated equity.  primary measure for managing and controlling profit and profitability at group level net income is the primary driver of basic earnings per share from net income eps as well as of eps before purchase price allocation accounting eps pre ppa which is used for our capital market communication. eps pre ppa is defined as basic earnings per share from net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and related income taxes. as with eps eps pre ppa includes the amounts attributable to shareholders of siemens ag. we aim to achieve highsingledigit annual growth in eps pre ppa over a cycle of three to five years.  we seek to work profitably and as efficiently as possible with the capital provided by our shareholders and lenders. for purposes of managing and controlling our capital efficiency we use return on capital employed or roce as our primary measure in our siemens financial framework. our goal is to achieve a roce within a range of  to  over a cycle of three to five years.  . capital structure  sustainable revenue and profit development is supported by a healthy capital structure. accordingly a key consideration within the siemens financial framework is to maintain ready access to the capital markets through various debt products and preserve our ability to repay and service our debt obligations over time. our primary measure for managing and controlling our capital structure is the ratio of industrial net debt to ebitda continuing operations. this financial measure indicates the approximate amount of time in years that would be needed to cover industrial net debt through income from continuing operations without taking into account interest taxes depreciation and amortization. we aim to achieve a ratio of up to ..  . liquidity and dividend  we intend to continue providing an attractive return to our shareholders. in the siemens financial framework we strive for a dividend per share that exceeds the amount for the preceding year or at least matches it.  as in the past we intend to fund the dividend payout from free cash flow. our primary measure to assess our ability to generate cash and ultimately to pay dividends is the cash conversion rate for the siemens group defined as the ratio of free cash flow continuing and discontinued operations to net income. over a cycle of three to five years we aim to achieve a cash conversion rate of  minus the annual comparable revenue growth rate.  at the annual shareholders meeting the managing board in agreement with the supervisory board will submit the following proposal to allocate the unappropriated net income of siemens ag for fiscal  to distribute a dividend of . on each share of no par value entitled to the dividend for fiscal  existing at the date of the annual shareholders meeting the remaining amount is to be

7,combined management report   . segment information  . overall economic conditions  overall calendar  was characterized by many headwinds for the global economy. global economic development continued to slowly recover from the negative shocks of the previous years the coronavirus pandemic covid with its disruptions on global demand and supply chains war in ukraine and the following commodity price explosions especially for european energy spiraling inflation and severe financial tightening which caused some turbulence in the banking sector and financial markets. after calendar  in which global gross domestic product gdp increased by . calendar  is expected to show global gdp increasing by . which shows a remarkable resilience of the global economy given the number of big negative shocks of the previous year.  in the postpandemic world consumption patterns of households continued to normalize. in particular the shift to goods from services triggered by covid ended and then reversed with a strong rebound of the service sector including tourism and a normalization of goods demand. in addition in light of much higher interest rates many firms started to reduce their inventory levels which they had previously elevated as a precautionary measure to ensure production and delivery during periods of supply chain bottlenecks. accordingly both global goods demand and trade were significantly weaker in calendar .  these trends were primary contributors for the significant slowdown of the chinese economy during calendar  after it started very dynamically in the first quarter of calendar  following lifting of severe covid lockdowns. another main contributor for the slowdown was the intensification of the countrys real estate crisis. hence chinas gdp is expected to grow by only  in calendar  which is regarded as low because under multiple lockdowns in calendar  china delivered gdp growth of only  and some catchingup in  was expected.  the u.s. economy was a positive surprise. although monetary policy was substantially tightened and the main policy interest rate was increased to . consumption and investment were strong and gdp is expected to expand by . in calendar . in particular the labor market was robust and unemployment remained at historic lows. despite the strong economy inflation and core inflation rates declined substantially. by end of calendar  consumer price inflation is expected to be approximately  after it reached nearly . at the end of calendar . receding global commodity and energy prices and the dissolvement of supply chain bottlenecks both helped ease inflation while tighter monetary policy had the desired effect of anchoring inflation expectations. this helped the u.s. avoid a pricewageprice spiral which could have led to structurally higher inflation rates.  while the u.s. showed stronger economic growth than expected the european union e.u. experienced the difficulties that were widely expected. the drastic increase of energy prices in calendar  a result of the war in ukraine had a severe negative impact especially on energyintensive industries. strong increases in inflation rates led the european central bank to increase the main policy interest rate to . which weighed on fixed investment especially in the real estate sector. moreover the global manufacturing and trade slowdown mentioned above weighed on the e.u. due in particular to the high concentration of manufacturing and export industries in germany the regions largest economy. gdp growth in calendar  is expected to be . in the e.u. and . in germany. only the service sector in particular tourism supported the overall e.u. economy.  the partly estimated figures presented here for gdp are based on an sp global report dated october  .  . digital industries  digital industries  offers a comprehensive product portfolio and system solutions for automation used in discrete and process industries these offerings include automation

industry the food and beverage industry and the electronics and semiconductor industry. digital industries serves its customers through a common regional sales organization spanning all its businesses using various sales channels depending on the type of customer and industry and also enhancing customer choice across all channels. changes in customer demand especially for standard products are driven strongly by macroeconomic cycles and can lead to significant shortterm fluctuation in digital industries profitability. volume from large contracts in the software business particularly for eda may also result in strong fluctuations in quarterly volume and profitability. in fiscal  digital industries continued to transition parts of its software business particularly plm from largely upfront revenue recognition towards software as a service saas which yields more predictable recurring revenue and offers growth opportunities by opening access to new customers especially small and mediumsized companies seeking to reduce costs associated with owning complex it infrastructure. the transition held back revenue growth rates and profit margin development in the software business in fiscal  and digital industries expects continued impacts until completion of the transition. competition with digital industries business activities comes primarily from multinational corporations that offer a relatively broad portfolio and from smaller companies active only in certain geographic or product markets.  digital industries sees three trends  influencing its business and providing longterm growth opportunities. producers of investment goods in todays increasingly digital environment must modernize their production capacity particularly to increase production flexibility and reduce time to market. this environment also spurs producers to complement their core products with vertical solutions and service,0.1603825889697117,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.1228430803648589,

cloud hpc which provides instanton rapidly scalable cloudbased high performance computing for complex simulation studies hosted on amazon web services and industrial edge management system for kubernetes clusters which addresses it users in production and aims to save it resources energy and costs. major investments  of digital industries in fiscal  relate to its own factory automation motion control and process automation businesses to further automate and digitalize facilities particularly in germany china and singapore.        fiscal year   change  in millions of       actual  comp.  orders          revenue          therein software business         profit         profit margin  .  .      following extraordinary demand in fiscal  which included proactive customer purchasing orders  at digital industries came in lower in its automation businesses. the shortcycle factory automation and the motion control businesses were affected most strongly due particularly to destocking at customers. these declines were partly offset by significant growth in the software business due to large contract wins in both the plm and the eda businesses. revenue  rose on increases in all businesses due in part to conversion from the order backlog which had expanded significantly in the previous fiscal year. the strongest revenue growth contributions came from the factory automation and the process automation businesses. overall growth in the automation businesses was supported by improved availability of components yearoveryear. revenue growth in the software business was led by the eda business while yearoveryear growth in plm was held back by the transition to saas. on a geographic basis orders remained stable in the americas region but came in lower in the region europe c.i.s. africa middle east and in the region asia australia due mainly to weaker demand in china. revenue grew in all regions with the strongest contribution coming from the region europe c.i.s. africa middle east. profit  and profitability at digital industries rose on strong improvements in all automation businesses supported by higher capacity utilization and a more favorable business mix including improved availability of components for highmargin products. profit in the software business declined due to increased expenses related to cloudbased activities including severance charges which for digital industries overall rose to  million up from  million in the prior year.  at the beginning of fiscal  business activities in the areas of lowvoltage and geared motors and motor spindles previously part of digital industries motion control business were transferred to portfolio companies. if the transfer to portfolio companies had already existed at the beginning of fiscal  digital industries would have posted orders of . billion revenue of . billion profit of . billion and a profit margin of .. at the beginning of fiscal  digital industries order backlog amounted to  billion of which  billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal .  in fiscal  markets  served by digital industries overall grew significantly. however after a strong start growth momentum increasingly slowed over the course of the fiscal year. this was particularly evident in china. on a geographic basis all regions contributed to growth led by the regions americas and europe c.i.s. africa middle east. while global supply chain constraints eased high price inflation led central banks to increase interest rates which together with high energy costs impacted manufacturing industries. this impacted predominantly consumer and buildingrelated industries whereas production of investments goods still benefited from converting high order backlogs into current revenue. the entire manufacturing industry experienced a destocking of inventories as a countereffect of proactive ordering in the previous fiscal year. this was most evident in distributor channels and resulted in a significant decline in orders for automation equipment. discrete industries which are closer to consumer spending than process industries were impacted earlier and more strongly than process industries which are more projectbased. the global automotive industry recovered throughout the year following a weak prior year and benefited from improved supply chain conditions. production of electric vehicles continued to increase. on a geographic basis china japan the u.s. and countries of the european union saw a strong catchup of production mainly in the first half of the fiscal year. the machinebuilding industry grew strongly in the first half of fiscal  but growth in major countries such as china germany japan and countries of the european union came to a halt or market volume even declined in the second half of the fiscal year due to less favorable investment conditions caused by rising interest rates and a more cautious investment sentiment in consumer industries. within the pharmaceutical and the chemicals industries the pharmaceutical industry grew throughout the fiscal year but with slower momentum towards the end of the fiscal year. in contrast production in the chemicals industries declined in fiscal . this was particularly evident within the countries of the european union due mainly to high energy costs. the food and beverage industry grew strongly at the beginning of the fiscal year driven by strong price increases. in the second half of the fiscal year growth slowed considerably reflecting weaker consumer spending. the market for electronics and semiconductors declined markedly at the beginning of fiscal  but began to stabilize during the second half of the fiscal year. the decline which was particularly evident in countries such as taiwan and korea with a focus on semiconductor production was due among other factors to shrinking consumer,,,0.3079552616767226,,,,,,,,,,0.3684990479521324,,,,,0.1130644111675022,

while industrial software markets are expected to grow clearly shortcycle markets served by digital industries are expected to contract slightly. among other factors rebalancing of supply chains trade conflicts effects from geopolitical tensions cautious consumer spending and downsizing of inventories mainly in distribution channels are expected to weigh on market growth.  . smart infrastructure

10,combined management report   smart infrastructure showed very strong performance in fiscal . orders  increased clearly compared to the high prioryear level which included proactive purchasing by customers. growth was mainly driven by the electrification business and included a number of larger contract wins from data center semiconductor power distribution and battery manufacturing customers. revenue  rose in all businesses with the strongest growth contributions coming from the electrification and the electrical products businesses. on a geographic basis orders and revenue rose in all three reporting regions. the strongest growth contribution came from the americas region driven by the u.s. while growth in the asia australia region was held back by declines in china which were due mainly to negative currency translation effects. profit also rose in all businesses. growth in profit and profitability was driven by the electrical products and the electrification businesses due to higher revenue by increased capacity utilization and by cost reductions achieved through the execution of smart infrastructures competitiveness program. severance charges were  million up from  million a year earlier. at the end of fiscal  smart infrastructures order backlog was  billion of which  billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal .  overall markets  served by smart infrastructure grew clearly in fiscal . market dynamics were influenced by a further recovery from covidrelated effects easing of supply chain and logistics constraints which resulted in shorter lead times for order fulfillment strong price inflation and effects from the war in ukraine. furthermore rising interest rates burdened building construction markets. on a geographic basis all reporting regions contributed to growth. price inflation affected all regions and was particularly high in the u.s. while on the one hand rising interest rates impacted growth in the u.s. economic activity was boosted by stimulus programs on the other hand. in china the recovery from lockdown measures was significantly weaker than expected which also impacted growth dynamics in other countries while europe was most strongly affected by the war in ukraine and high energy prices. grid markets grew clearly driven by demand for integration of energy from renewable resources. industrial markets also grew clearly on strong demand in the battery semiconductor and automotive industries. the buildings market overall also grew but activity in the commercial building market rose only moderately. in fiscal  markets served by smart infrastructure are expected to grow clearly but at a slower pace than in fiscal  due to a substantially lower effect from price inflation and a cooling of the general economic environment. while growth is expected to be weak in residential and commercial building markets and in some industrial markets continued robust demand is expected for data centers and power distribution. overall market development in fiscal  is expected to continue to be influenced by rebalancing of supply chains trade conflicts and effects from geopolitical tensions.  . mobility  mobility  combines all siemens businesses in the area of rail passenger and rail freight transportation. within its rolling stock business its offerings encompass vehicles and selected components for urban and regional transport such as metro systems trams and light rail and commuter trains as well as trains and passenger coaches for intercity and longdistance services such as highspeed rail. rolling stock offerings furthermore include locomotives and solutions for automated transportation such as automated people movers. offerings in its rail infrastructure business include products and solutions for rail automation such as automatic train control systems interlocking operations control and telematic systems digital station solutions and railway communication systems signaling onboard and signaling crossing products and yard and depot solutions and for electrification such as ac and dc traction power supply contact lines and network control. with its service business mobility provides maintenance and digital services among others for rolling stock and rail infrastructure throughout the entire lifecycle. in its turnkey business it bundles consulting planning financing construction service and operation of complete mobility systems. mobilitys software business comprises train planning systems trip planning mobile ticketing mobility as a service maas platforms ondemand transportation and fleet management data analytics and inventory and reservation management.  mobility sells its products systems and solutions through its worldwide network of sales and execution units. the principal customers of mobility are public and stateowned companies in the transportation and logistics sectors so its markets are driven primarily by public spending. customers usually have multiyear planning and implementation horizons and their contract tenders therefore tend to be independent of shortterm economic trends. large contracts in the rolling stock and the rail infrastructure business are often awarded together with service contracts which start to generate revenue only after the respective products and solutions have been put in operation which can be a number of years after the contract award. mobilitys principal competitors are multinational companies. consolidation among mobilitys competitors is continuing and may lead to increased competitive pressure within the rail transport industry and also to fewer sourcing options for rail customers.  the main trends  driving mobilitys markets are urbanization decarbonization and digitalization. increasing populations in urban centers need daily mobility that is simpler faster and more flexible reliable and affordable. at the same time cities and national economies face the challenge of cutting co  and noise emissions and reducing space requirements and costs of transportation. the pressure on mobility providers to meet all these needs is expected to rise continuously. furthermore improving availability connectivity and sustainability of rail infrastructures increasingly requires digital solutions which generates growth opportunities for providers of such solutions. iot systems and new softwarebased solutions such as maas are expected to become major growth enablers for the rail industry. overall trends towards urbanization decarbonization and digitalization persist and many countries have been allocating significant funds to rail and public transport operators to address these trends.  mobilitys rd strategy  is focused on reducing lifecycle costs of rail infrastructure and rolling stock securing system availability increasing network capacity of rail infrastructure optimizing the processes of rail operators and improving passenger experience. with siemens xcelerator mobility intends to make software more modular and increasingly move it to the cloud. at the same time mobility intends to enhance connectivity of hardware and software and provide

development is driven partly by staff shortages societys increasing resistance to healthcare costs the growing professionalization of health insurance and governmental healthcare systems burdens from chronic diseases and the rapid scientific progress. the growing cost pressure will continue to drive new remuneration models for healthcare services such as valuebased reimbursement instead of treatmentbased reimbursement. as a result of these factors theres a trend of consolidation of healthcare providers into networks. the aim of the resulting larger clinic and laboratory chains often operating internationally and acting increasingly like large corporations are systematic improvements in quality while at the same time reducing costs. this development leads to an increased demand for standardized and scalable systems and solutions as well as new business models.  rd activities  at siemens healthineers are aimed at offering innovative and sustainable solutions for diagnostics

the imaging and varian businesses in particular delivered growth in both orders and revenue this was offset by a substantial decline in the diagnostics business. on a geographic basis revenue was on the prioryear level in all regions in the asia australia region reported revenue was held back by negative currency translation effects. profit  declined primarily due to substantially lower revenue from rapid coronavirus antigen tests in the diagnostics business which also recorded charges of . billion related to its transformation program. in addition profitability was burdened by impairments and other charges totaling . billion due to a management decision to refocus certain activities in the advanced therapies business. the imaging and varian businesses increased their profit contributions on higher revenue. severance charges were  million in fiscal  compared to  million a year earlier. the order backlog for siemens healthineers was  billion at the end of the fiscal year of which  billion are expected to be converted into revenue in fiscal .  in general the addressable global markets  of siemens healthineers excluding rapid coronavirus antigen tests grew moderately in fiscal . from a regional perspective the asia australia region saw market growth in most businesses in china government subsidy programs among others including the program of lending incentives associated with the economic stimulus package had a positive effect on investment by healthcare providers. in the region europe c.i.s. africa middle east government subsidy programs among others were able to support growth in most businesses. in the u.s. market growth was recorded in all businesses. globally higher volume in the market for the imaging business was generated thanks to the high level of order backlogs resulting from demand catchup effects on the one hand and investments in diagnostic imaging equipment in reaction to announced price hikes on the other hand. the imaging market is expected to grow moderately overall in fiscal  driven mainly by pentup demand for the major imaging modalities. within the diagnostics business demand for rapid coronavirus antigen tests declined sharply after the covid pandemic ceased to be a global health emergency and the incidence of covid infections subsided. the market for the diagnostics business is expected to achieve slight growth in fiscal  excluding covid testing. in the market for varian overall market growth especially in the u.s. and western europe was boosted mainly by increasing demand for product innovations and services as well as by an intact replacement market. for this reason the market for varian is expected to grow clearly in fiscal . for advanced therapies business government subsidy programs including lending

services for different industries including oil and gas chemical mining cement logistics energy marine water and fiber. unrealized potential within these businesses requires adjustment in their approach using defined measures including internal reorganization digitalization cost improvements and optimizing procurement production and service activities. after achieving certain threshold performance targets businesses may be combined with another business in the same industry sold placed into an external private equity partnership or exited via a public listing.  at the end of fiscal  portfolio companies consisted mainly of three separately managed units large drives applications offers electric motors converters and mining solutions. siemens logistics offers sorting technology and

carveout these activities remained so far with siemens due to countryspecific regulatory restrictions or economic considerations.  demand within the industries served by portfolio companies mainly shows a delayed response to changes in the overall economic environment. financial results are strongly dependent however on customer investment cycles in their key industries. in commoditybased industries such as oil and gas or mining these cycles are driven mainly by commodity price fluctuations rather than changes in produced volumes. the heterogonous industrial customer base of the separately managed units requires a dedicated sales approach based on indepth understanding of specific industries and customer requests resulting in the use of various sales and marketing channels

21,combined management report   . overall assessment of the economic position  overall global economic development in fiscal  was mixed and characterized by a number of headwinds. in this environment siemens delivered a very strong performance in all its businesses due to its strategic positioning relative to longterm trends such as automation electrification and digitalization. with our offerings we help increase resource efficiency and the decarbonization of industry transport and building infrastructures and make manufacturing more resilient and flexible. we expect these trends to continue to drive our growth in the coming years.  during fiscal  we made further progress in focusing our business portfolio by selling our commercial vehicles business. furthermore we began forming a new motors and large drives company under the name innomotics by combining our existing business activities in the areas of low to highvoltage motors geared motors mediumvoltage converters and motor spindles. also we further reduced our stake in siemens energy ag to . and transferred shares to siemens pensiontrust e.v. to boost future growth and drive innovation we announced a  billion investment strategy mainly for new manufacturing capacity as well as innovation labs and education centers. we also expanded our open digital business platform siemens xcelerator by introducing industrial operations x which includes a broad range of interoperable offerings for more adaptive production and by adding new cloudbased applications for building x our suite for smart and sustainable buildings.  fiscal  was another very successful year for siemens. we achieved excellent financial results in a volatile market environment which on the one hand included destocking by customers and distributors following previously proactive purchasing particularly in our shortcycle businesses and on the other hand included improved supply chain conditions which accelerated revenue conversion from our high order backlog. we raised our outlook during the fiscal year after the first and the second quarters. we then reached or exceeded all the targets set for our primary measures for fiscal . we achieved revenue growth of  net of currency translation and portfolio effects and delivered eps pre ppa of .. excluding siemens energy investment eps pre ppa was .. roce increased to . our capital structure ratio came in at . and the cash conversion rate was ..  orders rose  yearoveryear to . billion for a booktobill ratio of . thus fulfilling our expectation of a ratio above . order growth was driven by sharply higher volume from large orders at mobility including an order worth . billion for locomotives and associated maintenance in india and a . billion order for the first line of a turnkey rail system in egypt and by clear growth in smart infrastructure led by the electrification business. orders in digital industries came in lower as the destocking trend mentioned above had a significant effect on its automation businesses.  revenue was higher in nearly all our industrial businesses and rose to . billion up  yearoveryear. smart infrastructure and digital industries contributed doubledigit growth with all businesses posting increases. revenue growth at smart infrastructure was led by the electrification and the electrical products businesses while at digital industries the factory automation and the process automation businesses contributed the strongest growth. revenue growth at mobility was led by a significant increase in the rolling stock business. revenue at siemens healthineers remained on the prioryear level as growth particularly in the imaging and varian businesses was offset by a decline in the diagnostics business. excluding currency translation and portfolio effects revenue for siemens rose . we thus exceeded the forecast provided in our combined management report for fiscal  which was to achieve comparable revenue growth in the

earlier and rose  to . billion. all industrial businesses except siemens healthineers increased their profit yearoveryear. the strongest increase came from smart infrastructure on improvements in all its businesses led by the electrical products and the electrification businesses. growth at digital industries was driven by the automation businesses only partly offset by a decline in profit in the software business due mainly to higher expenses related to cloudbased activities. profit at mobility increased in nearly all businesses and included positive trailing effects related to the winding down of business activities in russia a year earlier. profit at siemens healthineers came in lower on declines in the diagnostics business due primarily to sharply lower revenue from rapid coronavirus antigen tests as well as charges related to its transformation program and charges related to refocusing certain activities in the advanced therapies business.  the profit margin of our industrial

remarkable resilience in calendar  given the number of headwinds and negative economic shocks from the previous year. nevertheless these shocks still have adverse implications for economic growth in calendar  especially the dampening effects of tighter financial conditions. accordingly in calendar  the global economy is expected to further slow down to . gdp growth after . in calendar . given the high number of active and potential geopolitical conflicts the outlook is subject to a high level of uncertainty.  in the e.u. gdp is expected to increase by . in calendar  after an anticipated growth of . in calendar . the effects of the energy crisis still show negative impacts especially in energyintensive industries. tighter monetary policy  the european central bank lifted the main policy interest rate to . in just over one year  also held back growth particularly in the construction industry. the german economy is most impacted due to its proportionally large manufacturing sector and

longerterm interest rates also increased substantially  will unfold their full effect next year. hence a short and shallow recession during calendar  while not our baseline assumption is also possible

continue to weigh on gdp growth. during calendar  global goods demand world trade and industrial production are expected to modestly increase again. the main assumption behind this expectation is further normalization for two critical factors consumer spending and the inventory policies of companies. both weighed on industrial output in calendar  but are expected to modestly support growth of the chinese economy in calendar . in addition chinese private consumption is expected to drive domestic demand and some tailwinds will come from announced stimulus measures.  globally the decline of inflation rates is expected to continue although at a slower pace. past interest rate hikes are having the desired effect and headline inflation is expected to steadily approach the central bank targets. hence monetary policy is expected to become less restrictive in calendar .  global fixed investments should benefit from government programs and from factory investments to improve supply chain resilience and other diversification measures. global gross fixed investments are expected to grow by . in calendar  unchanged from . in the year before.  given the forecasted further slowdown of the global economy growth of markets served by siemens is also expected to slow in fiscal  in light of significant headwinds few tailwinds and reduced stabilizing effects from high industrys order backlogs and price adjustments in a number of our businesses.  the forecasts for calendars  and  presented here for gdp and fixed investments are based on a report from sp global dated october  .  .. siemens group  we are basing our outlook for fiscal  on the abovementioned expectations and assumptions regarding the overall economic situation and also on the specific market conditions we expect for our respective industrial businesses as described in chapter  segment information. furthermore we assume that geopolitical tensions do not further increase. we expect improvements in productivity and adjusting prices for our own products solutions and services to more than offset effects from wage increases and higher prices for raw materials and components.  we are exposed to currency translation effects mainly involving the u.s. dollar the british pound and currencies of emerging markets particularly the chinese yuan. siemens is still a net exporter from the eurozone to the rest of the world so a weak euro is principally favorable for our business and a strong euro is principally unfavorable. while we expect volatility in global currency markets to continue in fiscal  we have improved our natural hedge on a global basis through geographic distribution of our production facilities in the past. in addition to the natural hedging strategy we also hedge currency risk in our export business using derivative financial instruments. we expect these steps to help us limit effects on income related to currency in fiscal . in this outlook we assume that currency translation effects in fiscal  slightly reduce nominal volume growth rates for siemens and profitability of our businesses.  this outlook excludes burdens from legal and regulatory matters.  segments  digital industries expects for fiscal  comparable revenue development of  to . this is based on the assumption that following destocking by customers global demand in the automation businesses especially in

25,combined management report   .. enterprise risk management process  we have implemented and coordinated a set of risk management and control systems which support us in the early recognition of developments that could jeopardize the continuity of our business. the most important of these systems include our enterprisewide processes for strategic planning and management reporting. strategic planning is intended to support us in considering potential risks and opportunities well in advance of major business decisions while management reporting is intended to enable us to monitor such risks more closely as our business progresses. our risk management and its contributing elements are regularly subject of audit activities by our internal audit function. accordingly if deficits are detected it is possible to adopt appropriate measures for their elimination. this coordination of processes and procedures is intended to help ensure that the managing board and the supervisory board are fully informed about significant risks in a timely manner.  risk management at siemens builds on a comprehensive interactive and managementoriented enterprise risk management erm approach that is integrated into the organization and that addresses both risks and opportunities. our erm approach is based on the globally accepted coso standard committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission enterprise risk management  integrating with strategy and performance  and the iso international organization for standardization standard   and is adapted to siemens requirements. the frameworks connect the erm process with our financial reporting process our internal control and our compliance management system. they consider a companys strategy the efficiency and effectiveness of its business operations the reliability of its financial reporting and compliance with relevant laws and regulations to be equally important.  our erm process aims for early identification and evaluation of and response regarding risks and opportunities that could materially affect the achievement of our strategic operational financial and compliance objectives. the time horizon is typically three years and we take a net risk approach addressing risks and opportunities remaining after the execution of existing and effective measures and controls. if risks have already been considered in plans budgets forecasts or the consolidated financial statements e.g. as a provision or risk contingency they are supposed to be incorporated with their financial impact in the entitys business objectives. as a consequence only additional risks arising from the same cause e.g. deviations from business objectives different impact perspectives should be considered. in order to provide a comprehensive view of our business activities risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way combining elements of both topdown and bottomup approaches. reporting generally follows a quarterly cycle we complement this periodic reporting with an adhoc reporting process that aims to escalate critical issues in a timely manner. relevant risks and opportunities are evaluated in terms of impact and likelihood considering different impact perspectives including business objectives reputation and regulatory requirements. the bottomup identification and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops with the respective managements of our organizational units. the topdown element ensures that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at different management levels and are included in the subsequent reporting process if found to be relevant. reported risks and opportunities are analyzed regarding potential cumulative effects and are aggregated within and for each of the organizational units mentioned above.  responsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportunities with the hierarchical level of responsibility depending on the significance of the respective risk or opportunity. in a first step assuming responsibility for a specific risk or opportunity involves choosing one of our general response strategies. our general response strategies with respect to risks are avoidance transfer reduction or acceptance of the relevant risk. our general response strategy with respect to opportunities is to pursue the relevant opportunity. in a second step responsibility for a risk or opportunity also involves the development initiation and monitoring of appropriate response measures corresponding to the chosen response strategy. these response measures have to be specifically tailored to allow for effective risk management. accordingly we have developed a variety of response measures with different characteristics. for example we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in currency and interest rates by engaging in hedging activities. regarding our projects systematic and comprehensive project management with standardized project milestones including provisional acceptances during project execution and complemented by clearly defined approval processes assists us in identifying and responding to project risks at an early stage even before the bidding phase. furthermore we maintain appropriate insurance levels for potential cases of damage and liability risks in order to reduce our exposure to such risks and to avoid or minimize potential losses. among others we address the risk of fluctuation in economic activity and customer demand by closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and developments in relevant industries and by adjusting capacity and implementing costreduction measures in a timely and consistent manner if they are deemed necessary. due to regular screening of climate risks and environmental social and governance esg developments we can initiate related mitigation actions in a timely manner  also as part of our degree implementation. worldwide there are risks from the transmission of infectious agents from animals to humans from humans to humans and in other ways. epidemic pandemic or other infectious developments such as bioterrorism to cause high disease rates in countries regions or continents. we constantly check information from the world health organization who the centers for disease control and prevention in the u.s. and europe the robert koch institute in germany and other institutions in order to be able to identify early epidemic or pandemic risks and determine and initiate related mitigation actions as early as possible.  .. risk management organization and responsibilities  to oversee the erm process and to further drive the integration and harmonization of existing control activities to align with legal and operational requirements the managing board established a risk management and internal control organization led by the head of assurance. in order to allow for a meaningful discussion at the siemens group level this organization aggregates individual risks and opportunities of similar causeandeffect nature into broader risk and opportunity themes. this aggregation naturally results in a mixture of risks including those with a primarily qualitative assessment and those with a primarily quantitative assessment the same applies to opportunities. accordingly we do not adopt a purely quantitative assessment of risk and opportunity themes. thematic risk and opportunity assessments as well as our riskbearing capacity then form the basis for the evaluation of the companywide risk and opportunity situation during the quarterly managing board meetings. the head of assurance assists the managing board with the operation and oversight of the risk and internal control system and reporting to the audit committee of the supervisory board.,0.1536462980741174,0.2595094233530347,,,0.2895139335284168,,,,,,0.3989698936216953,,0.3193011836003458,0.3283998196725036,,,0.1354150473215843,,
27,combined management report   increasing sustainability focus  governments around the world continue to increase their focus on sustainability topics resulting in the risk of increased costs to comply with new laws and related reporting requirements. in addition increasing stakeholder and investor focus on sustainability topics brings reputational risk should our sustainability commitments targets and activities be perceived as a deceptive use of green marketing or otherwise not credible. climate change litigation has become a worldwide phenomenon with a corresponding risk to siemens as a large corporation. we address these risks in a variety of ways including through our sustainability framework degree in which we have set ambitious sustainability targets. degree includes measures to reduce our carbon footprint along with other initiatives addressing esg topics more generally. we have implemented an esg due diligence process that supports siemens businesses with due diligence in the customeroriented environment with a view to possible environmental and social risks as well as related human rights and reputational risks. finally we believe our overall portfolio is very well positioned to meet the current and future sustainability needs of our customers and the societies in which we operate.  disruptive technologies  the markets in which our businesses operate experience rapid and significant changes due to the introduction of innovative and disruptive technologies. in the field of digitalization e.g. digital twin artificial intelligence cloud computing there are risks associated with new competitors substitutions for existing productssolutionsservices new business models e.g. in terms of pricing financing extended scopes for project business or subscription models in the software business and finally the risk that our competitors may have more advanced timetomarket strategies and introduce their disruptive products and solutions faster than siemens. siemens generally differentiates its software offerings from those of other software companies through deep domain knowhow. there are risks associated with technologies such as artificial intelligence including generative artificial intelligence that domain expertise will not be a significant distinguishing feature in the future and that additional competitors may therefore emerge more easily or rapidly. our operating results depend to a significant extent on our technological leadership our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in our markets and our ability to optimize our cost base accordingly. introducing new products and technologies requires a significant commitment to research and development which in return requires expenditure of considerable financial resources that may not always result in success. our results of operations may suffer if we invest in technologies that do not operate or may not be integrated as expected or that are not accepted in the marketplace as anticipated or if our products solutions or systems are not introduced to the market in a timely manner particularly compared to our competitors or even become obsolete. we constantly apply for new patents and actively manage our intellectual property portfolio to secure our technological position. however our patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling products and services that are similar to ours.  competitive environment  the worldwide markets for our products solutions and services are highly competitive in terms of pricing product and service quality product development and introduction time customer service financing terms and shifts in market demands. we face strong established competitors as well as rising competitors from emerging markets and new industries which may have a better cost structure or offer a better customer solution. some industries in which we operate are undergoing consolidation which may result in stronger competition a change in our relative market position an increase in inventory of finished or workinprogress goods or unexpected price erosion. furthermore there is a risk that critical suppliers could be taken over by competitors and a risk that competitors are increasingly offering services to our installed base. we address these risks with various measures for example benchmarking strategic initiatives sales push initiatives executing productivity measures and target cost projects rightsizing of our footprint outsourcings mergers and joint ventures and optimizing our product and service portfolio. we continuously monitor and analyze competitive market and industry information in order to be able to anticipate unfavorable changes in the competitive environment rather than merely reacting to such changes.  .. operational risks  cyberinformation security  digital technologies are deeply integrated into our business portfolio. further integration of information technology into products and services in conjunction with changing business strategies such as outsourcing globally distributed development a lesser degree of sole production are leading to an increasingly distributed supply chain making efficient controls difficult. the fact of a large number of suppliers requires a significant effort for the initial and regular verification of the effective implementation of cybersecurity requirements by suppliers. siemens business entities might lose market access if their products solutions and services do not comply with increased regulations and legal requirements for cybersecurity in their respective countries.  we observe a global increase of cybersecurity threats and higher levels of professionalism in computer crime which pose a risk to the security of siemens products solutions and services to siemens it systems and networks and to the confidentiality availability and integrity of data. like other large multinational companies we face active cyber threats from sophisticated adversaries that are supported by organized crime and nationstates engaged in economic espionage or even sabotage. according to external sources of relevant data this trend has been accelerated by geopolitical developments and tensions worldwide. especially the numbers of phishing attacks and malicious websites have increased significantly. there is a risk that confidential information or dataprivacyrelevant information may be stolen or that the integrity of our portfolio may be compromised such as by attacks on our networks social engineering data manipulations in critical applications or a loss of critical resources resulting in financial damages and violation of data privacy laws. moreover the information technology market is concentrated among a small number of information technology and software vendors which could lead to dependence on a single provider. there can be no assurance that the measures aimed at protecting our intellectual property and portfolio will address these threats under all circumstances. cybersecurity covers the it of our entire enterprise including office it systems and applications specialpurpose networks and our operating environments such as manufacturing and rd. we strive to mitigate these risks by employing a number of cyber defense measures including employee training considering new models of flexible working environments and comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems with an artificial intelligence solution to identify attacks faster and thereby prevent damage to society critical infrastructures our customers our partners and siemens overall. we initiated the industrial charter of trust signed by a growing group of global companies which sets out principles for building trust in digital technologies and creating a more secure digital world. nonetheless our systems products solutions and services as well as those of our service providers remain potentially vulnerable to attacks. such attacks could potentially lead to the publication manipulation or leakage of information such as through industrial espionage. they could also result in deliberate improper use of our systems vulnerable products production downtimes and supply shortages with potential adverse effects on our reputation our competitiveness and results of operations. for increased protection of siemens and reduction of a potential financial impact caused by cyber incidents the currently insurable cybersecurity risks have been to a partial extent transferred to a consortium of insurance companies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3585176380770349,,,,,,
28,combined management report   supply chain management  the financial performance of our operating units depends on reliable and effective supply chain management for components subassemblies energy critical parts e.g. semiconductors and materials. capacity constraints and supply shortages resulting from ineffective supply chain management may lead to production bottlenecks delivery delays quality issues and additional costs. we also rely on third parties to supply us with parts components and services. using third parties to manufacture assemble and test our products may reduce our control over manufacturing yields quality assurance product delivery schedules and costs. although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid supplyrelated problems there can be no assurance that we will not encounter supply problems in the future especially if we use singlesource suppliers for critical components. shortages and delays could materially harm our businesses. unanticipated increases in the price of components or raw materials due to market shortages or other reasons could also adversely affect performance. furthermore we may be exposed to the risk of delays and interruptions in the supply chain as a consequence of catastrophic events including pandemics geopolitical uncertainties energy shortages sabotage cyber incidents suppliers financial difficulties or suppliers not meeting our standards particularly if we are unable to identify alternative sources of supply or means of transportation in a timely manner or at all. besides other measures we mitigate price fluctuation in global raw material markets with various hedging instruments.  internal programs and initiatives  we are in a continuous process of operational optimization and constantly engage in costreduction initiatives including ongoing capacity adjustment measures and structural initiatives. consolidation of business activities and manufacturing facilities outsourcings joint ventures and the streamlining of product portfolios are all part of these costreduction efforts. these measures may not be implemented as planned may turn out to be less effective than anticipated may become effective later than estimated or may not become effective at all. any future contribution of these measures to our profitability will be influenced by the actual savings achieved and by our ability to sustain them. in case of restructuring and outsourcing activities there could be delays in product deliveries or we might even experience delivery failures. furthermore delays in critical rd projects could lead to negative impacts in running projects. we constantly control and monitor the progress of these projects and initiatives using standardized controlling and milestone tracking approaches.  shortage of skilled personnel  competition for diverse and highly qualified personnel such as specialists and experts in technical fields remains intense in the industries and regions in which our businesses operate. we have ongoing demand for highly skilled people and a need to enhance diversity inclusion and sense of belonging in our workforce. our future success depends in part on our continued ability to attract engineers tech talent and other qualified personnel. we address these topics for example by strengthening the capabilities and skills of our talent acquisition teams and a strategy of proactive search for people with the required capabilities in our respective industries and markets. in fiscal  we rolled out our new employer branding in all our recruiting marketing activities and started a media campaign with focus on tech talent in our key markets. technology and digitalization help us to be more effective in attracting and selecting diverse talent. in addition we have a focus on diversity and structured succession planning. as with our existing people we must also provide new talent with opportunities to grow and bond especially soon after they join us. this appears especially relevant at a time of new increasingly virtual working environments.  projectrelated risks  a number of our segments conduct activities under longterm contracts that are awarded on a competitive bidding basis. such contracts typically arise at mobility and in various activities of smart infrastructure or portfolio companies. some of these contracts are inherently risky because we may assume substantially all of the risks associated with completing a project and meeting postcompletion warranty obligations. for example we may face the risk that we must satisfy technical requirements of a project even though we have not gained experience with those requirements before winning the project. the profit margins realized on fixedpriced contracts may vary from original estimates as a result of changes in costs and productivity over a contracts term. we sometimes bear the risk of unanticipated project modifications shortage of key personnel quality problems financial difficulties of our customers andor significant partners cost overruns or contractual penalties caused by unexpected technological problems unexpected developments at the project sites unforeseen changes or difficulties in the regulatory or political environment performance problems with our suppliers subcontractors and consortium partners or other logistical difficulties. some of our multiyear contracts also contain demanding installation and maintenance requirements in addition to other performance criteria relating to timing unit cost and compliance with government regulations which if not satisfied could subject us to substantial contractual penalties damages nonpayment and contract termination. there can be no assurance that contracts and projects in particular those with longterm duration and fixedprice calculation can be completed profitably. to tackle those risks we established a global project management organization to systematically improve the technical and commercial capabilities of our project management personnel. for complex projects we conduct dedicated risk assessments in very early stages of the sales phase before we decide to hand over a binding offer to our customers.  .. financial risks  risks from pension obligations  the provisions for pensions and similar obligations may be affected by changes in actuarial assumptions including the discount rate as well as by movements in financial markets or a change in the mix of assets in our investment portfolio. additionally they are subject to legal risks with regard to plan design among other factors. a significant increase in underfunding may have a negative effect on our capital structure and rating and thus may tighten refinancing options and increase costs. in order to comply with local pension regulations in selected foreign countries we may face an economic risk of increasing cash outflows due to changes in funding level according to local regulations of our pension plans in these countries or to changes in the regulations themselves.  audits by tax authorities and changes in tax regulations  we operate in nearly all countries of the world and therefore are subject to many different tax regulations. changes in tax laws in any of these jurisdictions could result in higher tax expenses and increased tax payments. furthermore legislative changes could impact our tax receivables and liabilities as well as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. in addition the uncertain legal environment in some regions could limit our ability to enforce our rights. as a globally operating organization we conduct business in countries subject to complex tax rules which may be interpreted in different ways. future interpretations or developments of tax regimes may affect our business situation financial condition and results of operations. we are regularly audited by tax authorities in various jurisdictions and we continuously identify and assess relevant risks.  market price risks  we are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates especially between the u.s. dollar and the euro because a high percentage of our business volume is conducted as exports from europe to regions using the u.s. dollar. in addition we are exposed to effects involving the currencies of emerging markets in particular the chinese yuan. appreciable changes in euro exchange rates could materially change our competitive position. we are also exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. even hedging activities to mitigate such risks may result in a reverse effect. fluctuations in exchange or interest rates negative developments in the financial markets and changes,,0.2768937167571866,0.3854881120193881,0.3152463262061759,0.3137880852390665,0.3000900969306049,0.373432373353151,0.3241108143470363,0.2466721996797228,,,,0.3129730522304345,0.3347432275139369,,,,,0.2958168831710908
29,combined management report   in central bank policies could therefore negatively impact our financial results. market prices show higher volatility than in the past due to increased macroeconomic uncertainties resulting from inflation geopolitical tensions and other factors noted above.  liquidity and financing risks  our treasury and financing activities could face adverse deposit andor financing conditions from negative developments related to financial markets such as limited availability of funds and hedging instruments an updated evaluation of our solvency particularly from rating agencies negative interest rates and impacts arising from more restrictive regulation of the financial sector central bank policy or the usage of financial instruments. widening credit spreads due to uncertainty and risk aversion in the financial markets might lead to adverse changes in the market values of our financial assets in particular our derivative financial instruments.  credit risks  we provide our customers with various forms of direct and indirect financing of orders and projects including guarantees. siemens financial services in particular bears credit risks due to such financing activities if for example customers do not meet obligations arising from these financing arrangements meet them only partially or meet them late. the credit environment has become more dynamic due to a more uncertain macroeconomic outlook e.g. inflation and geopolitical tensions.  for further information on postemployment benefits derivative financial instruments hedging activities financial risk management and related measures see notes   and  in notes to consolidated financial statements for fiscal .  .. compliance risks  changes of regulations laws and policies regulatory requirements are being introduced or modified at an unprecedented rate often with little or no advance implementation lead time. this creates a risk that new requirements become effective more quickly than they can be implemented in the associated systems and processes potentially resulting in business disruptions and the need for manual mitigation interventions. as a diversified company with global businesses we are exposed to various product and countryrelated regulations laws and policies influencing our business activities and processes. according to observations and analysis there is an increasing risk that existing technical regulations in target markets will suddenly change or new ones will be set in force which result in market access criteria that our products do not meet. the affected products would lose marketability in this market. reducing the risk of a salesstop depends on the required correction for the nonconformity. in case the product can technically stay as is while it has to undergo new and additional conformity assessment and certification there will be considerable effort and cost to carry out the needed testing and certification procedures. in a worse case the affected product will need reengineering or redesign to meet the requirements of the changed or new technical regulation even before it can become reassessed and certified for market approval. the latter case will cause significant extra effort and cost to make the needed product changes and to maintain the countryspecific product variant as an additional derivative item in the portfolio. in the worst case if the two aforementioned ways of maintaining the products marketability prove to be not feasible we must stop selling the affected product in the market. the uncertain geopolitical situation has triggered unpredictable  and often conflicting  extraterritorial regulations restrictions and sanctions thus creating a potential risk that it will be difficult to simultaneously comply with all relevant regulatory requirements of certain transactions. complex crossjurisdictional regulations can vary between countries even within the same region each with slightly different rules and requirements creating a risk that a global standard cannot be effectively implemented and maintained potentially leading to a need for more custom or regional standards. we monitor the political and regulatory landscape in all our key markets to anticipate potential problem areas with the aim of quickly adjusting our business activities and processes to changed conditions. however any changes in regulations laws and policies could adversely affect our business activities and processes as well as our financial condition and results of operations.  current and future investigations regarding allegations of corruption of antitrust violations and of other violations of law  proceedings against us or our business partners regarding allegations of corruption of antitrust violations and of other violations of law may lead to fines as well as penalties sanctions injunctions against future conduct profit disgorgements disqualifications from directly and indirectly engaging in certain types of business the loss of business licenses or permits other restrictions and legal consequences as well as negative public media coverage. accordingly we may among other things be required to comply with potential obligations and liabilities arising in connection with such investigations and proceedings including potential tax penalties. moreover any findings related to public corruption that are not covered by the  and  corruption charge settlements which we concluded with u.s. and german authorities may endanger our business with government agencies and intergovernmental and supranational organizations. monitors could again be appointed to review future business practices and we may otherwise be required to further modify our business practices and our compliance program.  in its global business siemens does part of its business with stateowned enterprises and governments. we also participate in projects funded by government agencies and intergovernmental and supranational organizations such as multilateral development banks. ongoing or potential future investigations into allegations of corruption antitrust violations or other violations of law could as well impair relationships with such parties or could result in our exclusion from public contracts. such investigations may also adversely affect existing private business relationships and our ability to pursue potentially important strategic projects and transactions such as strategic alliances joint ventures or other business alliances or could result in the cancellation of certain of our existing contracts. moreover third parties including our competitors could initiate significant litigation.  in addition future developments in ongoing and potential future investigations such as responding to the requests of governmental authorities and cooperating with them could divert managements attention and resources from other issues facing our business. furthermore we might be exposed to compliance risks in connection with recently acquired operations that are in the ongoing process of integration.   along with other measures siemens has established a global compliance organization that conducts compliance risk mitigation processes such as compliance risk assessments among others or initiates audit activities performed by the internal assurance department.  sanctions and export control  as a globally operating organization we conduct business with customers in countries which are subject to export control regulations embargoes economic sanctions debarment policies or other forms of trade restrictions hereafter referred to as sanctions imposed by the u.s. the eu china or other countries or organizations. new or expanded sanctions in countries in which we do business may result in a curtailment of our existing business in such countries or indirectly in other countries. we are also aware of policies of national authorities and institutional investors such as pension funds or insurance companies requiring divestment of interests in and prohibiting investment in and transactions with entities doing business with countries identified by the u.s. department of state as,,,,,,,0.3565850154139838,0.2651737496051922,,0.2642188979185969,0.4533708750921067,0.1682574350540928,0.2880613051585969,0.3459036578770452,0.2721003922505359,,,0.1364006648449004,
30,combined management report   state sponsors of terrorism. as a result it is possible that such policies may result in our inability to gain or retain certain investors or customers. in addition the termination of our activities in sanctioned countries may expose us to customer claims and other actions. our reputation could also suffer due to our activities with counterparties in or affiliated with these countries or due to unauthorized diversion of our products to restricted parties or destinations. siemens addresses these risks by maintaining a comprehensive and robust control program.  protectionism including tariffstrade war  protectionist trade policies decoupling and changes in the political and regulatory environment in the markets in which we operate such as import and export controls tariffs and other trade barriers including debarment from certain markets inbound and outbound investment screenings and price or exchange controls could affect our business in national markets and could impact our business situation financial position and results of operations we may also be exposed to penalties other sanctions and reputational damage. in addition the uncertainty of the legal environment in some regions could limit our ability to enforce our rights and subject us to increasing costs related to adjusting our compliance programs.  environmental health  safety and other governmental regulations  some of the industries in which we operate are highly regulated. current and future environmental health safety and other governmental regulations or changes thereto may require us to change the way we run our operations and could result in significant increases in our operating or production costs. furthermore we see the risk of potential environmental health or safety incidents as well as potential noncompliance with environmental health or safety regulations affecting siemens and our contractors or subsuppliers resulting for example in serious injuries business interruptions penalties loss of reputation and internal or external investigations.  in addition while we have procedures in place to ensure compliance with applicable governmental regulations in the conduct of our business operations it cannot be excluded that violations of applicable governmental regulations may be caused either by us or by third parties that we contract with including suppliers or service providers whose activities may be attributed to us. any such violations particularly expose us to the risk of liability penalties fines reputational damage or loss of licenses or permits that are important to our business operations. in particular we could also face liability for damage or remediation for environmental contamination at the facilities we design or operate. with regard to certain environmental risks we maintain liability insurance at levels that our management believes are appropriate and consistent with industry practice. we may incur environmental losses beyond the limits or outside the coverage of such insurance and such losses may have an adverse effect on our business situation financial condition and results of operations.  current or future litigation and legal and regulatory proceedings  siemens is and potentially will be involved in numerous legal disputes and proceedings in various jurisdictions. these legal disputes and proceedings could result in particular in siemens being subject to payment of damages and punitive damages equitable remedies or sanctions fines or disgorgement of profit. in individual cases this may also lead to formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits. asserted claims are generally subject to interest rates. some of these legal disputes and proceedings could result in adverse decisions for siemens or decisions assessments or requirements of regulatory authorities could deviate from our expectations which may have material effects on our business activities as well as our financial position results of operations and cash flows. siemens maintains liability insurance for certain legal risks at levels our management believes are appropriate and consistent with industry practice. however the insurance policy does not protect siemens against in particular reputational damage. moreover siemens may incur losses relating to legal disputes and proceedings beyond the limits or outside the coverage of such insurance or exceeding any provisions made for losses related to legal disputes and proceedings. finally there can be no assurance that siemens will be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms in the future.  for additional information with respect to specific proceedings see note  in notes to consolidated financial statements for fiscal .  .. assessment of the overall risk situation  the most significant challenges have been mentioned first in each of the four risk categories strategic operational financial and compliance.  while our assessments of individual risks have changed during fiscal  due to developments in the external environment changes in our business portfolio effects of our own mitigation measures and the revision of our risk assessment the overall risk situation for siemens did not change significantly as compared to the prior year. we currently see the strategic risk economic political and geopolitical conditions as the most significant challenge for us followed by the operational risk cyberinformation security.  at present no risks have been identified that either individually or in combination could endanger our ability to continue as a going concern.. opportunities  within our erm we regularly identify evaluate and respond to opportunities that present themselves in our various fields of activity. below we describe our most significant opportunities. unless otherwise stated the opportunities described relate to all organizational units. the order in which the opportunities are presented reflects the currently estimated relative exposure for siemens associated with these opportunities and thus provides an indication of the opportunities current importance to us. the described opportunities are not necessarily the only ones we encounter. in addition our assessment of opportunities is subject to change because the company our markets and technologies are constantly advancing. it is also possible that opportunities we see today will never materialize.  favorable political and regulatory environment including sustainability  a favorable political and regulatory environment including the transition towards a lowcarbon economy could restore a more positive industrial investment sentiment that supports the growth of our markets. in addition government initiatives and subsidies including tax reforms green and digital recovery plans rd among others lead to more government spending e.g. infrastructure healthcare mobility or digitalization investments and may ultimately result in an opportunity for us to participate in ways that increase our revenue and profit. investments to strengthen countries resilience energy and food security as well as to diversify value chains close to major markets reshoring nearshoring can present opportunities to businesses. by enabling our customers to reduce their greenhouse gas ghg emissions using our portfolio and by reducing co emission in our own operations siemens strives to support the transition towards a lowcarbon economy.

initiatives.  value creation through innovation  we drive innovation by investing significantly in rd in order to develop sustainable solutions for our customers while also strengthening our own competitiveness. being an innovative company and constantly inventing new technologies that we expect will meet future demands arising from the megatrends of demographic change urbanization digitalization environmental change resource scarcity and glocalization is one of our core purposes. we are granted thousands of new patents every year and continuously develop new concepts and convincing new digital and datadriven business models. this helps us create the next generation of groundbreaking innovations in such fields as digital twin artificial intelligence automation and edge computing. across our operating units we are profiting from our strength in connecting the real and digital worlds. our xcelerator platform is an open digital business platform featuring a curated portfolio of iotenabled hardware and software an ecosystem and a marketplace to enhance the digital transformation of our customers. we see growth opportunities in opening up access to new markets and customers through new marketing and sales strategies which we implement in our operating units. our position along the value chains of automation and digitalization allows us to further increase market penetration. along these value chains we have identified several clear growth fields in which we see our greatest longterm potential. hence we are combining and developing our resources and capabilities for these growth fields.  leveraging market potential  through sales and services initiatives we continuously strive to grow and extend our businesses in established markets open up new markets for existing portfolio elements and strengthen our installed base in order to gain a higher market share and increased profits. furthermore we aim to increase our sales via improved account management and new distribution channels.  optimization of organization and processes  on the one hand we leverage ideas to drive further improvements in our processes and cost structure such as common computing architecture for image processing. furthermore we leverage ideas to drive further improvements in our processes and cost structure optimizing factory capacities for shorter lead times. on the other hand we see an opportunity of further penetrating markets by quality initiative program and avoiding or reducing non conformance cost.  mergers acquisitions equity investments partnerships divestments and streamlining our portfolio  we constantly monitor our current and potential markets to identify opportunities for strategic mergers acquisitions equity investments and partnerships which may complement our organic growth. such activities may help us to strengthen our position in our existing markets provide access to new or underserved markets or complement our technological portfolio in strategic areas. opportunities might also arise when portfolio optimization measures generate gains which enable us to further pursue our other strategies for growth and profitability.  assessment of the overall opportunities situation  the most significant opportunity for siemens is favorable political and regulatory environment including sustainability as described above.  while our assessments of individual opportunities have changed during fiscal  due to developments in the external environment changes in our business portfolio our endeavors to profit from them and revision of our strategic plans the overall opportunity situation for siemens did not change significantly as compared to the prior year.. significant characteristics of the internal control

based on the coso standard enterprise risk management  integrating with strategy and performance  and the iso international organization for standardization standard   and is adapted to siemens requirements. our ics is based on the internationally recognized internal control  integrated framework  also developed by coso. the framework defines the elements of a control system and sets the standard for assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of the ics. the frameworks connect the erm process with our financial reporting process and our ics both systems are complementary.  all siemens entities are part of our ics and erm. the scope of activities to be performed by each entity is different depending among others on the entitys impact on the consolidated financial statements of siemens and the specific risks associated with the entity. the management of each entity is obliged to implement an adequate and effective ics and erm within their area of responsibility based on the groupwide mandatory methodology.  overall responsibility for our ics and erm lies with the managing board. the siemens risk and internal control ric organization bundles and integrates the internal

an overall conclusion is made about the adequacy and effectiveness of our ics or erm. based on this the managing board has no indication that our ics or erm in their respective wholes have not been adequate or effective as of september  .  nevertheless there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of any risk management and control system. for example no system  even if deemed to be adequate and effective  can guarantee that all risks that will actually occur will be identified in advance or that any process violations will be ruled out under all circumstances.  the audit committee is systematically integrated into our ics and erm. in particular it oversees the accounting and the accounting process as well as the adequacy and effectiveness of the ics erm and the

each of which has been drawn in the full amount of us million.  the lines of credit and the relevant loan agreements mentioned above provide their respective lenders with a right of termination in the

grant each counterparty a right of termination including in certain cases of i a transformation for example mergers and changes of form ii an asset transfer or iii acquisition of ownership interests that enables the acquirer to exercise control over siemens ag or its controlling bodies. partially this right of termination exists only if  the resulting entity fails to simultaneously assume siemens ags obligations under the isda agreements or  the resulting entitys creditworthiness is materially weaker than siemens ags immediately prior to such event. generally isda agreements are designed such that upon termination all outstanding payment claims documented under them are to be netted.  . compensation agreements with members of the managing board or employees in the  event of a takeover bid  the contracts with the members of the managing board previously contained the right of the member to terminate his or her contract with the company for good cause in the event of a change of control that results in a substantial change in the position of a managing board member for example due to a change in corporate strategy or a change in the managing board members duties and responsibilities.

becomes a dependent enterprise as a result of entering into an intercompany agreement within the meaning of section  of the german stock corporation act or if siemens ag is to be merged into an existing corporation or other entity. if this right of termination is exercised the managing board member is entitled to a severance payment in the amount of no more than two years compensation. the calculation of the annual compensation includes not only the base compensation and the target amount for the bonus but also the target amount for the stock awards in each case based on the most recent completed fiscal year prior to termination of the contract. the stockbased compensation components for which a firm commitment already exists will remain unaffected. additionally the severance payments cover nonmonetary benefits by including an amount of  of the total severance amount. severance payments will be reduced by  as a lumpsum allowance for discounted values and for income earned elsewhere. however this reduction will apply only to the portion of the severance payment that was calculated without taking account of the first six months of the remaining term of the managing board members contract. there is no entitlement to a severance payment if the managing board member receives benefits from third parties in connection with a change of control. a right to terminate the contract does not exist if the change of control occurs within a period of twelve months prior to a managing board members retirement.  on september   the supervisory board of siemens ag resolved that the contracts with members of the managing board should not contain such right of termination in the future. this has already been taken into account in the case of contract extensions and in the case

52,consolidated financial statements   . notes to consolidated financial statements  note  basis of presentation  the accompanying consolidated financial statements present the operations of siemens aktiengesellschaft with registered offices in berlin registry number hrb  and munich registry number hrb  germany and its subsidiaries the company or siemens. they have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs as adopted by the european union as well as with the additional requirements set forth in section e  of the german commercial code hgb. the consolidated financial statements are in accordance with ifrs as issued by the international accounting standards board iasb. the consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the managing board on december  . siemens prepares and reports its consolidated financial statements in euros . due to rounding numbers presented may not add up precisely to totals provided. siemens is a german based multinational focused technology company.  note   material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates  certain of the following accounting policies require critical accounting estimates that involve complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions some of which may be for matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change. such critical accounting estimates could change from period to period and have a material impact on the companys results of operations financial positions and cash flows. critical accounting estimates could also involve estimates where siemens reasonably could have used a different estimate in the current accounting period. siemens cautions that future events often vary from forecasts and that estimates routinely require adjustment.  siemens operates in an increasingly complex and uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment particularly due to the war in ukraine and the conflict in israelgazamiddle east. notably we face continuing inflation increased interest rates volatile foreign currencies and share prices along with a rising apprehension of a slowdown of economic growth in significant markets compared to prior years. uncertainties increase in prognosis and forecasts in applying critical accounting estimates and in using management judgements. those trends could impact fair values and carrying amounts of assets and liabilities amount and timing of results of operations and cash flows of siemens. severity and duration of those trends are decisive on the magnitude of its impact on siemens consolidated financial statements. siemens based its estimates and assumptions on existing knowledge and best information available.  basis of consolidation   the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of siemens ag and its subsidiaries over which the company has control. siemens controls an investee if it has power over the investee. in addition siemens is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from the involvement with the investee and siemens is able to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of siemens return.  business combinations   cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination including contingent liabilities are initially measured at their fair values at the acquisition date irrespective of the extent of any noncontrolling interest. noncontrolling interests are measured at the proportional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed partial goodwill method. if there is no loss of control transactions with noncontrolling interests are accounted for as equity transactions not affecting net income. at the date control is lost any retained equity interests are remeasured to fair value. in case of a written put option on noncontrolling interests the company assesses whether the prerequisites for the transfer of present ownership interest are fulfilled at the balance sheet date. if the company is not the beneficial owner of the shares underlying the put option the exercise of the put option will be assumed at each balance sheet date and treated as equity transaction between shareholders with the recognition of a purchase liability at the respective exercise price. the noncontrolling interests participate in profits and losses during the reporting period.  associates and joint ventures   associates are companies over which siemens has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies generally through direct or indirect ownership of  to  of the voting rights. joint ventures are entities over which siemens and one or more parties have joint control. joint control requires unanimous consent of the parties sharing control in decision making on relevant activities.  associates and joint ventures are recorded in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method and are initially recognized at cost. if the investment was retained in a transaction in which siemens lost control of a subsidiary the fair value of the investment represents the cost on initial recognition. siemens share of its associates or joint ventures postacquisition profits or losses is recognized in the consolidated statements of income and its share of postacquisition changes in equity that have not been recognized in the associates or joint ventures profit or loss is recognized directly in equity. the cumulative postacquisition changes also include effects from fair value adjustments and are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. when siemens share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the investment siemens does not recognize further losses unless it incurs obligations or makes payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture. the interest in an associate or joint venture is the carrying amount of the investment together with any longterm interests that in substance form part of siemens net investment in the associate or joint venture.  siemens reviews associates and joint ventures for impairment whenever there is objective evidence that its investment is impaired for example a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost.  in addition siemens similarly assesses whether there are indications that an impairment loss recorded in prior periods may no longer exist or may have decreased. if this is the case any reversal of an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount subsequently increases not exceeding the carrying amount had no impairment loss been recognized in previous periods. impairments and reversal of impairments include the use of judgements.  foreign currency translation   assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is other than the euro are translated using the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period while the consolidated statements of income are translated using average exchange rates during the period. differences arising from such translations are recognized within equity and reclassified to net income when the gain or loss on disposal of the foreign subsidiary is recognized. the consolidated statements of cash flows are translated at average exchange rates during the period whereas cash and cash equivalents are translated at the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period.,,,0.2901495817348177,0.312223479472062,,,,,,,,,0.2923125157574495,,,,,,
53,consolidated financial statements   foreign currency transaction   transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of an entity are recorded at that functional currency applying the spot exchange rate at the date when the underlying transactions are initially recognized. at the end of the reporting period foreign currencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities are revalued to functional currency applying the spot exchange rate prevailing at that date. gains and losses arising from these foreign currency revaluations are recognized in net income. those foreign currencydenominated transactions which are classified as nonmonetary are remeasured using the historical spot exchange rate.  revenue recognition   siemens recognizes revenue when or as control over distinct goods or services is transferred to the customer i.e. when the customer is able to direct the use of the transferred goods or services and obtains substantially all of the remaining benefits provided a contract with enforceable rights and obligations exists and amongst others collectability of consideration is probable taking our customers creditworthiness into account. revenue is the transaction price siemens expects to be entitled to. variable consideration is included in the transaction price if it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur once associated uncertainties are resolved. the amount of variable consideration is calculated by either using the expected value or the most likely amount depending on which is expected to better predict the amount of variable consideration. consideration is adjusted for the time value of money if the period between the transfer of goods or services and the receipt of payment exceeds twelve months and there is a significant financing benefit either to the customer or siemens. if a contract contains more than one distinct good or service the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices. if standalone selling prices are not observable the company reasonably estimates those. revenue is recognized for each performance obligation either at a point in time or over time.  revenues from constructiontype contracts  revenues are recognized over time under the percentageofcompletion method based on the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs. an expected loss on the contract is recognized as an expense immediately. payment terms are usually  days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.  the percentageofcompletion method places considerable importance on accurate estimates of the extent of progress towards completion and may involve estimates on the scope of deliveries and services required to fulfill the contractually defined obligations. these significant estimates include total estimated costs total estimated revenues contract risks including technical political and regulatory risks risks from supply chain constraints and other judgments. under the percentageofcompletion method changes in estimates may lead to an increase or decrease of revenue. in addition siemens needs to assess whether the contract is expected to continue or whether it is terminated. in determining whether the continuation or termination of a contract is expected to be the most likely scenario all relevant facts and circumstances relating to the contract are considered on an individual basis.  revenues from maintenance and service contracts  revenues are recognized over time on a straightline basis or if the performance pattern is other than straightline as services are provided i.e. under the percentageofcompletion method as described above. payment terms are usually  days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.  revenues from product sales  revenues are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods passes to the buyer usually upon delivery of the goods. invoices are issued at that point in time and are usually payable within  days.  revenues from software contracts software contracts usually comprise the sale of subscription licenses and perpetual licenses which are both onpremise as well as technical support services including updates and unspecified upgrades and the sale of softwareasaservice. subscription contracts generally contain two separate performance obligations timebased software license and technical support service. revenues for perpetual and timebased licenses granting the customer a right to use siemens intellectual property are recognized at a point in time i.e. when control of the license passes to the customer. revenues for technical support services including updates and unspecified upgrades are recognized over time on a straightline basis as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by siemens services. softwareasaservice contracts including related cloud services represent one performance obligation for which revenues are recognized over time on a straightline basis. payment terms for all transactions are usually  days from the date of invoice issued according to the contractual terms.  income from interest   interest is recognized using the effective interest method.  functional costs   in general operating expenses by types are assigned to the functions following the functional area of the corresponding profit and cost centers. amortization depreciation and impairment of intangible assets and property plant and equipment are included in functional costs depending on the use of the assets.  productrelated expenses   provisions for estimated costs related to product warranties are recorded in line item cost of sales at the time the related sale is recognized.  research and development costs   costs of research activities are expensed as incurred. costs of development activities are capitalized when the recognition criteria in ias  are met. capitalized development costs are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses with an amortization period of generally three to  years.  earnings per share   basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations and net income all attributable to ordinary shareholders of siemens ag by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. diluted earnings per share are calculated by assuming conversion or exercise of all potentially dilutive securities and sharebased payment plans.  goodwill   goodwill is not amortized instead goodwill is tested for impairment annually as well as whenever there are events or changes in circumstances triggering events which suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. the goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of a cashgenerating unit or a group of cashgenerating units generally represented by a segment. siemens healthineers is tested one level below the segment. this is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.  for the purpose of impairment testing goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the group of cashgenerating units that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. if the carrying amount of the group of cashgenerating units to which the goodwill is allocated exceeds its recoverable amount an impairment loss on goodwill allocated to that group of cashgenerating units is recognized. the recoverable amount is the higher of the group of cashgenerating units fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. if either of these values exceeds the carrying amount it is not always necessary to determine both values.

54,consolidated financial statements   values are generally determined based on discounted cash flow calculations. impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed in future periods.  the determination of the recoverable amount of a group of cashgenerating units to which goodwill is allocated involves the use of estimates by management. the outcome predicted by these estimates is influenced e.g. by the successful integration of acquired entities volatility of capital markets interest rate developments foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the outlook on economic trends. in determining recoverable amounts discounted cash flow calculations generally use fiveyear projections in exceptional cases up to ten years that are based on financial forecasts. cash flow projections consider past experience and represent managements best estimate about future developments. cash flows after the planning period are extrapolated using individual growth rates. key assumptions on which management has based its determination of fair value less costs to sell and value in use include estimated growth rates and weighted average cost of capital. these estimates including the methodology used can have a material impact on the respective values and ultimately the amount of any goodwill impairment.  other intangible assets   the company amortizes intangible assets with finite useful lives on a straightline basis over their respective estimated useful lives. estimated useful lives for patents licenses and other similar rights generally range from three to five years except for intangible assets with finite useful lives acquired in business combinations. intangible assets acquired in business combinations primarily consist of customer relationships and trademarks as well as technology. useful lives in specific acquisitions ranged from two to  years for customer relationships and trademarks and for technology from five to  years.  property plant and equipment   property plant and equipment is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. depreciation expense is recognized using the straightline method. the following useful lives are assumed    factory and office buildings   to  years  other buildings    to  years  technical machinery  equipment   generally  years  office  other equipment   generally  years  equipment leased to others   generally  to  years    impairment of property plant and equipment and other intangible assets   the company reviews property plant and equipment and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. in addition intangible assets not yet available for use are subject to an annual impairment test. impairment testing of property plant and equipment and other intangible assets involves the use of estimates in determining the assets recoverable amount which can have a material impact on the respective values and ultimately the amount of any impairment.  leases   a contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. further information on leases can be found in notes   and .  lessor  leases are classified as either finance or operating leases determined based on whether substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset are transferred. if this is the case the lease is classified as a finance lease if not it is an operating lease. receivables from finance leases are recognized at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. the assets underlying the operating leases are presented in property plant and equipment and depreciated on a straightline basis over their useful lives or to their estimated residual value. operating lease income is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term.  lessee  siemens recognizes rightofuse assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of more than twelve months if the underlying asset is not of low value. payments for shortterm and lowvalue leases are expensed over the lease term. extension options are included in the lease term if their exercise is reasonably certain. rightofuse assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation expense and impairment losses adjusted for any remeasurements. rightofuse assets are depreciated under the straightline method over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the underlying assets. lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments due over the lease term generally discounted using the incremental borrowing rate. lease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. they are remeasured in case of modifications or reassessments of the lease.  discontinued operations and noncurrent assets held for disposal   discontinued operations are reported when a component of an entity is classified as held for disposal or has been disposed of if the component represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan to disposal. a noncurrent asset or a disposal group is held for disposal if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction or through a distribution to owners rather than through continuing use. depreciation and amortization cease for assets classified as held for disposal. in the consolidated statements of income and of cash flows discontinued operations are reported separately from continuing operations prior periods are presented on a comparable basis. the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements outside of note  relate to continuing operations or assets and liabilities not held for disposal. the noncurrent asset held for disposal or the disposal group is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. the determination of the fair value less costs to sell includes the use of estimates and assumptions that tend to be uncertain.  income taxes   tax positions are calculated taking into consideration the respective local tax laws relevant court decisions and applicable tax authorities views. tax regulations can be complex and possibly subject to different interpretations of tax payers and local tax authorities. different interpretations of existing or new tax laws as a result of tax reforms or other tax legislative procedures may result in additional tax payments for prior years and are taken into account based on managements considerations. under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected tax consequences of future periods attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. deferred tax assets are recognized if sufficient future taxable profit is available including income from forecasted operating earnings the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and available tax planning opportunities that siemens would execute. as of each periodend siemens evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on taxable income of past periods and projected future taxable profits. as future developments are uncertain and partly beyond siemenss control assumptions are necessary to estimate future taxable profits as well as the period in which deferred tax assets will recover. estimates are revised in the period in which there is sufficient evidence to revise the assumption.,0.2413790470882749,,0.2908514015867268,,0.3178639119138855,0.2866085352793505,0.3420666953404633,,,,0.3535273220254518,0.2473244824020768,,,,,,0.1654837206018901,0.2736243088641579
55,consolidated financial statements   expected tax effects arising from prospectively applying the global minimum taxation rules pillar two are not considered in calculating deferred tax assets and liabilities. currently it is expected to apply pillar two to the entire siemens group commencing with fiscal .  contract assets contract liabilities receivables   when either party to a contract with customers has performed siemens presents a contract asset a contract liability or a receivable depending on the relationship between siemens performance and the customers payment. contract assets and liabilities are presented as current since incurred in the normal operating cycle. receivables are recognized when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. valuation allowances for credit risks are made for contract assets and receivables in accordance with the accounting policy for financial assets measured at amortized cost.  inventories   inventories are valued at the lower of acquisition or production costs and net realizable value costs being generally determined based on an average or firstin firstout method. determining net realizable value of inventories involves accounting estimates for quantity technical and price risks.  defined benefit plans   siemens measures the entitlements by applying the projected unit credit method. the approach reflects an actuarially calculated net present value of the future benefit entitlement for services already rendered. in determining the net present value of the future benefit entitlement for service already rendered defined benefit obligation dbo the expected rates of salary and pension increases are considered. the assumptions used for the calculation of the dbo as of the periodend of the preceding fiscal year are used to determine the calculation of service cost and interest income and expense of the following year. significant plans apply individual spot rates from full discount rate curves to determine service cost and interest expense. the net interest income or expense for the fiscal year will be based on the discount rate for the respective year multiplied by the net defined benefit liability asset at the preceding fiscal years periodend date.  service cost past service cost and settlement gains losses for pensions and similar obligations as well as administration costs unrelated to the management of plan assets are allocated among functional costs. past service cost and settlement gains losses are recognized immediately in profit or loss. for unfunded plans the amount in line item provisions for pensions and similar obligations equals the dbo. for funded plans siemens offsets the fair value of the plan assets from the dbo. siemens recognizes the net amount after adjustments for effects relating to any asset ceiling.  remeasurements comprise actuarial gains and losses as well as the difference between the return on plan assets and the amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability asset. they are recognized in other comprehensive income net of income taxes.  actuarial valuations rely on key assumptions including discount rates expected compensation increases rate of pension progression and mortality rates. discount rates used are determined by reference to yields on highquality corporate bonds of appropriate duration and currency at the end of the reporting period. in case such yields are not available discount rates are based on government bonds yields. due to changing market economic and social conditions the underlying key assumptions may differ from actual developments.  entitlements resulting from plans based on asset returns from underlying assets are generally measured at the fair value of the underlying assets at periodend. if the performance of the underlying assets is lower than a guaranteed return the dbo is measured by projecting forward the contributions at the guaranteed fixed return and discounting back to a present value.  provisions   a provision is recognized in the statement of financial position when  it is probable that the company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and  it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and  a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. if the effect is material provisions are recognized at present value by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. when a contract becomes onerous the present obligation under the contract is recognized as a provision.  significant estimates are involved in the determination of provisions related to onerous contracts warranty costs asset retirement obligations legal and regulatory proceedings as well as governmental investigations legal proceedings. siemens records a provision for onerous contracts with customers when current estimates of total estimated costs exceed estimated revenue. onerous contracts with customers are identified by monitoring the progress of the project and updating the estimates which requires significant judgment relating to achieving certain performance standards as well as estimates involving warranty costs and estimates regarding project delays including the assessment of responsibility splits between the contract partners for these delays.  legal proceedings often involve complex legal issues and are subject to substantial uncertainties. accordingly considerable judgment is part of determining whether it is probable that there is a present obligation as a result of a past event at the end of the reporting period whether it is probable that such a legal proceeding will result in an outflow of resources and whether the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. internal and external counsels are generally part of the determination process. due to new developments it may be necessary to record a provision for an ongoing legal proceeding or to adjust the amount of a previously recognized provision. upon resolution of a legal proceeding siemens may incur charges in excess of the recorded provisions for such matters. the outcome of legal proceedings may have a material effect on siemens financial position its results of operations andor its cash flows.  termination benefits   termination benefits are provided as a result of an entitys offer made in order to encourage voluntary redundancy before the regular retirement date or from an entitys decision to terminate the employment. termination benefits in accordance with ias  employee benefits are recognized as a liability and an expense when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits.  financial instruments   a financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. based on their contractual cash flow characteristics and the business model they are held in financial instruments are classified as financial assets and financial liabilities measured at cost or amortized cost measured at fair value loan commitments contract assets and receivables from finance leases. regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are accounted for at the trade date. initially financial instruments are recognized at fair value and net of transaction costs if not categorized at fvtpl. subsequently financial assets and liabilities are measured according to the category to which they are assigned to  financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss fvtpl  a mandatorily measured at fvtpl debt financial assets are measured at fvtpl if the business model they are held in is not a holdtocollect or a holdandsell business model or if their contractual cash flows do not represent solely payments of principal and interest. equity instruments are measured at fvtpl unless the fvocioption is elected. b financial assets designated as measured at fvtpl are irrevocably designated at initial recognition if the designation significantly reduces accounting mismatches that would otherwise arise if assets and liabilities as well as recognizing gains losses were measured on different bases.,0.1668666194033989,0.267428714946209,0.3352311465022219,0.3504047006172247,0.32955792800571,0.3726377215665707,0.4120977887229251,0.3411872106256541,0.2866558034642967,0.3090811966079029,0.4374967894963923,0.2161926307511124,0.2968950502479737,0.3327903096772832,0.2710411736341055,0.2790478674169002,0.153190374330172,0.1160143397798189,0.3080645959646177
56,consolidated financial statements   financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income fvoci  are equity instruments for which siemens irrevocably elects to present subsequent fair value changes in oci at initial recognition of the instrument. unrealized gains and losses net of deferred income tax expenses as well as gains and losses on the subsequent sale of the instruments are recognized in line item other comprehensive income net of income taxes.  financial assets measured at amortized cost  loans receivables and other debt instruments held in a holdtocollect business model with contractual cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less valuation allowances for expected credit losses.  valuation allowances are set up for expected credit losses representing a forwardlooking estimate of future credit losses involving significant judgment. expected credit loss is the gross carrying amount less collateral multiplied by the probability of default and a factor reflecting the loss in the event of default. valuation allowances are not recognized as far as the gross carrying amount is sufficiently collateralized. probabilities of default are mainly derived from internal rating grades. a simplified approach is used to assess expected credit losses from trade receivables lease receivables and contract assets by applying their lifetime expected credit losses. the valuation allowance for loans and other longterm debt instruments primarily held at financial services sfs is measured according to a threestage impairment approach  stage   at inception twelvemonth expected credit losses are recognized based on a twelve months probability of default.  stage   if the credit risk of a financial asset increases significantly without being creditimpaired lifetime expected credit losses are recognized based on a lifetime probability of default. a significant increase in credit risk is determined for each individual financial instrument using internal credit ratings. a rating deterioration does not trigger a transfer into stage  if the credit rating remains within the investment grade range. more than  days past due payments will not be transferred into stage  if the delay is not creditriskrelated.  stage   if the financial asset is creditimpaired valuation allowances equal lifetime expected credit losses. a financial asset is considered creditimpaired when there is observable information about significant financial difficulties and a high vulnerability to default however the definition of default is not yet met. impairment triggers include liquidity problems a request for debt restructuring or a breach of contract. a creditrisk driven contractual modification always results in a creditimpaired financial asset.  financial assets are written off as uncollectible if recovery appears unlikely. generally if the limitation period expired when a debtors sworn statement of affairs is received or when the receivable is not pursued due to its minor value. receivables are written off when bankruptcy proceedings close.  a financial asset is derecognized when the rights to cash flows expire or the financial asset is transferred to another party. significant modifications of contractual terms of a financial asset measured at amortized cost result in derecognition and recognition of a new financial asset for insignificant modifications the carrying amount of the financial asset is adjusted without derecognition.  cash and cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid investments with less than three months maturity from the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. cash and cash equivalents are measured at cost.  loan commitments   expected credit losses for irrevocable loan commitments are determined using the threestage impairment approach for financial assets measured at amortized cost and recognized as a liability.  financial liabilities   except for derivative financial instruments siemens measures financial liabilities at amortized cost using the effective interest method.  derivative financial instruments   derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts are measured at fair value unless they are designated as hedging instruments for which hedge accounting is applied. changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized either in net income or in the case of a cash flow hedge in line item other comprehensive income net of income taxes applicable deferred income tax. certain derivative instruments embedded in host contracts are also accounted for separately as derivatives.  fair value hedges  the carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted by the gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk. where an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as hedged item the subsequent cumulative change in its fair value is recognized as a separate financial asset or liability with corresponding gain or loss recognized in net income. for hedged items carried at amortized cost the adjustment is amortized until maturity of the hedged item. for hedged firm commitments the initial carrying amount of the assets or liabilities that result from meeting the firm commitments are adjusted to include the cumulative changes in the fair value that were previously recognized as separate financial assets or liabilities.  cash flow hedges  the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recognized in line item other comprehensive income net of income taxes and any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in net income. amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified into net income in the same periods in which the hedged item affects net income.  sharebased payment   sharebased payment awards at siemens are predominately designed as equitysettled. fair value is measured at grant date and is expensed over the vesting period. fair value is determined as the price of the underlying shares considering dividends during the vesting period the grantees are not entitled to as well as market conditions and nonvesting conditions if applicable. plans granting the rights to receive subsidiary shares constitute own shares and accordingly are accounted as equitysettled.  insurance contracts   in june  the iasb issued ifrs  insurance contracts ifrs  effective for

postemployment benefits  defined benefit plans  the defined benefit plans open to new entrants are based predominantly on contributions made by the company. only to a certain extent those plans are affected by longevity inflation and compensation increases and take country specific differences into account. the companys major plans are funded with assets in segregated entities. in accordance with local laws these plans are managed in the interest of the beneficiaries by way of contractual trust agreements with each separate legal entity. the defined benefit plans cover  participants including  actives  deferreds with vested benefits and  retirees and surviving dependents.  germany  in germany pension benefits are provided through the following plans bsav beitragsorientierte siemens altersversorgung frozen legacy plans as well as deferred compensation plans. the majority of active employees participate in the bsav. those benefits are based predominantly on notional contributions and the return on the corresponding assets of this plan subject to a minimum return guaranteed by the employer. at inception of the bsav benefits provided under the frozen legacy plans were modified to substantially eliminate the effects of compensation increases. however the frozen plans still expose siemens to investment risk interest rate risk inflation risk and longevity risk. the pension plans are funded via contractual trust arrangements cta. in germany no legal or regulatory minimum funding requirements apply.  u.s. in the u.s. the pension plans are sponsored by siemens which for the most part have been frozen to new entrants and to future benefit accruals except for interest credits on cash balance accounts. siemens has appointed the investment committee as the named fiduciary for the management of the assets of the plans. the plans assets are held in trusts and the trustees of the trusts are responsible for the administration of the assets of the trusts taking directions from the investment committee. the plans are subject to the funding requirements under the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa. there is a regulatory

commitments denominated in foreign currencies. particularly the company entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the risk of variability of future cash flows resulting from forecast sales and purchases as well as firm commitments. the risk mainly results from contracts denominated in us both from siemens operating units entering into longterm contracts e.g. from the project

fluctuations may result in significant earnings and cash flow volatility risk for siemens. the companys operating business as well as its investment and financing activities are affected particularly by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. in order to optimize the allocation of financial resources across siemens segments and entities as well as to achieve its aims siemens identifies analyzes and manages the associated market risks. the company seeks to manage and control these risks primarily through its regular operating and financing activities and uses derivative financial instruments when deemed appropriate.  foreign currency exchange rate risk is quantified based on a sensitivity analysis. in order to quantify remaining market risks siemens has implemented a system based on value at risk var which is also used for internal management of corporate treasury activities. the var figures are calculated based on historical volatilities and correlations of various risk factors a ten day holding period and a . confidence level.  actual results that are included in the consolidated statements of income or consolidated statements of comprehensive income may differ substantially from var figures due to fundamental conceptual differences. while the consolidated statements of income and consolidated statements of comprehensive income are prepared in accordance with ifrs the var figures are the output of a model with a purely financial perspective and represent the potential financial loss which will not be exceeded within ten days with a probability of .. although var is an important tool for measuring market risk the assumptions on which the model is based give rise to some limitations including the following. a ten day holding

finally determining the possible range of the future outcomes on the basis of this statistic behavior may not always cover all possible scenarios especially those of an exceptional nature.  any market sensitive instruments including equity and interestbearing investments that our companys pension plans hold are not included in the following quantitative and qualitative disclosures.  foreign currency exchange rate risk  transaction risk  each siemens unit conducting businesses with international counterparties leading to future cash flows denominated in a currency other than its functional currency is exposed to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. in the ordinary course of business siemens units are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations particularly between the u.s. dollar and the euro. foreign currency exchange rate exposure is partly balanced by purchasing of goods commodities and services in the respective currencies as well as production activities and other contributions along the value chain in the local markets.  operating units are prohibited from borrowing or investing in foreign currencies on a speculative basis. intercompany financing or investments of operating units are preferably carried out in their functional currency or on a hedged basis.  according to the company policy siemens units are responsible for recording assessing and monitoring their foreign currency transaction exposure. foreign currency transaction exposure of siemens units from contracted business and cash balances in foreign currency is generally hedged approximately by  with corporate treasury. foreign currency transaction exposure of siemens units from planned business above defined thresholds has to be hedged with corporate treasury within a band of  to  for a hedging period of at least three months.  generally the operating units conclude their hedging activities internally with corporate treasury. by applying a costoptimizing portfolio approach corporate treasury itself hedges foreign currency exchange rate risks with external counterparties and limits them.  the following table demonstrates the sensitivity of net income and equity to a reasonably possible change in the euro versus the most important currency exchange rates compared to the respective yearend exchange rates. the analysis does not include effects of foreign currency translation. the effect on net income is due to changes in the fair values of monetary assets and liabilities including nondesignated foreign currency derivatives and embedded derivatives. the effect on equity is due to changes in the fair values of forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges. in fiscal  the sensitivity of net income with regard to the u.s. dollar decreased compared to the prior year mainly due to a decrease of monetary assets and liabilities and a higher hedge ratio. the sensitivity of equity with regard to the u.s. dollar decreased due to a decline in the nominal amount of u.s. dollar forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges.  translation risk  many siemens units are located outside the eurozone. because the financial reporting currency of siemens is the euro the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into euro for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. to consider the effects of foreign currency translation in the risk management the general assumption is that investments in foreignbased operations are permanent and that reinvestment is continuous. effects from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of net asset amounts into euro are reflected in the companys consolidated equity position.  interest rate risk  interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. this risk arises whenever interest terms of financial assets and liabilities are different. in order to manage the companys position with regard to interest rate risk interest income and interest expenses corporate treasury performs a comprehensive corporate interest rate risk management by using fixed or variable interest rates from bond issuances and derivative financial instruments when appropriate. the interest rate risk is mitigated by managing interest rate risk within an integrated asset liability management approach and results primarily from funding in the u.s. dollar british pound and euro. this includes sfs business for which the interest rate risk was formerly managed separately.  if there are no conflicting countryspecific regulations all siemens operating units generally obtain any required financing through corporate treasury in the form of loans or intercompany clearing accounts. the same concept is adopted for deposits of cash generated by the units.  as of september   and  the var relating to the interest rate was  million and  million. the decrease was driven mainly by a decrease in interest rate sensitivity for the u.s. dollar and a lower interest rate volatility for the euro.

79,consolidated financial statements   liquidity risk  liquidity risk results from the companys inability to meet its financial liabilities. siemens follows a deliberated financing policy that is aimed towards a balanced financing portfolio a diversified maturity profile and a comfortable liquidity cushion. siemens mitigates liquidity risk by the implementation of effective working capital and cash management arranged credit facilities with highly rated financial institutions via a debt issuance program and via a global multicurrency commercial paper program. liquidity risk may also be mitigated by the siemens bank gmbh which increases the flexibility of depositing cash or refinancing.  in addition siemens constantly monitors funding options available in the capital markets as well as trends in the availability and costs of such funding with a view to maintaining financial flexibility and limiting repayment risks.  the following table reflects our contractually fixed payoffs for settlement repayments and interest. the disclosed expected undiscounted net cash outflows from derivative financial liabilities are determined based on each particular settlement date of an instrument and based on the earliest date on which siemens could be required to pay. cash outflows for financial liabilities including interest without fixed amount or timing are based on the conditions existing at september  .                         fiscal year  in millions of        to    and thereafter  nonderivative financial liabilities      notes and bonds              loans from banks             other financial indebtedness          lease liabilities              trade payables          other financial liabilities             derivative financial liabilities              credit guarantees       irrevocable loan commitments                      based on the maximum amounts siemens could be required to settle in the event of default by the primary debtor.   a considerable portion result from assetbased lending transactions meaning that the respective loans can only be drawn after sufficient collateral has been provided by the borrower.           credit risk  credit risk is defined as an unexpected loss in financial instruments if the contractual partner is failing to discharge its obligations in full and on time or if the value of collateral declines.  siemens provides its customers with various forms of direct and indirect financing particularly in connection with large projects. hence credit risks are determined by the solvency of the debtors the recoverability of the collaterals the success of projects we invested in and the global economic development.  the effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk through credit evaluations and ratings is a core competency of our risk management system. in this context siemens has implemented a binding credit policy.  siemens maintains a credit risk intelligence unit to which numerous operating units from the siemens group regularly transfer business partner data as a basis for a centralized internal rating and credit limit recommendation process. due to the identification quantification and active management of credit risks this increases credit risk transparency.  ratings and individually defined credit limits are based on generally accepted rating methodologies with information obtained from customers external rating agencies data service providers and siemens credit default experiences. internal ratings consider appropriate forwardlooking information relevant to the specific financial instrument like expected changes in the debtors financial position ownership management or operational risks as well as broader forwardlooking information such as expected macroeconomic industryrelated and competitive developments. the ratings also consider a countryspecific risk component derived from external country credit ratings. ratings and credit limits for financial institutions as well as siemens public and private customers which are determined by internal risk assessment specialists are continuously updated and considered for investments in cash and cash equivalents and in determining the conditions under which direct or indirect financing will be offered to customers.  an exposure is considered defaulted if the debtor is unwilling or unable to pay its credit obligations. a range of internally defined events trigger a default rating including the opening of bankruptcy proceedings receivables being more than  days past due or a default rating by an external rating agency.  to analyze and monitor credit risks the company applies various systems and processes. a main element is a central it application that processes data from operating units together with rating and default information and calculates an estimate which may be used as a basis for individual bad debt provisions. additionally qualitative information is considered to particularly incorporate the latest developments.  the carrying amount is the maximum exposure to a financial assets credit risk without taking account of any collateral. collateral reduces the

declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.  basis for the opinions  we conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with sec.  hgb and the eu audit regulation no  referred to subsequently as eu audit regulation and in compliance with german generally accepted standards for financial statement audits promulgated by the institut der wirtschaftsprüfer institute of public auditors in germany idw. we performed the audit of the consolidated financial statements in supplementary compliance with the international standards on auditing isas. our responsibilities under those requirements principles and standards are further described in the auditors responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report section of our auditors report. we are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of european law and german commercial and professional law and we have fulfilled our other german professional responsibilities in

consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year from october   to september  . these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.  below we describe what we consider to be the key audit matters  revenue recognition on constructiontype contracts  reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter  the group conducts a significant portion of its business under constructiontype contracts particularly in the mobility business. revenue from longterm constructiontype contracts is recognized in accordance with ifrs  revenue from contracts with customers generally over time under the percentageofcompletion method. we consider the accounting for constructiontype contracts to be an area posing a significant risk of material misstatement including the potential risk of management override of internal controls and accordingly a key audit matter because managements assessments significantly impact the determination of the extent of progress towards completion. these assessments include in particular the scope of deliveries and services required to fulfill contractually defined obligations total estimated contract costs remaining costs to completion and total estimated contract revenues as well as contract risks including technical political regulatory legal and supply chain risks.,,,0.3173219994904541,0.3115813159704438,,,0.3155095544794634,,,,,,,,,,,,
108,independent auditors reports group    revenues total estimated contract costs and profit recognition may deviate significantly from original estimates based on new knowledge about cost overruns and changes in project scope over the term of a constructiontype contract.  the effects of current geopolitical and macroeconomic developments on the project business such as delays in project execution price increases or disruptions in supply chains and their accounting treatment were taken into account during our audit.  auditors response  as part of our audit we obtained an understanding of the groups internally established methods processes and control mechanisms for project management in the bid and execution phase of constructiontype contracts. in this regard we assessed the design and operating effectiveness of the accountingrelated internal controls in the project business by obtaining an understanding of business transactions specific to constructiontype contracts from the initiation of the transaction through presentation in the consolidated financial statements. we also tested controls addressing the timely assessment of changes in cost estimates the timely and complete recognition of such changes in the project calculation as well as their accounting treatment.  as part of our substantive audit procedures which particularly involved project reviews we evaluated managements estimates and assumptions based on a riskbased selection of a sample of contracts. our sample primarily included projects that are subject to significant future uncertainties and risks such as projects with complex safetytechnical and regulatory requirements or projects with a large portion of materials and services to be provided by suppliers or consortium partners fixedprice or turnkey projects crossborder projects and projects with changes in cost estimates delays andor low or negative margins.  our audit procedures included among others review of the contracts and their terms and conditions including contractually agreed partial deliveries and services termination rights penalties for delay and breach of contract liquidated damages as well as joint and several liability. in order to evaluate whether revenues were recognized on an accrual basis for the selected projects we analyzed revenues attributable to the fiscal year and corresponding cost of sales to be recognized in the statement of income considering the extent of progress towards completion and examined the accounting for the associated items in the statement of financial position.  for this we also assessed the accounting for contractually agreed options contract amendments or contract terminations including related pending legal proceedings also in relation to previous constructiontype contracts with russian customers. we also assessed the recognition requirements of reimbursement claims.  we further performed inquiries of project management both commercial and technical project managers with respect to the development of the projects the reasons for deviations between planned and actual costs the current estimated costs to complete the projects and managements assessments on probabilities that contract risks and claims from joint and several liability will materialize.  to identify anomalies in the development of margins and other project kpis we also applied data analysis procedures. in designing our audit procedures we also considered results from project audits conducted by the internal audit function. furthermore we obtained evidence from third parties for selected projects e.g. project acceptance documentation contractual terms and conditions and lawyers confirmations regarding alleged breaches of contract and asserted claims and inspected the status of projects at plant sites. due to the large contract volume and risk profile our audit procedures focused on large contracts for delivery of highspeed and commuter trains.  our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to revenue recognition on constructiontype contracts.  reference to related disclosures  with regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for constructiontype contracts refer to note  material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. with respect to contract assets and liabilities as well as provisions for order related losses and risks refer to note  contract assets and liabilities note  provisions and note  commitments and contingencies in the notes to

september  siemens ag has held a . stake in the listed siemens energy ag which was reduced to . due to capital measures at siemens energy ag and the contribution of shares in siemens energy ag to the siemens pensiontrust e.v. in fiscal year . the investment is accounted for as an associate applying the equity method in accordance with ias  investments in associates and joint ventures. as of june   an impairment was recognized on the investment. during the first six months of the financial year  the market capitalization of the investment was mostly higher than the value at the time of the impairment. as of march   the latter was significantly exceeded. as a result an impairment reversal was made in accordance with ias  impairment of assets in the amount of the increase in the stock market price since the date of the impairment until march  . in addition siemens energy ag acquired additional shares in siemens gamesa renewable energy s.a. in fiscal year . this led to a reduction in equity in the consolidated financial statements of siemens energy ag. the recognition of siemens share in this equity transaction resulted in a reduction of the carrying amount of the investment in siemens energy ag which was recognized directly in siemens equity. as of september   the pro rata market value of the investment was above the book value.  due to the judgments and estimates by management in the analyses and assessments with regards to possible impairments or reversals of impairments as well as the overall material implications for the assets liabilities and financial position of the group and the related significant risk of material misstatement the assessment of the investment in siemens energy ag is one of the key audit matters.  auditors response  as part of our audit procedures in relation to managements assessment regarding the valuation of the investment in siemens energy ag we examined the methods and processes defined internally for the identification of indicators for a reversal of an impairment and thus the timing of a possible reversal of an impairment as well as the measurement of a reversal of an impairment of the investment in siemens energy ag.  with regards to the assessment of whether there are indications for a reversal of an impairment in particular regarding the interpretation of a possible significant increase of the fair value we evaluated managements assessment made on a quarterly and yearend basis as well as managements judgements and estimates contained therein and also considered external evidence on credit ratings stock market prices analysts assessments and observable valuation indicatorsin this regard. in addition we evaluated the calculation of the reversal of the impairment as of march  .,0.1516485594985135,,,,,0.5023895862994779,,,,,,0.2246118104404432,,,,,,0.1073545310825244,
109,independent auditors reports group    in order to assess the valuation of the investment in fiscal year  we also considered the effects for siemens ag from the acquisition of the shares in siemens gamesa renewable energy s.a. by siemens energy ag the capital increase of siemens energy ag and the contribution of shares in siemens energy ag to the siemens pensiontrust e.v. by siemens ag.  furthermore we evaluated the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements regarding the investment in siemens energy ag and the reversal of the impairment the effects of the other transactions described above as well as the events affecting siemens energy ag after the balance sheet date.  our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations regarding the valuation of the investment in siemens energy ag as of september  .  reference to related disclosures  with regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for investments in associates refer to note  material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. details on the reversal of the impairment of the investment in siemens energy ag and the other described transactions are presented in note  interests in other entities. regarding the subsequent events relating to the investment in siemens energy ag refer to note  subsequent events.  provisions for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations  reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter  we consider the accounting for provisions for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations including allegations of corruption and antitrust violations to be a key audit matter. these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and require estimates that could have a significant impact on the recognition and measurement of the respective provision and accordingly on assets liabilities and financial performance. the proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations are subject to uncertainties because they involve complex legal issues and accordingly considerable management judgment in particular when determining whether and in what amount a provision is required to account for the risks.  auditors response  during our audit of the financial reporting of proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations we examined the processes implemented by siemens for identifying assessing and accounting for legal and regulatory proceedings. to determine what potentially significant pending legal proceedings or claims asserted are known and to assess managements estimates of the expected cash outflows our audit procedures included inquiring of management and other persons within the group entrusted with these matters obtaining written statements from inhouse legal counsels with respect to the assessment of estimated cash outflows and their probability obtaining confirmations from external legal advisors and evaluating internal statements concerning the accounting treatment in the consolidated financial statements. furthermore we examined legal consulting expense accounts for any indications of legal matters not yet considered.  we further considered alleged or substantiated noncompliance with legal provisions official regulations including sanctions and internal company policies by inspecting internal and external statements on specific matters obtaining written statements from external legal advisors and by inquiring of the compliance organization. in this regard among other procedures we evaluated the conduct and results of internal investigations by inspecting internal reports and the measures taken to remediate identified weaknesses and assessed on this basis whether managements evaluation of any risks to be accounted for in the consolidated financial statements is plausible.  furthermore we evaluated the disclosures on proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations.  reference to related disclosures  with regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied in accounting for provisions refer to note  material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. with respect to proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations refer to note  legal proceedings.  uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes  reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter  siemens operates in numerous countries with different local tax legislation. the accounting for uncertain tax positions as well as deferred taxes requires management to exercise considerable judgment and make estimates and assumptions and was therefore a key audit matter. in particular this affects the measurement and completeness of uncertain tax positions the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the measurement and completeness of deferred tax liabilities.  auditors response with the assistance of internal tax specialists who have knowledge of relevant local tax law we examined the processes installed by management for the identification recognition and measurement of tax positions.  in the course of our audit procedures relating to uncertain tax positions we evaluated whether managements assessment of the tax implications of significant business transactions or events in fiscal year  which could result in uncertain tax positions or influence the measurement of existing uncertain tax positions was in compliance with tax law. in particular this includes the tax implications arising from cross border matters such as the determination of transfer prices the results of tax field audits the acquisition or disposal of company shares and corporate intragroup restructuring activities. in order to assess measurement and completeness we also obtained confirmations from external tax advisors. further we evaluated managements assessments with respect to the prospects of success of appeal and tax court proceedings by inquiring of the employees of the siemens tax department and by considering current tax case law.  in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets we above all analyzed managements assumptions with respect to tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income and compared them to internal business plans. in the course of our audit procedures regarding deferred tax liabilities we examined in particular the assumptions regarding reinvestment of subsidiaries retained profits for an indefinite period and assessed these taking into account dividend planning.  our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the accounting for uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes.,0.2132921782393829,,,0.317563716629648,,,0.3134325036846073,,,,,,,,0.2972189575383415,,,,

expense. items are depreciated on a pro rata temporis basis in the year of acquisition. lowvalue noncurrent assets that are subject to wear and tear movable and capable of being used independently are expensed immediately or capitalized and fully depreciated in the year of acquisition.  useful lives of property plant and equipment         factory and office buildings   to  years  other buildings

objective evidence particularly events or changes in circumstances indicate a significant or other than temporary decline in value. in case of an impairment in prior periods a lower recognized value may not be maintained if the reasons for the impairment do no longer exist.  inventories  are measured at the lower of average acquisition or production costs and daily values. production costs comprise in addition to direct costs an appropriate portion of production and material overheads and depreciation of property plant and equipment. general administration expenses expenses for social facilities voluntary social costs and company pension scheme costs are not capitalized. writedowns are recorded to cover inventory risks for reduced usability and technological obsolescence as well as in the context of lossfree valuation of unbilled contracts in constructiontype and service businesses.  allowances on receivables  are determined on the basis of the probability of default and country risks.  deferred tax assets for differences between valuations of balance sheet line items in accordance to commercial and tax law and tax loss carryforwards are recognized if a future tax benefit is expected. deferred tax assets are netted with deferred tax liabilities. recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities comprise temporary differences of assets liabilities and deferred items of entities forming part of the siemens ag tax group and partnerships to the extent that the recovery or settlement of the carrying amount of assets liabilities or deferred items result in a deductible or taxable amount in the taxable profit loss of siemens ag.  offsetting of assets and of income and expenses  siemens ag measures assets at fair value that are designated as being held exclusively to settle specified pension obligations and obligations for early retirement altersteilzeit arrangements and which cannot be accessed by other creditors.  pensions and similar commitments  siemens ag

121,annual financial statements   entitlements resulting from plans based on asset returns from underlying assets are generally measured at the fair value of the underlying assets at the balance sheet date. if the performance of the underlying assets is lower than a guaranteed return the pension provision is measured by projecting forward the contributions at the guaranteed fixed return and discounting to a present value.  according to the act on the improvement of company pensions gesetz zur verbesserung der betrieblichen altersversorgung siemens ag is secondarily liable for pension benefits provided under an indirect pension funding vehicle mittelbarer durchführungsweg. siemens ag recognizes the underfunding in the item provisions for pensions and similar commitments as far as the respective assets of the pension fund or of the pension and support fund pensions und unterstützungskasse do not cover the settlement amount of the respective pension obligations.  other provisions  are recognized in an appropriate and sufficient amount to cover individual obligations for all identifiable risks relating to liabilities of uncertain timing and amount and for anticipated losses on onerous contracts taking account of price and cost increases expected to arise in the future. provisions for agreed personnel restructuring measures were recognized for legal and constructive obligations. significant provisions with a remaining term of more than one year are discounted using a discount rate which corresponds to the average market interest rate appropriate for the remaining term of the obligations as calculated and published by deutsche bundesbank.  foreign currency translation  receivables other current assets securities cash and cash equivalents provisions and liabilities excluding advance payments received on orders as well as commitments and contingencies denominated in foreign currency are generally measured applying the mean spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. balance sheet line items denominated in foreign currency which are part of a valuation unit used to hedge foreign currency risk are measured using the mean spot exchange rate on the transaction date. noncurrent assets and inventories acquired in foreign currency are generally measured applying the mean spot exchange rate on the transaction date.  guarantees and other commitments  siemens ag issues parent company guarantees i.e. guarantees to ensure performance obligations incurred from the delivery of goods or provision of services by affiliated and longterm investee companies or their parent companies. for measurement purposes the contract amount of the secured delivery or service agreement is reduced using the straightline method over the planned term of the delivery or service agreement unless there are reasons for a different risk assessment and an increased liability amount riskadequate liability amount. credit lines included in the guarantee obligations in the context of financing affiliated companies are recognized at their nominal amount.  derivative financial instruments  are used by siemens ag almost exclusively for hedging purposes and  if the relevant conditions are met  are aggregated with the underlying hedged item into valuation units. when a valuation unit is created changes in values or cash flows from the hedged item and hedging contract are compared. a provision is recognized only for a negative surplus from the ineffective part of the market value changes. the unrealized gains and losses from the effective part offset each other completely and are not recognized in the balance sheet or the income statement.  classification of items in the annual financial statements  siemens ag aggregates individual

chapter . of the combined management report and the content of the corporate governance statement.  pursuant to sec.   sentence  hgb we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the annual financial statements and of the management report.  basis for the opinions  we conducted our audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report in accordance with sec.  hgb and the eu audit regulation no  referred to subsequently as eu audit regulation and in compliance with german generally accepted standards for financial statement audits promulgated by the institut der wirtschaftsprüfer institute of public auditors in germany idw. in conducting the audit of the annual financial statements we also complied with international standards

the management report section of our auditors report. we are independent of the company in accordance with the requirements of european law and german commercial and professional law and we have

nonaudit services prohibited under art.   of the eu audit regulation. we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the annual financial statements and on the management report.  key audit matters in the audit of the annual financial statements  key audit matters are those matters that in our professional judgment were of most significance in our audit of the annual financial statements for the fiscal year from october   to september  . these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the annual financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.  below we describe what we consider to be the key audit matters  valuation of noncurrent financial assets  reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter  the impairment test and the assessment regarding the need for a reversal of impairment of noncurrent financial assets was a key audit matter as in particular shares in affiliated companies and investments entail a higher risk of material misstatement due to the materiality of these assets as well as the estimation uncertainties and judgments involved in assessing whether there is objective evidence to indicate a lower net realizable value and permanent impairment or a reversal of impairment and the determination of the fair values.  the determination of the fair values of noncurrent financial assets also depends to a large extent on the assessment of future cash inflows and the discount rate applied.  in case of the investment in siemens energy ag in which  are held directly the market capitalization during fiscal  was on average above the book value sometimes significantly. as of september   a reversal of impairment to the stock market price has been recorded following an impairment as of september  .  auditors response with regards to the net realizable values calculated by management and its assessment as to whether an impairment or reversal of impairment is expected to be permanent we examined the underlying processes related to the planning of future cash flows,,,0.3081970994937815,0.3087020917115086,,,0.3158763481762856,,,,,,,,0.2494137669369321,,,,
144,independent auditors report siemens ag   as well as to the calculation of net realizable value obtained an understanding of managements evaluation and also considered external evidence in this regard amongst others on the development of stock market prices.  we assessed the underlying valuation models for the determination of the net realizable value in terms of methodology and reperformed the calculations with the assistance of internal valuation specialists. we further obtained explanations from management regarding material value drivers of the planning and examined whether the budget planning reflects general and industryspecific market expectations. forecast accuracy was assessed on a sample basis using budgettoactual comparisons of historically forecast data with the actual results. the parameters used to estimate net realizable value such as the estimated growth rates and the weighted average cost of capital rates were assessed by comparing them to publicly available market data. we also performed our own sensitivity analyses to assess the impairment risk in the case of a reasonably possible change in one of the significant assumptions.  with regard to the reversal of impairment of the investment in siemens energy ag we have traced the development of the stock market price and assessed the calculation of the reversal of impairment as of september   considering the acquisition costs of the investment.  furthermore we evaluated the disclosures in the notes to the annual financial statements regarding the subsequent events relating to the investment in siemens energy ag.  our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the valuation of noncurrent financial assets as of september  .  reference to related disclosures  with regard to the recognition and measurement policies applied for the impairment of noncurrent financial assets refer to chapter . accounting and measurement principles in the notes to the financial statements and with respect to writedowns and writeups of noncurrent financial assets refer to chapter . notes to the income statement note  income loss from investments net as well as chapter . notes to the balance sheet note  noncurrent assets and with respect to the subsequent events relating to the investment in siemens energy ag refer to chapter . other disclosures note  subsequent events in the notes to the financial statements.  other provisions for legal disputes regulatory proceedings and governmental investigations  reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter  we considered the accounting for other provisions for legal disputes regulatory proceedings and governmental investigations legal proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations to be a key audit matter. these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and require estimates that could have a significant impact on the recognition and measurement of the respective provision and accordingly on assets liabilities and financial performance. the proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations are subject to uncertainties because they involve complex legal issues and accordingly considerable management judgment in particular when determining whether and in what amount a provision is required to account for the risks.  auditors response  during our audit of the financial reporting of proceedings out of or in connection with alleged compliance violations we examined the processes implemented by siemens for identifying assessing and accounting for legal and regulatory proceedings. to determine what potentially significant pending legal proceedings or claims asserted also in connection with joint and several liability are known and to assess managements estimates of the expected cash outflows our audit procedures included inquiring of management and other persons within the company entrusted with these matters obtaining written statements from inhouse legal counsels with respect to the assessment of estimated cash outflows and their probability obtaining confirmations from external legal advisors and evaluating internal statements

positions as well as deferred taxes requires management to exercise considerable judgment and make estimates and assumptions and was therefore a key audit matter. in particular this affects the measurement and completeness of uncertain tax positions as well as the recoverability of deferred tax assets.  auditors response  with the assistance of internal tax specialists who have knowledge of tax law we examined the processes installed by management for the identification recognition and measurement of tax positions.  in the course of our audit procedures relating to uncertain tax positions we evaluated whether managements assessment of the tax implications of significant business transactions or events in fiscal year  which could result in uncertain tax positions or influence the measurement of existing uncertain tax positions was in compliance with tax law. in particular this includes the tax implications arising from cross border matters such as the determination of transfer prices the results of tax field audits the acquisition or disposal of company shares and corporate intragroup restructuring activities. in order to assess measurement and completeness of uncertain tax positions we also obtained confirmations from external tax advisors. further we evaluated managements assessments with respect to the prospects of success of appeal and tax court

154,compensation report   a. fiscal  in retrospect  fiscal    a. fiscal   in retrospect  what did the economic and political environment look like at the start of fiscal   siemens ag began fiscal  spurred by a strong performance in fiscal . however the economic and political environment still contained a large number of uncertainties. although new variants of the coronavirus did not produce the negative impacts fear ed and a crisis in gas and electricity supplies failed to materialize the economic situation began to weaken  particularly in germany the companys home market. the war in ukraine continued as did tensions between the western democracies and china. on t he other hand supply chain pressures eased. due to a sharp increase in inflation all major central banks raised their interest rates to levels not seen since the beginning of the financial crisis in . in eu rope high energy prices burdened economic d evelopment while in the u.s. consumption and the labor market in particular proved to be very resilient despite the interest rate increases. growth in china  which had been strong following the relaxation of covid  restrictions in q of fiscal   slowed due to the normalization of inventories which had built up during the pandemic and as a result of the burdens imposed by the crisis in chinas real estate market. siemens ags markets benefited from high order backlogs positive price development s and customers efforts to become more resilient more competitive and more sustainable.  how is the strategy reflected in managing board compensation  as a leading technology company siemens partners closely with other companies industries and innovators in order to combine the real and the digital worlds. in this context the company focuses on accelerated high value growth. the managing board compen sation determined by the supervisory board fosters the implementation of the companys strategic targets by providing incentives for increasing profit capital efficiency and cash generation. incentives are also provided f or driving the companys digital t ransformation and developing its sustainability related business . in addition s ustainability  as a strategic goal and an expression of siemens social responsibility  is a high priority at siemens. sustainability is managed using the degree framework. introduced in fiscal  this framework addresses sustainability from every ang le and determines siemens ambitions in the sustainability area with systematized measurable and specific long term targets for environment social and governance esg dimensions. degree is an acronym that stands for decarbonization ethics governance resource efficiency equity and employability. the degree framework is continuously developed and adapted to the commitments that siemens has made such as the science based targets initiative.  the key performance indicators applied in long term variable compensation are part of this degree framework co  emissions and digital learning hours

siemens. we achieved excellent financial results in a volatile market environment which on the one hand included destocking by customers and distributors following previously proactive purchasing particula rly in our short cycle businesses and on the other hand included improved supply chain conditions which accelerated revenue conversion from our high order backlog. we raised our outlook
