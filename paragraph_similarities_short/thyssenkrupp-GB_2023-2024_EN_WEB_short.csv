7,thyssenkrupp annual report      to our shareholders  letter to our shareholders   during the first year of existence of decarbon technologies our newest segment we initiated a large number of measures aimed at strengthening the portfolios focus on cuttingedge technologies for the green transformation of industry. although the past fiscal year was marked by slower market development and project deferrals by customers we remain convinced of the anticipated growth opportunities for decarbonization and climate protection solutions in the years ahead. we aim to systematically access this potential and translate it into valuecreating growth. one lever for this can be found in carbonintensive cement production for example. polysius is supplying the key technology for one of the worlds first carbonneutral cement factories in lägerdorf north germany. we and our customer holcim broke ground for this project in april . in addition at the start of october  we signed an engineering order with titan group for one of the largest carbon capture projects ifestos in europe. polysius is planning and will equip the two kiln lines at the kamari cement factory with its oxyfuel carbon ca pture systems. also in the past fiscal year polysius successfully completed the divestment of the industrial business in india. this is a further step in aligning the product and service portfolio for cement plant engineering towards more sustainable business models. our majority investment thyssenkrupp nucera expanded its technology portfolio. the companys alkaline water electrolysis awe process is a proven  and efficient solution for producing green hydrogen on an industrial scale. in order to expand its market position as a global technology leader thyssenkrupp nucera has added the innovative solid oxide electrolyzer cell soec technology to its portfolio. working in a strategic partnership with the fraunhofer institute for ceramic technologies and systems ikts it aims to develop this technology to industrial maturity. alongside the strategic topics we introduced our groupwide apex performance program a year ago as an additional basis for ensuring  the future viability of thyssenkru pp. in the past fiscal year we demonstrated that we can successfully respond to he adwinds from the market with suitable efficiency measures. looking ahead however the figures show  very clearly that considerable further efforts are necessary if we are to achieve the target margins required for the companys transformation  in other words our mediumterm targets. as we can expect little in the way of tailwinds from the markets in the foreseeable future we will be expanding the apex performance program during the current fiscal year focusing especially on structural earnings improvements. to this end our businesses have also identified additional restructuring needs some of which have already been addressed.  the ongoing macroeconomic challenges are shaping our outlook on the current fiscal year as well. we aim to stabilize or slightly increase sales at around  billion. we are seeking to improve adjusted ebit to a figure between  million and  million. due to cash outflows for restructuring and higher investments we expect free cash flow before ma of between  million and  million. by contrast we are targeting a return to profit with net income between  million and  million.,,0.2780186888999126,,,0.3084863616492991,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,thyssenkrupp annual report      to our shareholders  report by the supervisory board   international situation did not become more settled but more unsettled. the middle east conflict triggered by the attack on israel on october   has expanded considerably. there is still no end in sight to the war and violence in ukraine. da ngers and conflicts are flaring up elsewhere in the world as well. all of this is having a significant impact on the global economy on our markets on the reliability of raw materials sources and logistics routes and on the political and social agendas and priorities of both our own country and the european union. a further source of uncertainty is how the outcome of the presidential electi on in the usa and the election year in germany will impact the economy and the stability of the industrial environment. if we look at fiscal year    and the  calendar year it can be seen that the conditions for industry in germany have not improved but have deteriorated further.  we are feeling the impact of this geopolitical and macroeconomic environment in all of our businesses. and the effects on our customers especially those in the steelprocessing industries are similarly dramatic. significant economic dampers are making life difficult for us. at the same time the structural necessities dictated by the politically mandated decarbonization and associated targets are enormous whereas the momentum  in our businesses offering decarbonization solutions to customers is being delayed.  we took difficult decisions sometimes only on the basis of a majority vote which enabled us to press ahead with aligning the structure of the companys businesses to ensure that each of them has the responsibility for its own activities. neither by allowing the steel business to dominate all the other businesses nor by accepting permanent crosssubsid ization within the thyssenkrupp group made or would make a contribution to the reliable future of our businesses. that is why we on the supervisory board decided on further steps towards finding a st andalone solution for th e steel business opening our businesses to new shareholders and attracting new talents to the companys top management levels. we supported the executive board in taking the corresponding steps on its own responsibility.  we strengthened and realigned the executive board team headed by miguel lpez with the appointments of dr. volkmar dinstuhl ilse henne and dr. jens schulte. we thanked dr. klaus keysberg for his many years of service to the company following his decision to leave the thyssenkrupp group after  years in various top management roles in cluding as a member of the executive board since october  and as cfo since april .  cooperation between supervisory board and executive board in fiscal year     the supervisory board regularly advised the executive board on the management of the company and continuously supervised its conduct of business. we satisfied ourselves that the executive boards work complied with all legal and regulatory requirements at all times. the executive board fulfilled its duty to inform. it furnished us with regular written and verbal reports containing uptodate and comprehensive information on all issues of relevance to the company and the group relating to strategy planning business performance the risk situation compliance and the sustainability strategy. this also included information on variances between actual performance and previously reported targets as well as on bu dget variances followup reporting. the executive board continued to report regularly on the development and implementation of sustainability topics. in the committees and in full supervisory board meetings the members of the supervisory board had ample opportunity to critically examine the reports and resolution proposals submitted by the executive board and contribute suggestions. in particular we discussed intensively and examined the plausibility of all transactions of importance to the company on the basis of written and verbal reports by the executive board. on several occasions the supervisory board dealt at length with the,,,,0.3006109975035261,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

229,thyssenkrupp annual report     group financial statements  thyssenkrupp group  notes to the financial statements   the majority of group companies outside germany also provide pension plans for their employees. these plans are in some cases b ased on statutory requirements or collective agreements but in other cases they are provided by the group companies on a voluntary basis. the range of benefits provided under the plans differs widely depending on local arrangements extending from dc plans to finalsalary definedbenefit schemes with regular pension payment.  outside germany pension obligations mainly exist in the form of db plans in the usa great britain and liechtenstein. under st atutory requirements in liechtenstein pension plans have to be offered to all employees in the mandatory social insurance scheme and a re therefore also available to new employees of thyssenkrupp. by contrast the mainly voluntary db plans offered in great britain and the usa have now been closed to new employees and in respect of future se rvice years have been replaced by dc plans. this means that th e obligations under the db plans relate mainly to the vested rights  of former employees and pensio ners. as a rule all active empl oyees in great britain and the majority of employees in the usa no w only accrue company benefit rights under dc plans.  to secure the payment obligations the pension funds outside germany are funded to a much greater extent by externally separate d assets. this is due in part to legal minimum funding standards which require full external funding of the obligations or a fin ancing under a capital funding system. for further information regarding the composition and investment strategy refer to the disclosures of t he plan assets.  material risks associated with the different types of pension plans include above all financial risks as well as risks in the a reas of inflation and biometrics. inflation risks which could lead to an increase in benefit obligations of db plans exist because some of the plans are based on  final salary and in some cases annual pension modules are directly linked to current salaries defined contribution plans. to this extent a  rise in  salaries above the salarycareer trends assumed in the valuation of the obligation would also require a direct increase in the provisions past service effect in the case of final salary pensions  or the future service cost defined contribution plans. in addition further charges could result from the need for a costofliving adjustment in excess of the assumed pension trend during the pension payment phase which would lead to an immediate increase  in the provisions. a significant number of the pension plans i n  germany are required by law to provide a costofliving adjustme nt. a costofliving adjustment may also be required under col lective bargaining agreements or agreed on a voluntarydiscretionary basis. biometric risks can result either from earl y benefit claims risk of sudden changes to the balance sheet after death or invalid ity or from underestimated life expectancies longevity risk and could likewise result in costs to the company due to unexpected increases  in  provisions and early cash outflows. risks from changes to the discount rate are purely balance sheet related i.e. the provisions ar e adjusted directly against equ ity without affecting income. cash outflows are not affected.,,,,,,,,,,,0.3509543593531659,,,,0.2340933510766648,0.2599280325174349,0.1267040200665824,,
