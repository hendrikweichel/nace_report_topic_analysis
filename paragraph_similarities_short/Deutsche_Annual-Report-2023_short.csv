banks products and services to commit financial crime continue to be the subject of regulatory reviews investigations and enforcement actions in  several jurisdictions. the bank continually seeks to enhance the efficacy of its internal control environment and improve its infrastructure to revised regulatory requirements and to close gaps identified b y the bank andor by regulators and monitors.  the bafin ordered deutsche bank in september  to take appropriate internal safeguards and comply with general due diligence obligations to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing and in february  to review the banks group wide risk managemen t processes in correspondent banking and adjust them where necessary. in april  the bafin prolonged previous orders and ordered the bank to adopt further appropriate internal safeguards and comply with due diligence  obligations with regards to regula r client file reviews. this expansion also applies to correspondent relationships and transaction monitoring. the bafin has appointed a special representative to monitor the implementation of the ordered measures as well as to assess and report on the prog ress of the implementation to the bafin.  on september   the bafin ordered deutsche bank ag to take specific measures aimed at preventing money laundering and terrorist financing in order to implement the orders that the bafin issued on september    and february  . the bank has completed the remediation activities that were the subject of this order.  in november  the bafin ordered the bank to take specific measures to improve data processing systems for transaction monitoring and h as threatened to impose financial penalties in case of non fulfillment. there are no new findings in the order however the order sets a binding timeframe for the implementation of measures that were already agreed. to monitor the implementation progress of the agreed measures the mandate of the special representative has been prolonged until  october . the bank will continue to fully cooperate with the  bafin and the special representative and invest the necessary resources to implement these measur es within the deadlines.  in july  the bank entered into a consent order and written agreement with the federal reserve resolving previously disclosed regulatory discussions concerning adherence to prior orders and settlements related to sanctions and embargoes and aml compliance a prior correspondent banking relationship and remedial agreements and obligations related to risk management issues. both the consent order and written agreement require the bank to comply with and effectuate certain remedial  undertakings. to the extent the bank does not comply with such undertakings it may face additional regulatory action including further civil monetary penalties and business restrictions.  on september   dws agreed to cease anddesist orders and civil money penalties to settle sec investigations. these matters related to certain historic processes procedures and marketing practices dws has since addressed or is in the process of addressing.  in october  the bafin imposed a fine for delayed fi ling of suspicious activity reports to the german financial intelligence unit. the publication resulted from an administrative order issued by bafin in this matter on march  . deutsche bank has accepted the fine and the matter is resolved.  as discus sed elsewhere in this document the war in ukraine led to a significant increase in sanctions against russian state entities as well as companies and individuals linked to russia. export control restrictions also have increased the complian ce burden on ba nks. in addition the u.s.s recently enacted executive order  which establishes a new secondary sanctions regime whereby severe measures can be taken against foreign financial institutions facilitating transactions involv ing broad  sectors of the rus sian economy including manufacturing and technology sectors. these secondary sanction measures increase operational burden and regulatory risk for foreign banks with clients that have business operations in or with entit ies in russia. similarly several r egulators imposed further sanctions against individuals and entities with suspected ties to terrorism following hamas attack on israel in october . deutsche bank manages these sanctions with enhanced communications guidance and operational support le d by afcs sanctions  embargoes team. to control this risk transactions are filtered client and counterparty data is screened trade in sanctioned financial instruments is restricted  goods and commodities such as oil subject to trade finance restrict ions are screened in a risk based approach and further

83,deutsche bank   risks and opportunities   annual report   risks     risk management policies  procedures and methods  the group has devoted significant resources to develop its risk management policies procedures and methods including with respect to market credit liquidity operational as well as reputational and model risk. however the bank may not be fully effective in mitigating its risk exposures in all economic or market environments or against all types of risk including ris ks that the bank fails to identify or anticipate. where the group uses models to calculate risk weighted assets fo r regulatory purposes potential deficiencies may also lead regulators to impose a recalibration of input parameters or a complete review of the mod el. deutsche bank has exposure to operational risks arising from potential failures in its internal control environment or errors in the performance of the banks processes e.g. in transaction processing technology failures as well as loss of business continuity which may disrupt deutsche banks business and lead to material losses.  information technology a nd security build the basis for the business operations of deutsche bank complementing processes and organizational structures. the continuously evolving threats along with evolving technology and changes in the business landscape require constant effort s to retain an acceptable level of risk. the bank maintains its ability to operate and protect itself through established security capabilities processes and governance. however the volatile external environment the constant flow of new zero day exploit s and other new vulnerabilities and continued use of platforms that no longer fit into the strategic architecture remain a risk for the stability of the banks technology with the potential of increased service outa ges. the potential impact in case of a s ecurity event could be wide ranging from minor to extreme issues leading to technology failures security breaches unauthorized access as well as loss or destruction of data.  delays in the implementation of regulatory requirements including consumer protection measures and its strategic projects could also have a negative impact on the banks revenues and costs. in addition the group is also exposed to conduct risk comprisin g risks relating to inappropriate business practices including selling products that are not suitable for a particular customer fraud unauthorized trading and failure to comply with applicable regulations laws and internal policies. for example an emp loyees misconduct reflecting fraudulent intent may lead to not only material losses but also reputational damage. conduct risk is elevated owning to increased focus by regulators on misconduct particularly as an indicator of the health of risk management  the bank has implemented controls to monitor and mitigate the risk.  any of the aforementioned risks or events could potentially result in litigation a financial loss disruption of business ac tivities and liability to the banks customers regulatory s crutiny government intervention or damage to its reputation. at the same time managing these and other risks requires continual adaptation of the banks controls.  as a global bank deutsche bank is often in the news. the bank conducts its media dialogue through official teams yet deutsche bank internal information including confidential matters have been subject to external news media coverage. media leaks can have severe consequences for deutsche bank particularly when they involve inaccurate  statements rumors speculation or unsanctioned opinions. similarly clients of deutsche bank can approach the media to express dissatisfaction or raise adverse communication through social media platforms potentially causing widespread reputational impa ct. legitimate negative publication on deutsche bank is addressed with immediate action plans including concrete measures and commitments to clients with timely communication. while the bank has processes in place its ability to protect itself agains t these risks is limited resulting in exposure of financial consequences such as the loss of confidence or business with clients and potential impact to the banks share price.  in the banking industry divergence continues in how financial institutions define portfolio types and asset classes including around esg related themes. there are often no industry or universally accepted definitions particularly with respect to assets intended to be classified as green or esg compliant and differences can be driven b y divergence between a risk management and accounting view. these variances could impact the way external stakeholders assess the underlying risk exposures to such portfolio types and asset classes. if losses would exceed market expectations in a certain p ortfolio type or asset class this could impact the banks reputation and adversely affect deutsche banks planned results of operations and financial targets.  similarly there can be divergence in views when it comes to devising scenarios for e.g. stress  testing purposes or in the context of scenarios applied when assessing potential provisioning requirements for institutional clients on an individual ba sis. as assessments of future developments are naturally exposed to uncertainties there is the risk tha t the future may turn out differently.  in order to manage financial and non financial risk impacts from e.g. geopolitical or other fast developing events deutsche bank utilizes dedicated governance structures including global and regional crisis manageme nt. where relevant additional controls and processes have been and would be employed. this would also entail additional reporting to ensure relevant senior stakeholders including the management board are up to date.,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.2847346045597746,,,,,,
84,deutsche bank   risks and opportunities   annual report   risks     third party vendor management  financial  institutions rely on third party service providers for a range of services some of which support their critical operations. these dependencies have grown in recent years as part of the increasing trend in digitalization of the financial services sec tor which can bring multiple benefits including flexibility innovation and improved operational resilience. however if not prope rly managed disruption to critical services or service providers could pose risks to financial institutions and in some cases financial stability.  the regulatory framework for managing third party risk continues to evolve and becomes increasingly complex as regulators seek to address various objectives. there are two main areas of focus including how financial institutions manage their third party risks and how to address the systemic risks caused by concentration of services provided by critical third parties.  the recent examples of the publication of the financial stability board toolkit on enhancing third party risk management a nd oversight the consultation paper on critical third parties issued by the uk regulators and digital operational resilience act dora introduced by eu regulators demonstrate the regulators strong intent to protect the financial stability by addressing  the potential systemic risks caused by the third parties.  deutsche bank has a well established approach to third party risk management from a clear policy and procedure through to centralized risk process for businesses to use when engaging with third par ties. to respond to the increasing regulatory demand deutsche bank is continuously enhancing the banks current control environment. in  the bank achieved improved efficiency a more proportionate approach real time monitoring and better culture of awareness to protect the bank from third party risk.  when using third party service providers the bank remains fully responsible and accountable for complying with all the regulatory obligations including the ability to oversee the outsourcing of critica l or important functions. the bank may face risks of material losses or reputational damage if third parties fail to provide services as agreed with the bank andor in l ine with regulatory requirements.  similar to cybersecurity threats to deutsche bank a  successful cyberattack on a third party vendor could have a significant negative impact on the bank that may result in the disclosure or misuse of client as well as proprietary information damage or inability to access information technology systems fin ancial losses additional costs personal data breach notification obligations reputational damage client dissatisfaction and potential regulatory penalties or litigation exposure  in situations where deutsche bank is the third party service provider the  bank may be exposed to financial risks such as lost revenues costs and expenses associated with the cancellation of the service agreement if deutsche bank were no longer able to benefit from the relationship.  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodw ill is reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that impairment may have occurred.  other intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights and their fair value can be measured reliably. these assets are tested for impairment or their useful lives reaffirmed at least annually. this includes the testing in relation to software impairments.  the determination of the recoverable amount in the imp airment assessment of non financial assets requires estimates based on quoted market prices prices of comparable businesses present value or other valuation techniques or a combination thereof necessitating management to make subjective judgments and a ssumptions. these estimates and assumptions could result in significant differences to the amounts reported if underlying circumstances were to change. impairments of goodwill  and other intangible assets have had and may have a material adverse effect on p rofitability and results of operations.  pension obligations  deutsche bank sponsors a number of post employment benefit plans on behalf of its employees including defined benefit plans. to the extent that the factors that drive the banks pension liabiliti es move in a manner adverse to it or that the banks assumptions regarding key variables prove incorrect or that deutsche banks funding of the pension liabilities does not sufficiently hedge those liabilities the bank could be required to make addition al contributions or be exposed to actuarial or accounting losses in respect of the banks pension plans.,,,,,,,,,,,0.4359706353516387,,0.3010540930308987,,,,,,
85,deutsche bank   risks and opportunities   annual report   risks    deferred tax assets  the bank recognizes deferred tax assets for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial sta tement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases unused tax losses and unused tax credits. to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow al l or a portion of the deferred tax assets to be utilized the bank must reduce the carrying amounts. each quarter the bank re evaluates its estimate related to deferred tax assets which can change from period to period and requires significant management judgment. reducti ons in the amount of deferred tax assets from a change in estimate have had and may in the future have material adverse effects on its profitability equity and financial condition.  technology data and innovation  digital innovation offers market entry opp ortunities for new competitors such as cross industry entrants global high tech companies or financial technology companies. therefore the bank expects its businesses to have an increased need for investments in digital product and process resources to m itigate the risk of a potential loss of market share.  to be able to respond to market developments respond more quickly to client needs and to have more flexibility and to improve it resiliency the bank has decided to migrate a large number of applicati ons to the public cloud through a strategic partnership with google cloud. this partnership with google cloud is a major milestone in the banks digital journey and shows a commitment to embrace new technologies. the objective is to enhance the client expe rience through improved products and services system resiliency and security as well as reducing the cost inefficiencies of running legacy platforms . such a major technology migration requires robust governance and planning including required allocation of funding to manage the risk of security and stability issues. additionally there is significant regulatory interest in this program. als o as with any external service providers the bank must ensure the highest standards of data privacy and security c ontrols to safeguard client and bank information. failure to do so can compromise client trust lead to financial losses and in severe cases regulatory penalties litigation and the obligation to compensate individuals for damage.  reliance on third parti es products and services that support critical operations can affect the banks risk posture because these can be the target of new and evolving information security attacks. this risk along with expanded regulatory requirements has necessitated an inc reased use of technology to better identify information security risks across third parties and where necessary pro actively perform outreach with them.  deutsche bank manages third party information security risks by means of its global third party risk  management program. this program includes an information security policy specifically for third parties that sets forth the banks control object ives and expectations. additionally deutsche bank has a third party risk management process designed to ident ify monitor and mitigate risks arising from working with third parties which includes the banks oversight of third parties operations rela ted to the services provided to the bank. deutsche bank operates in an environment with increasing levels of digi tization and a continually evolving threat landscape related to information security. cyber attacks and other internet crime could result in material losses of client or customer information damage the banks reputation and lead to regulatory penalties an d financial losses.  the bank closely observes relevant technological developments the geopolitical landscape and economic impacts driving security risks and assesses their relevance for potential impact to deutsche bank and the wider financial ecosystem. financially motivated and other cyber attacks like ransomware or denial of service can be observed as a persistent threat across industries and to become more frequent. additional threats are posed by supply chain attacks an increasing frequen cy of critical software vulnerabilities potentially exploited by threat actors zero day exploits and an expanding threat surface introduced by e.g. remote ways of working or the use of cloud services. the  focus areas included besides the common attack scenarios the artificial intelligence and quantum computing.  deutsche bank may face operational risks arising from failures in the control environment including errors in the performance of its processes or security controls as well as loss of data which may disrupt the banks business and lead to material losses. at the same time the bank may also face risks of material losses or reputational damage if services are not provided as agreed or in line with internal standards.  deutsche bank and other f inancial institutions have experienced attacks on computer systems including attacks aimed at obtaining unauthorized access to confidential company or client information damaging or interfering with company data resources or business activities or ot herwise exploiting vulnerabilities in its infrastructure including attacks that occurred at the banks third party providers. deutsche bank group expects to continue to be the target of such attacks in the future. although to date the bank has not experie nced any material business impact from these attacks the group may not be able to effectively anticipate and prevent more material attacks from occurring in the future. accordingly deutsche bank continue s to invest toward the protection of its systems i ncluding data infrastructure devices and applications against such breaches and toward ensuring that its vendors employ appropriate cybersecurity safeguards. these measures however may not be effective against the many security threats deutsche bank g roup faces.,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.266048733894605,,,,,,
86,deutsche bank   risks and opportunities   annual report   risks     deutsche bank is still maturing in its overall data management strategy against its core processes and data sets such as transactional client and reference data. this includes the development and implementation of the banks enterprise archite cture principles across the core technology infrastructure. this is central to deutsche banks wider technology and data strategy enabling business growth and efficiencies while also enhancing the control environment. deutsche banks regulators  are activ ely engaged in ensuring the bank progresses with this component of its strategy. furthermore the bank also faces challenges with respect to embracing and incorporating new and disruptive technologies in conjunction with existing technological architecture  in order to ensure industry standards of information security and customer experience.  major technology transformations in the banks business and infrastructure areas are executed via dedicated initiatives. the benefits of these include it and business c ost reduction control improvements revenue growth through provision of new client features or targeted client growth. program execution risks including talent and financial constraints  dependencies to other programs and key deliverables also referred to as kds  extended implementation timelines or impact of the change related activity on the control environment or functionality issues in the upgraded applications or underlying technology are  carefully managed to partially mitigate the risk of not full y achieving expected benefits.  environmental social and governance  the impacts of rising global temperatures and the associated policy technology and behavioral changes required to limit global warming to no greater than .oc above pre industrial levels  have led to emerging sources of financial and non financial risks. these include the physical risk impacts from extreme weather events and transition risks as carbon intensive sectors are faced with higher costs potentially reduced demand and restricted  access to financing. more rapid than currently expected emergence of transition and  or physical climate risks and other environmental risks may lead to increased credit and market  losses as well as operational disruptions due to impacts on vendors and t he banks own operations. deutsche bank has integrated climate and environmental risk considerations throughout its risk and control frameworks to ensure that risks are identified monitored and managed.  furthermore financial institutions are facing incr eased scrutiny on climate and esg related issues from governments regulators shareholders and other bodies including non governmental organizations leading to reputational risks if the bank is not seen to support the transition to a lower carbon econo my to limit nature related risks such as biodiversity and habitat loss and to protect human rights. this increased scrutiny includes more extensive and prescriptive esg disclosure requirements such as the corporate sustainability reporting directive csr d. the emergence of significantly diverging esg regulatory and  or disclosure standards across jurisdictions could lead to higher costs of compliance and risks of failing t o meet requirements.  deutsche bank is rated by a number of esg rating providers w ith the ratings increasingly utilized as criteria to determine eligibility for sustainable investments and to assess management of esg risks and opportunities. the methodologies and scores used by the different providers can lead to significant divergence in results. should the banks ratings lag peers or materially deteriorate this could lead to negative reputational impacts and reduced investor demand for equity  debt. impro ved ratings may have the opposite effect.  data methodologies and industry standards for measuring and assessing climate and other environmental risks are still evolving or in certain cases are not yet available. this combined with a lack of comprehensive and consistent climate and other environmental risk disclosures  by its clients means that the bank in line with the wider industry is heavily reliant on proxy estimates andor proprietary approaches for its own climate and environmental risk management disclosures.  the high degree of uncertainty that this creates in creases the risk that third parties may assert that the banks sustainability related disclosures constitute greenwashing. positively enhanced disclosure requirements for our clients will reduce reliance on pro xy estimates andor proprietary approaches go ing forwards.  while deutsche bank remains committed to the targets and ambitions outlined in its sustainability deep dive on march    the bank may face headwinds in achieving its aim for    billion  in cumulative esg financing and investment volume s through the end of . if ambitions or targets are missed this could impact among other things revenues and the reputati on of the bank. in addition scarcity of esg assets may reduce deutsche banks ability to issue esg compliant funding. similarly

regulation and the bank recovery and resolution directive brrd aim at reducing the likelihood of another financial crisis enhance the resi lience of institutions under stress and eventually support the long term stability of the financial systems without exposing taxpayers money to losses.  in line with the provisions of the srm regulation and the brrd which were mainly implemented in germa ny by the german recovery and resolution act sanierungs  und abwicklungsgesetz sag deutsche bank maintains a recovery and resolution planning framework designed to identify and manage the impact of adverse events in a timely and coordinated manner.  the bank maintains a group recovery plan specifying measures to restore the financial position following a significant deterioration of its financial situation. the group recovery plan is updated at least annually and approved by the management  board.  the gr oup resolution plan on the other hand is prepared by the resolution authorities rather than by the bank itself. deutsche bank works closely with the single resolution board and the bundesanstalt für finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht bafin who establish the group resolution plan for deutsche bank which is currently based on a single point of entry bail in as the preferred resolution strategy. under the single point of entry bail in strategy the parent entity deutsche bank ag would be recapitalized through a  write down andor conversion to equity of capital instruments common equity tier  additional tier   tier  and other eligible liabilities in order to stabilize the group. within one month after the application of the bail in tool to recapitalize an i nstitution the brrd as implemented in the sag requires such institution to prepare a business reorganization plan addressing the causes of failure and aiming to restore the institutions long term viability. to further support and improve operational c ontinuity of the bank for resolution planning purposes deutsche bank has completed additional preparations such as adding termination stay clauses into client financial agreements governed by non eu law and including continuity provisions into key servic e agreements. financial contracts and service agreements governed by eu law are already covered by statutory laws which prevent termination solely due to any resolution measure.  the brrd requires banks in eu member states to maintain minimum requirements f or own funds and eligible liabilities to make resolution credible by establishing sufficient loss absorption and recapitalization capacity. apart from mrel requirements deutsche bank as a global systemically important bank is subject to global minimum s tandards for total loss absorbing capacity which set out strict requirements for the amount and eligibility of instruments to be maintained for bail in purposes. in particular tlac instruments must be subordinated including so called senior non preferre d debt but also in the form of regulatory capital instruments to other senior liabilities. this ensures that a bail in would be applied first to equity and tlac instruments which must be exhausted before a bail in may affect other senior preferred lia bilities such as senior preferred plain vanilla bonds debt instruments that are structured deposits and derivatives.  in the united states deutsche bank ag is required under title i of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of   the dodd frank act as amended to prepare and submit to the federal reserve board and the federal deposit insurance corporation

components like credit limits  as mentioned below.  the credit rating is an essential part of the banks underwriting and credit process and provides  amongst others  a cornerstone for risk appetite determination on an individual counterparty level credit decision and transaction pri cing as well the determination of regulatory capital demand for credit risk. each counterparty must be rated and each rating has to be reviewed at least annually supported by ongoing monitoring of counterparties. a credit rating is a prerequisite for any credit limit established approved. for each credit rating the appropriate rating approach has to be applied and the derived credit  rating has to be established in the relevant systems. specific rating approaches have been established to best reflect the respective characteristics of exposure classes including specific product types central governments and central banks institutions corporates and retail.  counterparties in the banks non retail portfolios are rated by deutsche banks independent credit  risk management function partly using automated rating systems. given the largely homogeneous nature of the retail portfolio counterparty creditworthiness and ratings are predominately derived by utilizing an automated decision engine. country risk related ratings are provided by enterprise risk management erm risk research.  deutsche banks rating analysis is based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative factors. when rating a counterparty  deutsche bank applies in house assessment methodologie s scorecards and the banks

committee rcrmc chaired  by the head of credit risk management before the models are used for credit decisions and capital calculation for the first time or before they are significantly changed. separately for all model changes and for ne w models an approval by model risk manag ement is required. proposals with high impact are recommended for approval to the group risk committee. furthermore regulatory approval may also be required. the model validation is performed independently of model development by model risk management. th e results of the regular validation processes as stipulated by internal policies are brought to the attention of the rcrmc even if the validation results do not lead to a change.  deutsche bank measures risk weighted assets to determine the regulatory cap ital demand for credit risk using advanced foundation and standard approaches of which advanced and foundation approaches are approved by the banks regulator.  the advanced internal ratings based approach irba is the most sophisticated approa ch available under the regulatory framework for credit risk and allows deutsche bank to make use of the banks internal credit rating models as well as interna l estimates of specific further risk parameters. these methods and parameters represent long used  key components of the internal risk measurement and management process supporting the credit approval process the economic capital and expected loss calculation and the internal monitoring and reporting of credit risk. the relevant parameters include the  probability of default pd the loss given default lgd and the maturity m driving the regulatory risk weight and the credit conversion factor ccf as part of the regulatory exposure at default ead estimation. for the majority of derivative counter party exposures as well as securities financing transactions sft deutsche bank makes use of the internal model method imm in accordance with crr to calculate ead. for most of the banks internal rating systems more than seven years of historical infor mation is available to assess these parameters. deutsche banks internal rating methodologies aim at point intime rather than a through thecycle rating but in line with regulatory solvency requirements they are calibrated based on long term averages of  observed default rates.  the foundation irba is an approach available under the regulatory framework for credit risk allowing institutions to make use  of their internal rating methodologies while using pre defined regulatory values for all other risk parameters. parameters subject to internal estimates include the pd while the lgd and the ccf are defined in the regulatory framework. foundation irba remains in place for some exposures stemming from ex

110,deutsche bank   risk and capital management   annual report   credit risk management and asset quality     description of ifrs  model and methodology  the impairment requirements of ifrs  apply to all credit exposures that are measured at amortized cost or fair value through  other compr ehensive income and to off balance sheet lending commitments such as loan commitments and financial guarantees. for purposes of the banks impairment approach the group refers to these instruments as financial assets.  the group determines its allowance f or credit losses in accordance with ifrs  as follows   stage  reflects financial assets where it is assumed that credit risk has not increased significantly after initial recognit ion   stage  contains all financial assets that are not defaulted but have  experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition   stage  consists of financial assets which deemed to be in default in accordance with deutsche banks policies which are based on the capital requirements regulation crr articl e . the group defines these financial assets as impaired nonperforming and defaulted   significant increase in credit risk is determined using quantitative and qualitative information based on the groups histori cal experience credit risk assessment an d forward looking information   purchased or originated credit impaired poci financial assets are assets where at the time of initial recognition there is objective evidence of impairment and the group purchased at a discount.  the ifrs  impairment approa ch is an integral part of the groups credit risk management procedures. the estimation of expected credit loss ecl is either performed via the automated parameter based ecl calculation using the groups ecl model or determined by credit officers. in bo th cases the calculation takes place for each financial asset individually. similarly the determination of the need to transfer between stages is made on an individual asset basis. the groups ecl model is used to calculate the allowance for credit losse s for all financial assets in stage  and stage  as well as for stage   in the homogeneous portfolio i.e. retail and small business loans with similar credit risk characteristics. for financial assets in the banks non homogeneous portfolio in stage   and for poci assets the allowance for credit losses is determined individually by credit officers.  the group uses three main components to measure ecl. these are probability of default pd loss given default lgd and exposure at default ead. the gro up leverages existing parameters used for determination of capital demand under the basel internal ratings based approach irba and internal risk management practices as much as possible to calculate ecl. these parameters are adjusted where necessary to c omply with ifrs  requirements e.g. use of point in time ratings and removal of downturn add ons in the regulatory parameters. incorporating forecasts of future economic variables into the measurement of ecl influences the allowance for credit losses. i n order to calculate lifetime ecl the groups calculation derives the corresponding lifetime pds from migration matrices that reflect economic forecasts.  in july  the group completed the migration of postbank clients into the it systems of deutsche b ank which resulted in a group wide alignment of the ifrs  impairment model and methodologies while specific models previously applied for postbank were decommissioned. this change in estimate resulted in an immaterial net increase in the groups allowan ce for credit losses.  in september  the group received approval from authorities to align the probability of default pd model for large corporates and leveraged lending with regulatory requirements. the model is used for the determination of capital  demand under the basel internal ratings based approach for internal risk management practices and is leveraged for ifrs  ecl purposes. the related change in estimate reduced the groups ecl as of september   by   million . stage determination and significant increase in credit risk  at initial recognition financial assets are reflected in stage  unless the financial assets are poci. if there is a signif icant increase in credit risk the financial asset is transferred to stage . a significant increase in credit risk is determined b y using rating related and process related indicators. the transfer of financial assets to stage  is based on the status of the borrower being in default. if a borrower is in default all financial assets of the borrower are transferred to stage .  ratin grelated stage  indicators the group compares a borrowers lifetime pd at the reporting date with lifetime pd expectations at the date of initial recognition to determine if there has been a significant change in the borrowers pds and  consequently to a ny of the borrowers transaction in the scope of ifrs  impairment. based on historically observed migration behavior and a sampling of different economic scenarios a lifetime pd distribution is obtained. a quantile of this distribut ion which is defined for each counterparty class is chosen as the lifetime pd threshold. if the remaining lifetime pd of a transaction according to current expectations exceeds this threshold the financial asset is deemed to have incurred a significant increa se in credit ris k and is transferred to stage . the quantiles used to define stage  thresholds are determined using expert judgment are reviewed annually and have not changed since implementation of ifrs . the thresholds applied vary depending on the original credit q uality of the borrower elapsed lifetime remaining lifetime and counterparty class. management believes that the defined approach and quantiles represent a meaningful indicator that a financial asset has incurred a significant increase in credit risk.,0.1619917246048878,,0.2584459135670356,0.273538355111123,,0.2761323846634764,0.3623027398602125,,,,,0.2653374972265009,,,,0.2566281958471235,,,0.2807403433042805
111,deutsche bank   risk and capital management   annual report   credit risk management and asset quality     processrelated stage  indicators are derived via the use of existing risk management indicators which in the banks view represent situations where the credit risk of financial assets has significantly increased. these include borrowers being add ed to the groups watchlist being transferred to workout status payments being  days or more past due or being in forbearance. as long as the condition for one or more of the process related or rating related indicators is fulfilled and the borrower of the finan cial asset has not met the definition of default the asset will remain in stage . if the stage  indicators are no longer fulfilled and the financial asset has not defaulted the financial asset transfers back to stage . in case of performing forborne f inancial assets the probation period is  years before the financial asset is reclassified to stage  which is aligned with regulatory guidance.  if the borrower defaults all transactions of the borrower are allocated to stage . if at a later date th e borrower is no longer in default the curing criteria according to regulatory guidance is applied including probation periods which are at least   months or  year in case of distressed restructurings. once the regulatory cure period or criteria has b een met the borrower will cease to be classified as defaulted and will be transferred back to stage  or stage .  the ecl calculation for stage  distinguishes between transactions in the homogeneous and non homogenous portfolios as well as poci financia l assets. for transactions that are in stage  and in a homogeneous portfolio the group uses a parameter based automated approach to determine the credit loss allowance per transaction. for these transactions the lgd parameters are to a large extent mode lled to be time dependent i.e. consider the declining recovery expectation as time elapses after default. the allowance for credit losses for financial assets in the banks non homogeneous portfolios in stage   as well as for poci assets are determined by credit officers and have to be approved along an established authority grid  up to and including the management board. this allows credit officers to consider currently available information and recovery expectations specific to the borrowers and the fin ancial assets at the reporting date.  estimation techniques for key input factors  the first key input factor in the group ecl calculation is the one year pd for borrowers which is derived from the banks internal rating systems. the group assigns a pd to e ach borrower credit exposure based on a  grade master rating scale for all of the groups exposure.  the borrower ratings assigned are derived based on internally developed rating models which specify consistent and distinct customer relevant criteria an d assign a rating grade based on a specific set of criteria as given for a certain customer. the set of criteria is generated from information sets relevant for the respective customer segments including general customer behavior financial and external da ta e.g. credit bureau. the methods in use range from statistical scoring models to expert based models taking into account the relevant available quantitative and qualitative information. expert based models are usually applied for borrowers in the expo sure classes central governments and central banks institutions and corporates with the exception of those corporates for which a sufficient data basis is available for statistical scoring models. for t he latter as well as for the retail segment  statistical scoring or hybrid models combining both approaches are commonly used. quantitative rating methodologies are developed based on applicable statistical modelling techniques such as logistic regression.  oneyear pds are extended to multi year pd  curves using through thecycle matrices and macroeconomic forecasts. based on economic scenarios centered around the macroeconomic baseline forecast through thecycle matrices are first transformed into point intime rating migration matrices typically for a two year period. the calculation of the point intime matrices leverages a link between macroeconomic variables and the default and rating behavior of borrowers which is derived from historical macroeconomic variables mevs and rating time series t hrough regression techniques. in a final step multi year pd curves are derived from point intime rating migration matrices for periods where reasonable and supportable forecasts are available and extrapolated based on through thecycle rating migration m atrices beyond those periods.  the second key input factor into the ecl calculation is the lgd parameter which is defined as the likely loss intensity in c ase of a borrowers default. it provides an estimation of the exposure that cannot be recovered in a default event and therefore captures the severity of a loss. conceptually lgd estimates are independent of a borrowers probability of default. the lgd models applied in stages  and  which are based on regulatory lgd models but adjusted for ifrs  req uirements i.e. removal of downturn addon and removal of indirect costs of workout ensure that the main drivers for losses i.e. different levels and quality of collateralization and customer or product types or seniority of facility are reflected as  risk drivers in lgd estimates. in the banks lgd models the group assigns collateral type specific lgd parameters to the collateralized exposure  collateral value after application of haircuts. the lgd setting for defaulted homogeneous portfolios are pa rtially dependent on time after default and are either calibrated based on the groups multi decade loss and recovery experience using statistical methods or for less significant portfolios certain lgd model input parameters e.g. cure rates are determin ed by expert judgement.,,,0.2826430700123318,,0.2887012814732853,0.2960423040797993,,,,,,0.2469982844113712,,,,0.2365311166766648,,,
112,deutsche bank   risk and capital management   annual report   credit risk management and asset quality     the third key input factor is the exposure at default over the lifetime of a financial asset which is modelled taking into ac count expected repayment profiles e.g. linear amortization annuities bullet loan structures. prepayment options are modelled for some portfolios. the bank applies specific credit conversion factors ccfs in order to calculate an ead value. conceptually  the ead is defined as the expected amount of the credit exposure to a borrower at  the time of its default. in instances where a transaction involves an unused limit a percentage share of this unused limit is added to the outstanding amount in order t o appropriately reflect the expected outstanding amount in case of a borrowers defaul t. this reflects the assumption that for commitments the utilization at the time of default might be higher than the current outstanding balance. in case a transacti on involves an additional contingent component i.e. guarantees a further percentage sha re is applied as part of the ccf model in order to estimate the amount of guarantees drawn in case of default. the calibrations of such parameters are based on internal historical data and are either based on empirical analysis or supported by expert judge ment and consider borrower and product type specifics. where supervisory ccf values need to be applied for regulatory purposes internal estimates are used for ifrs .  expected lifetime  ifrs  requires the determination of lifetime ecl for which the expec ted lifetime of a financial asset is a key input factor. lifetime ecl represent default events over the expected life of a financial asset. the group measures ecl considering the risk of default over the maximum contractual period including any borrowers  extension options over which the group is exposed to credit risk.  retail overdrafts credit card facilities and certain corporate revolving facilities typically include both a loan and an und rawn commitment component. the expected lifetime of such on demand facilities exceeds their contractual life as they are typically cancelled only when the group becomes aware of an increase in credit risk. the expected lifetime is estimated by taking into consideration historical information and the groups credit ri sk management actions such as credit limit reductions and facility cancellation. where such facilities are subject to an individual review by credit risk management the lifetime for calculati ng ecl is  months. for facilities not subject to individual re view by credit risk management the bank applies a lifetime for calculating ecl of  months.  interest rate used in the ifrs  model  in the context of the ecl calculation the group applies in line with ifrs  an approximation of the effective interest rat e eir which is usually the contractual interest rate. the contractual interest rate is deemed to be an appropriate approximation a s the interest rate is consistently used in the ecl model interest recognition and for discounting of the ecl and does no t materially differ from the eir.  consideration of collateralization in ifrs  expected credit loss calculation  the ecl model projects the level of collateralization for each point in time in the life of a financial asset. at the reporti ng date the model uses the existing collateral distribution process applied in deutsche banks economic capital model. in this model the liquidation value of each eligible collateral is allocated to relevant financial assets to distinguish between collateral ized and uncoll ateralized parts of each financial asset. in the ecl calculation the group subsequently applies the aforementioned lgds for secured and unsecured exposures to derive the ecl for the secured and unsecured part of the exposure separately.  for personal colla teral e.g. guarantees the ecl model assumes that the relative level of collateralization remains stable over time. in the case of an amortizing loan the outstanding exposure and collateral values decrease together over time. for  physical collateral e .g. real estate property the ecl shall assume that the absolute collateral value remains constant. in case of an amortizing loan the collateralized part of the exposure increases over time and the loan tovalue decreases accordingly.  certain financial guarantee contracts are integral to the financial assets guaranteed. in such cases the financial guarantee is considered as collateral for the financial asset and the benefit of the guarantee is used to mitigate the ecl of the guarante ed financial asset.,,,,,,0.2755054929187245,,,,,,,,,,0.2363574971619417,,,
115,deutsche bank   risk and capital management   annual report   credit risk management and asse t quality     focus areas in   deutsche banks macroeconomic environment in  was characterized by the persistently high inflation which drove further monetary tightening risks of a higher forlonger interest rate environment and generally tighter financial condi tions in the major advanced economies. towards the end of the year evidence of waning inflation pressure led to a repricing of market expectations with respect to earlier and more significant central bank rate cuts in  accompanied by an easing of fina ncial conditions. in addition there were episodes of significant market volatility particularly around selective failures andor restructurings in the u.s. and european banking sector as well as increasing pressure on the commercial real estate  cre  mark et particularly in the u.s. office sector.  to ensure that deutsche banks ecl model was taking into account the uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment throughout  the group reviewed emerging risks to assess its potential downside and to mana ge the banks credit strategy and risk appetite on an ongoing basis. overall deutsche bank believes the actions taken as a result of these reviews were designated to ensure the bank was adequately provisioned for its expected credit losses as of december  .  commercial real estate  cre markets continue to face headwinds due to the impacts of higher interest rates decreasing market liquidity combined with tightened lending conditions and structural changes in the office sector.  the market stress has been more pronounced in the u.s. where property price indices point to a greater decline of cre asset values from recent peaks compared to europe and apac. similarly within the office segment the market weakness is most evident in t he u.s. reflected in subdued leasing activity and higher vacancy rates compared to europe.  in the current environment the main risk for the portfolio is refinancing risk. cre loans often have a significant portion o f their principal amount payable at ma turity. under current market conditions borrowers may have difficulty obtaining a new loan to repay the maturing debt or fulfil conditions to extend the loan. the group is closely monitoring its cre portfolio for indica tions of elevated refinancing risk.  amidst interest rate hikes commencing in  and real estate market stress increasing the group has proactively worked with borrowers to address upcoming maturities to establish terms for loan amendments and extensions e.g. extensions of terms which i n many cases are classified as forbearance triggering stage  classification under ifrs but are not always modifications according under ifrs. however in certain cases no agreement can be reached on loan extensions or loan amendments and the borrower s inability to obtain refinancing leads to a default. this has resulted in higher stage  ecl for  compared to  and there is continued uncertainty with respect to future defaults and the timing of a recovery in the  cre markets.  the cre portfolio c onsists of lending arrangements originated across various parts of the group and client segments. the groups cre portfolio under the groups cre definition includes exposures reported under the main credit exposure categories by industry sectors for real estate activities nace but also exposures reported under other nace classifications including financial and insurance activities.  within the cre portfolio the group differentiates between recourse and non recourse financing. recourse cre financings typica lly have a lower inherent risk profile based on recourse to creditworthy entities or individuals in addition to mortgage collateral. recourse cre exposures range from secured recourse lending for business or commercial properties to property companies we alth management clients as well as other private and corporate clients.  nonrecourse financings rely on sources of repayment that are typically limited to the cash flows generated by the financed property and the ability to refinance such loans may be con strained by the underlying property value and income stream generated by such property at the time of refinancing.  the entire cre loan portfolio is subject to periodic stress testing under deutsche banks group wide stress test framework. in addition deut sche bank uses bespoke portfolio stress testing for certain sub segments of the cre loan portfolio to obtain a more comprehensive view of potential downside risks. for the year ending december   the group performed a bespoke portfolio stress test o n a subset of the non recourse financing portfolio deemed higher risk based on its heightened sensitivity to current cre market stress factors including higher interest rates declining collateral values and elevated refinancing risk due to loan structure s with a high proportion of their outstanding principal balance payable at maturity.,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3355053904711597,,,,,,,

118,deutsche bank   risk and capital management   annual report   credit risk management and asset quality     since the onset of the cre market deterioration the group aims to assess the downside risk of additional credit losses in it s higher risk non recourse portfolio through a temporary bespoke stress testing focused on stressing pro perty values as main driver of loss severity. stressed values are derived by applying an observed peak totrough market index  decline  a commercial property value market index to the appraised values plus an additional haircut differentiated by property type and region. implying a liquidation scenario the stress analysis assumes a loss to occur on a loan when the stressed property  value is less than the outstanding loan balance i.e. the stress ltv beyond . for the stress analysis performed as of december   the group applied haircuts ranging from  on top of the observed peak totrough m arket index decline for each property type. driven by further deterioration of market conditions especially in the u.s. office sector th e index decline in the fourth quarter increased further compared to the prior quarter.  based on the stress test assump tions and utilizing the december   stress tested cre portfolio of  . billion  as jump off point the stress scenario could result in approximately  . billion  of credit losses over multiple years  based on the respective maturity profile . the stress loss is reported gross of allowance however it should be noted that it covers a portfolio wher e the group has already a credit loss allowance in place. nevertheless the stress loss under a liquidation scenario could exceed the current ecl estimate.  the bespoke stress test has numerous limitations including but not limited to lack of differentiati on based on individual asset performance specific location or asset desirability all of which could have a material impact on potential stress losses. furthermore calculated stress losses are sensitive to potential further deterioration of peak totroug h index values and assumptions about incremental haircuts incremental stress loss can therefore change going forward. changes in underlying assumptions could lead to a wider range of stress results and hence the groups bespoke stress approach is one of m ultiple scenarios.  based on currently available information deutsche bank believes that the ecl estimate related to the groups cre portfolio is within reasonable ranges requires no additional corrective measure and thus represents the banks best estima te. however the group remains highly selective around new business focusing on more resilient property types such as industrial or logistics.  overall assessment of ecls  to ensure that deutsche banks ecl model accounted for the uncertainties in the mac roeconomic environment throughout  the group continued to review emerging risks assessed potential baseline and downside impacts and required actions to manage the banks credit strategy and risk appetite. the outcome of these reviews concluded that the bank adequately provisioned for its expected credit losses as of december   and december  .  results from the above reviews and development of key portfolio indicators are regularly discussed at the credit risk appetit e and management for um and group risk committee. where necessary actions and measures are taken to mitigate the risks. client ratings are regularly reviewed to reflect the latest macroeconomic developments and where potentially significant risk s are identified clients are mo ved to the watchlist stage  forbearance measures may be negotiated and credit limits and collateralization are reviewed. overall the group believes that based on its day today risk management activities and regular reviews of emerging risks it has a dequately provided for its ecl.  however the section below further considers whether any additional overlays were required as of year end .  management overlays applied to the ifrs  model output  the group regularly reviews the ifrs  methodology and pr ocesses key inputs into the ecl calculation and discusses upcoming model changes potential model imprecisions or other estimation uncertainties for example in the macroeconomic environment to determine if any material overlays are required.  in   the   million  overlay related to parameter recalibrations required due to the new definition of default has been released which at first application led to a decrease of allowanc e for credit losses. this overlay was introduced in  when the group implemented the new definition of default which is the trigger for stage . the implementation of the new definition of default mainly affected the private bank where the stage  po pulation in homogeneous portfolios increased. as the change in definition does not materially impact the total loss expectation of these portfolios this change resulted in a n overstatement of stage  provisions as related pd and lgd parameters were not up dated in the model.  the envisaged pd and lgd recalibrations took place in the second half of  after additional empirical data was available to enable the

137,deutsche bank   risk and capital management   annual report   credit risk management and asset quality     the dodd frank act and related commodity futures trading commission cftc rules require ccp clearing in the united states for certain standardized otc derivative transactions includin g certain interest rate swaps and index credit default swaps subject to limited exceptions when facing certain counterparties. the european regulation eu no  on otc derivatives central counterparties and trade repositories emir and the commis sion delegated regulations eu  eu  and eu  based thereupon introduced mandatory ccp clearing in the eu for certain standardized otc derivatives transactions. mandatory ccp clearing in the eu began for certain interest rate derivatives on june   and for certain itraxx based credit derivatives and additional interest rate derivatives on february  . article   of emir authorizes competent authorities to exempt intragroup transactions from mandatory ccp clearing  provided certain requirements such as full consolidation of the intragroup transactions and the application of an appropriat e centralized risk evaluation measurement and control procedure are met. the bank successfully applied for the clearing exemption  for a number of its regulatory consolidated subsidiaries with intragroup derivatives including e.g. deutsche bank securities inc. and deutsche bank luxembourg s.a. as of december   the bank is allowed to make use of intragroup exemptions from th e emir clearing obligation for  bilateral intragroup relationships. the extent of the exemptions differs as not all entities enter into relevant transaction types subject to the clearing obligation. of the  intragroup relationships   are relationship s where both entities are established in the union eu for which a full exemption has been granted and  are relationships where one is established in a third country third country relationship. third country relationships require d repeat applicatio ns for each new asset class being subject to the clearing obligation the process took place in the course of . due to brexit the status of some group entities has changed from an eu entity to a third country entity but there h as been no impact for  the bank in respect clearing exemptions.  the rules and regulations of ccps typically provide for the bilateral set off of all amounts payable on the same day and in t he same currency payment netting thereby reducing the banks settlement risk. dependi ng on the business model applied by the ccp this payment netting applies either to all of the banks derivatives cleared by the ccp or at least to those that fo rm part of the same class of derivatives. many ccps rules and regulations also provide for the  termination close out and netting of all cleared transactions upon the ccps default close out netting which reduces the banks credit risk. in its risk measurement and risk assessment processes deutsche bank applies close out netting only to the ex tent deutsche bank believes that the relevant ccps close out netting provisions are legally valid and enforceable and have been approved in accordance with the banks netting policies.  in order to reduce the credit risk resulting from otc derivative trans actions where ccp clearing is not available deutsche bank regularly seeks the execution of standard master agreements such as master agreements for derivatives published by the international swaps and derivatives association inc. isda or the german m aster agreement for financial derivative transactions with the banks counterparties. a master agreement allows for the close out netting of rights and obligations arising under derivative transactions that have been entered into under such a master agree ment upon the counterpartys default resulting in a single net claim owed by or to the counterparty. payment netting may be agreed from time to time with  the banks counterparties for multiple transactions having the same payment dates e.g. foreign exch ange transactions pursuant to the terms of master agreements which can reduce the banks settlement risk. in its risk measurement and risk assessment processes deutsche bank applies close out netting only to the extent deutsche bank has concluded that th e master agreement is legally valid and enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions and the recognition of close out netting has been approved in accordance with the banks netting policies.  deutsche bank also enters into credit support annexes csas to mas ter agreements in order to further reduce the banks derivatives related credit risk. these annexes generally provide risk mitigation through periodic usually daily margining of the covered exposure. the csas also provide for the right to terminate the r elated derivative transactions upon the counterpartys failure to honor a margin call. as with netting when deutsche bank believes the annex is enforceable deutsche bank reflects  this in its exposure measurement.  certain csas to master agreements provide  for rating dependent triggers where additional collateral must be pledged if a partys rating is downgraded. deutsche bank also enters into master agreements that provide for an additional termination event upon a partys rating downgrade. these downgrad e provisions in csas and master agreements usually apply to both parties but in some agreements may apply to deutsche bank only. deutsche bank analyzes and monitors its potential contingent payment obligations resulting from a rating downgrade in its stres s testing and liquidity coverage ratio approach for liquidity risk on an ongoing basis. for an assessment of the quantitative impact of a downgrading of the banks

comprehensive and holistic view of the banks risk profile across risk types.  on a portfolio level significant concentrations of credit risk co uld result from having material exposures to a number of counterparties with similar economic characteristics or who are engaged in comparable activities where these similarities may cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be affected in t he same manner by changes in economic or industry conditions.  deutsche banks portfolio management framework supports a comprehensive assessment of concentrations within its credit risk portfolio in order to keep concentrations within acceptable levels.  risk and portfolio developments are regularly discussed at the credit risk appetite and portfolio management forum which includes representation from across the credit risk management function including the head of credit risk management.  industry risk manag ement  to manage industry risk deutsche bank has grouped its corporate and financial institutions counterparties into various industry sub portfolios. portfolios are regularly reviewed at least on an annual basis. reviews highlight industry developments and risks to the banks credit portfolio review cross risk concentration risks analyze the riskreward profile of the portfolio and incorporate the results of an economic downside stress test. finally this analysis is used to define the credit strategies for the portfolio in question.  in the banks industry risk management framework thresholds are established for aggregate credit limits to counterparties within each industry sub portfolio. for risk management purposes the aggregation of limits across ind ustry sectors follows an internal risk view that does not have to be congruent with nace nomenclature des activities economiques dans la communate europeenne code based view applied elsewhere in this report. regular industry portfolio overviews are prepa red for the enterprise risk committee to discuss recent developments and to agree on risk management actions where necessary.  beyond credit risk the banks industry risk framework comprises of thresholds for traded credit positions while key industry  relevant non financial risks are closely monitored.  country risk management  avoiding undue concentrations from a regional and country perspective is also an integral part of the banks credit risk management framework. in order to achieve this country risk th resholds are applied to countries in non japan asia central eastern europe middle east  africa and latin america as well as selected developed markets countries based on internal country risk ratings. country portfolios are regularly reviewed with the  frequency of review dependent on portfolio size and risk profile as well as risk developments. larger  riskier portfolios are reviewed at least on an annual basis. these review s assess amongst other factors key macroeconomic and political risk developme nts and outlook portfolio composition quality and cross risk concentrations under normal and stress conditions analyze the risk  reward profile of the portfolio. based on this and taking into account the groups risk appetite and strategy country risk  appetite and strategies are set by erm.  in the banks country risk framework thresholds are established for counterparty credit risk exposures in each country to manage the aggregate credit risk subject to country specific economic and political events. these thresholds cover exposures to entities incorporated locally and subsidiaries of foreign multinational corporations as well as companies with significant  economic or operational dependence on a specific country even though they are i ncorporated externally. in addition gap risk thresholds are set to control the risk of loss due to intra country wrong way risk exposure. as such for risk management purposes the aggregation of exposures across countries follows an internal risk view th at may differ from the geographical exposure view applied elsewhere in this report. beyond credit risk the banks country risk framework comprises thresholds for trading positions that measure the aggregate market value of traded credit risk positions. fo r emerging markets thresholds are also set to measure the profit and loss impact under specific country stress scenarios on trading positions across the banks

142,deutsche bank   risk and capital management   annual report   market risk management     internally developed market risk models  value atrisk var  var is a quantitative measure of the potential loss in value of fair value positions due to market movements that should no t be exceeded in a defined period of time and with a defined confidence level.  the groups value atrisk for the trad ing businesses is based on historical simulation model internal model approach predominantly utilizing full revaluation although some portfolios remain on a sensitivity based approach. the approach is us ed for both risk management and capital requiremen ts.  risk management var is calibrated to a   confidence level and a one day holding period. this means we estimate there is a  in  chance that a mark tomarket loss from our trading positions will be at least as large as the reported var. for regula tory capital purposes the var model is calibrated to a   confidence interval and a ten day holding period.  the calculation employs a historical simulation technique that uses one year of historical market data as input and observed correlations between the risk factors during this one year period.  the var model is designed to take into account a comprehensive set of risk factors across all asset classes. key risk factors  are swapgovernment curves index and issuer specific credit curves single equity a nd index prices foreign exchange rates commodity prices as well as their implied volatilities. to help ensure completeness in the risk coverage second order risk factors e.g. money market basis implied dividends option adjusted spreads and precious m etals lease rates are also considered in the var calculation. the list of risk factors included in the var model is reviewed regularly and enhanced as part of ongoing model performance reviews.  the model incorporates both linear and especially for derivat ives nonlinear impacts predominantly through a full revaluation approach but it also utilizes a sensitivity based approach for certain portfolios. the full revaluation approach uses the historical changes to risk factors as input to pricing functions. whi lst this approach is computationally expensive it does yield a more accurate view of market risk for nonlinear positions especially under stressed scenarios. the sensitivity based approach use s sensitivities to underlying risk factors in combination with  historical changes to those risk factors.  for each business unit a separate var is calculated for each risk type e.g. interest rate risk credit spread risk equity r isk foreign exchange risk and commodity risk. diversification effect reflects the fa ct that the total var on a given day will be lower than the sum of the var relating to the individual risk types. simply adding the var figures of the individual risk typ es to arrive at an aggregate var would imply the assumption that the losses in all ris k types occur simultaneously.  the var enables the group to apply a consistent measure across the fair value exposures. it allows a comparison of risk in different businesses and also provides a means of aggregating and netting positions within a portfolio to reflect correlations and offsets between different asset classes. furthermore it facilitates comparisons of the market risk both over time and against the daily trading results.  when using var results a number of considerations should be take n into account. these include   the use of historical market data may not be a good indicator of potential future events particularly those that are extreme  in nature this backward looking limitation can cause var to understate future potential losses  as in financial credit crisis  but can also cause it to be overstated immediately following a period of significant stress as in covid  pandemic   the one day holding period does not fully capture the market risk arising during periods of illiq uidity when positions cannot be closed out or hedged within one day   var does not indicate the potential loss beyond the th quantile   intraday risk is not reflected in the end of day var calculation   there may be risks in the trading or banking book that are not fully captured in the var model either partially captured or missing entirely  the process of systematically capturing and evaluating risks currently not captured in the banks var model has been further developed and improved. an assessment is made to determine the level of materiality of these risks and material risks are prioritized for inclusion in the banks internal model. risks not in var are monitored and assessed on a regular basis throug h the risk not in var rniv framework. this fr amework has also undergone a significant overhaul in  which included the alignment of methodologies with the historical simulation approach which in turn yields a more accurate estimate of the contribution of these missing items and their potential cap italization.  deutsche bank is committed to the ongoing development of the internal risk models and substantial resources are allocated to review validate and improve

events. operational risk includes legal risks but excludes business and reputational risk and is embedded in all banking p roducts and activities. operational risk forms a subset of the banks non financial risks.  deutsche banks operational risk appetite sets out the amount of operational risk it is willing to accept as a consequence of  doing business. the bank takes on oper ational risks consciously both strategically as well as in day today business. while the bank may have no appetite for certain types of operational risk events such as violations of laws or regulations and misconduct in other cases a certain amount of  operational risk must be accepted if the bank is to achieve its business objectives. in case a residual risk is assessed to be outside risk appetite risk reducing actions must be undertaken includ ing remediating the risks insuring risks or ceasing busi ness.  the operational risk management framework is a set of interrelated tools and processes that

156,deutsche bank   risk and capital management   annual report   liquidity risk management     net stable funding ratio  the net stable funding ratio is a regulatory metric for assessing a banks structural funding profile. the nsfr is intended to reduce medium to long term funding risks by requiring banks to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to their on  and offbalance sheet activities. the ratio is defined as the amount of available stable fund ing the portion of capital and liabilities expected to be a stable source of funding relative to the amount of required stable funding a function of the liquidity characteristics of various assets held.  based on risk appetite a nsfr key limit has been  set for the group as well as for all key liquidity entities and liquidity relevant entities subject to a respective regulatory requirement to ensure compliance to it.  liquidity stress testing and scenario analysis  global internal liquidity stress testing and scenario analysis is used for measuring liquidity risk and evaluating the groups short term liquidity position within the liquidity framework. this complements the daily operational cash management process. the long term liquidity strategy bas ed on contractual and behavioral modelled cash flow information is represented by a long term metric known as the funding matrix refer to funding risk management and funding diversification below.  the global liquidity stress testing process is managed by  treasury towards a respective risk appetite. treasury is responsible for the design of the overall methodology the choice of liquidity risk drivers and the determination of appropriate assumpti ons parameters to translate input data into stress testing output. liquidity risk management is responsible for the definition of the stress scenarios. under the principles and policy requirements laid out by model risk management liquidity risk management and model risk management perform the independent validat ion of liquidity risk models and non model estimates. finance liquidity  treasury reporting  analysis and finance  global reporting are responsible for implementing these methodologies and performing the stress test calculation in conjunction with trea sury liquidity risk management group strategic analytics and it.  stress testing and scenario analysis are used to describe and evaluate the impact of sudden and severe stress events on the groups liquidity position. deutsche bank has selected four scena rios to calculate the groups stressed net liquidity position. these scenarios are designed to capture potential outcomes which may be experienced by the group. the most severe scenario assesses the potential consequences of a combined market wide and idio syncratic stress event including downgrades of deutsche bank credit rating. under each of the scenarios the impact of a liquidity stress event over different  time horizons and across multiple liquidity risk drivers covering all business lines and produc t areas and with that all portfolios and balance sheet is considered. the output from this scenario analysis feeds the group wide stress test which considers the impact of scenarios across all risk stripes.  in addition potential funding requirements fro m contingent liquidity risks which can arise under stress including drawdowns on lending facilities increased collateral requirements under derivative agreements and outflows from deposits with a contractual rating linked trigger are included in the ana lysis. subsequently countermeasures which are the actions the group would take to counterbalance the outflows incurred during a stress event are taken into consideration. those countermeasures include the usage of the groups liquidity reserve and gener ating liquidity from other unencumbered marketable assets without causing any material impact on the groups business model.  stress testing is conducted at a global level and for defined entities relevant for liquidity risk management. the stress ana lysis covers an eight week stress horizon which is considered to be the most critical time span during a liquidity crisis requiring that liquidity is actively assessed and steered on a group level. in addition to the consolidated currency stress test further s tress tests are performed for material currencies. on a global level and in the u.s. liquidity stress tests a twelve months period is covered. additionally stress test results are monitored over a twelve month period with specific risk limits if required  by local regulators. ad hoc analysis may be conducted to reflect the impact of potential downside events that could affect the group such as climate  esg related events. relevant stress assumptions are applied to reflect liquidity flows from risk drivers  and onbalance sheet and off balance sheet products. the suite of stress testing scenarios and assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis and are updated when enhancements are made to stress testing methodologies.  complementing the daily liquidity stress  testing the group also conducts regular group wide stress tests run by enterprise risk management which analyze liquidity risks in conjunction with the other defined risk types and evaluate their impact and  interplay to both capital and liquidity positi ons as described in risk and capital framework  stress testing.,,,,,,,,,,,0.4309781141854008,,,,,,,,
157,deutsche bank   risk and capital management   annual report   liquidity risk management     funding risk management and funding diversification  funding management  in line with regulatory guidelines deutsche bank has developed a set of internal indicators to measure its inherent f unding risks. these are considered for steering purposes in addition to the regulatory metric net stable funding ratio.  the group relies on a vast range of funding sources such as e.g. deposits unsecured wholesale funding capital markets issuances and se cured funding. these protect its liquidity position twofold. firstly since stress events may impact funding markets differently maintaining a well diversified funding portfolio will lower the average impact of these. secondly when experiencing liquidity  stress having access to a wide range of funding sources significantly improves the groups ability to tap different funding markets. the diversification across products is complemented by risk thresholds in order to monitor tenor concentration and counte rparty concentration for both secured and unsecured funding sources.  in addition the stability of deutsche bank groups funding position can be negatively impacted by various forms of industry risks. these are typically medium to long term structural tre nds with potentially significant long term impact on the economy and consequently on banks balance sheets. deutsche bank is performing ad hoc analyzes on such emerging risks to assess the impact of such trends on its funding position to ensure that mitiga ting measures will be taken well in time when deemed necessary. in addition treasury evaluates current market access information in its significant funding markets on a regular basis. market access information is compiled monthly and presented to group as set and liability committee.  the groups primary internal tool for monitoring and managing structural funding risk is the funding matrix. the funding matrix assesses the groups structural funding profile over a time horizon beyond one year. to produce the  funding matrix all funding relevant assets and liabilities are mapped into time buckets corresponding to their contractual or modelled maturities. this allows the group to identify expected excesses and shortfalls in term liabilities over assets in each time bucket facilitating the management of potential liquidity exposures.  the liquidity profile is based on contractual cash flow information. if the contractual maturity profile of a product does no t adequately reflect the liquidity profile it is replac ed by modelling assumptions. short term balance sheet items less than one year or matched funded structures asset and liabilities directly matched with no liquidity risk are excluded from the term  analysis.  the bottom up assessment by individual busin ess line is combined with a top down reconciliation against the groups ifrs balance sheet. from the cumulative term profile of assets and liabilities beyond  year long funded surpluses or short funded gaps in the groups maturity structure can be identi fied. the cumulative profile is thereby built up starting from the greater than ten year bucket down to the greater than one year bucket. the funding matrix is also undertaken for material foreign currencies i.e. usd.  to diversify our refinancing acti vities deutsche bank actively uses among others capital markets issuance.  capital markets issuance  the main objective of debt issuance is to raise medium term funding and securing in the most cost optimal manner. debt issuance encompassing senior unsecure d bonds covered bonds and capital securities is a key source of term funding for the group and is managed directly by treasury. at least once a year following endorsement by the asset and liability committee treasury submits an annual long term fundin g plan to the group risk committee for recommendation and then to management board for approval. this plan is driven by global and local funding and liquidity requirements based on expected business development. the groups capital markets issuance portfol io is dynamically managed through annual issuance plans to avoid excessive maturity concentrations.  deutsche bank holds a license to issue mortgage pfandbriefe and maintains a program to issue structured covered bonds. additionally the group continues to run a program for the purpose of issuing covered bonds under spanish law cedulas. in  deutsche bank further diversified its investor base through inaugural transactions in china so called panda bonds. since  the group maintains it s green bond framework which the bank continuously expands to offer green note issuances to both institutional and retail investors. furthermore

change and the transition to a net zero economy from society regulators and the banking sector have led to the emergence of new and increasing sources of financial and nonfinancial risks. these include the physical risks arising from extreme weather events which are growing in frequency and severity as well as transition risks as carbon intensive sectors are faced with higher taxation reduced demand and potentia lly restricted acce ss to financing. these risks can impact deutsche bank across a broad range of financial and non financial risk types.  financial institutions are facing increased scrutiny on climate and broader esg related issues from governments regulators shareholders  and other bodies leading to reputational risks if the group is not seen to support the transition to a lower carbon economy to protect biodiversity and human rights. deutsche bank is reviewing and enhancing its esg risk management frameworks in alignmen t with regulatory guidance and to ensure that we actively manage esg risks and prevent greenwashing. data methodologies and industry standards for measuring and assessing climate and other environmental risks are still evolving or in certain cases are n ot yet available. this combined with a lack of comprehensive and consistent climate and other environmental risk disclosures by its clients means that the bank in line with the wider industry remains partially reliant on proxy estimates and qualitative approaches when assessing these risks which introduces a higher degree of uncertainty into climate related disclosures.  financial institutions are facing increased scrutiny as well as reporting requirements on climate and broader esg related issues from go vernments regulators shareholders and other bodies. this can lead to reputational risks if the bank is not seen to support the transition to a lower carbon economy or is perceived to be heavily involved in the financing of activities har mful to nature or  linked to human rights abuse within supply chains.  certain jurisdictions have begun to develop anti esg measures including requiring financial institutions that wish to do business with them to certify their

250,deutsche bank   notes to the consolidated financial st atements   annual report     material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates     principles of consolidation  the financial information in the co nsolidated financial statements includes the parent company deutsche bank ag together with its consolidated subsidiaries including certain structured entities presented as a single economic unit.  subsidiaries  the groups subsidiaries are those entities which it directly or indirectly controls. control over an entity is evidenced by the groups ability to exercise its power in order to affect any variable returns that the group is exposed to through its involv ement with the entity.  the group sponsors the  formation of structured entities and interacts with structured entities sponsored by third parties for a variety of reasons including allowing clients to hold investments in separate legal entities allowing clients to invest joi ntly in alternative asset s for asset securitization transactions and for buying or selling credit protection.  when assessing whether to consolidate an entity the group evaluates a range of control factors namely   purpose and design of the entity   relevant activities and how these are determined   whether the groups rights result in the ability to direct the relevant activities   whether the group has exposure or rights to variable returns   whether the group has the ability to use its power to affect the amount of its returns  where voting rights are relevant the group is deemed to have control where it holds directly or indirectly more than half of the voting rights over an entity unless there is evidence that another investor has the practical ability to unilaterally direct the relevant activities.  potential voting rights that are deemed to be substantive are also considered when assessing control.  likewise the group also assesses exis tence of control where it does not control the majority of the voting power but has the practical ability to unilaterally direct the relevant activities. this may arise in circumstances where the size and dispersi on of holdings of the shareholders give the  group the power to direct the activities of the investee.  associates  investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. an associate is an entity in which the group has significant influence but not a controlling interest  over the operating and financial management policy decisions of the entity. significant influence is generally presumed when the group holds between  and  of the voting rights. the existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered in assessing whether the group has significant influence. among the other factors that are considered in determining whether the group has significant influence are representation on the board of directors supervi sory board in the case of german stock corporations and material intercompany transactions. the existence of these factors could require the application of the equ ity method of accounting for a particular investment even though the groups investment is l ess than  of the voting stock.  under the equity method of accounting the groups investments in associates and jointly controlled entities are initially recorded at cost including any directly related transaction costs incurred in acquiring the associa te and subsequently increased or decreased to reflect both the groups pro rata share of the post acquisition net income or loss of the associate or jointly controlled entity and other movements included directly in the equity of the associate or join tly controlled entity. the groups share of the results of associates is adjusted to conform to the accounting policies of the group and is reported in the consolidated statement of income as net income loss from equity method investments.  if there is ob jective evidence of impairment an impairment test is performed by comparing the investments recoverable amount which is the higher of its value in use and fair value less costs to sell with its carrying amount.,0.1913657335075113,,,0.3198097219630565,0.2870047432705891,,0.3644359551270089,,,0.3079745301134509,0.4689537664570086,0.2873269135630044,,0.36104251106691,0.2983774745280476,,0.1467412367741032,0.1502116794948724,
251,deutsche bank   notes to the consolidated financial statements   annual report     material accounti ng policies and critical accounting estimates     foreign currency translation  the consoli dated financial statements are prepared in euro which is the presentation currency of the group. various entities in the group use a different functional currency being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.  an ent ity records foreign currency revenues expenses gains and losses in its functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of recognition.  monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the entitys functional curre ncy are translated at the period end closing rate. foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the translation and settlement of these items are recognized in the consolidated statement of income as net gains losses on financial assetsliabilities a t fair value through profit or loss in order to align the translation amounts with those recognized from foreign currency related transactions derivatives which hedge these monetary assets and liabilities.  nonmonetary items that are measured at historic al cost are translated using the historical exchange rate at the date of the transaction. translation differences on non monetary items which are held at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in profit or loss.  for purposes of translation into the presentation currency assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the period end closing rate and items of income and expense are translated into euros at the rates prevailing on the dates of the  transactions or average rates of ex change where these approximate actual rates. the exchange differences arising on the translation of a foreign operation are included in other comprehensive income. for foreign operations that are subsidiaries the amount of exchange differences attributabl e to any noncontrolling interests is recognized in noncontrolling interests.  upon disposal of a foreign subsidiary and associate which results in loss of control or significant influence over that oper ation the total cumulative exchange differences recog nized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.  upon partial disposal of a foreign operation that is a subsidiary and which does not result in loss of control the proportio nate share of cumulative exchange differences is reclassifi ed from other comprehensive income to noncontrolling interests as this is deemed a transaction with equity holders. for a partial disposal of an associate which does not result in a loss of signif icant influence the proportionate share of cumulative excha nge differences is reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss.  interest commissions and fees  net interest income   interest income and expense from all interest bearing assets and liabilities is recognized as net interest income using  the effective interest rate method. the effective interest rate eir is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial asset or a financial liability and of allocating the interest income or expense over the relevant period using  the estimated  future cash flows.  the estimated future cash flows used in the eir calculation include those determined by all of the contractual terms of the asset or liability all fees including commissions that are considered to be integral to the effective interes t rate direct and incremental transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts. however if the financial instrument is carried at fair va lue through profit or loss any associated fees are recognized in trading income when the instrument is initiall y recognized provided there are no significant unobservable inputs used in determining its fair value.  if a financial asset is credit impaired interest revenue is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortized cost amount. the amort ized cost amount of a financial asset is the gross carrying amount of a financial asset after adjusting for any impairment allowance. for assets which are initially recognized as purchased or credit impaired interest revenue is calculated through the use of a credit adjusted effective interest rate which takes into consideration expected credit losses.  the group presents negative interest paid on interest bearing assets as interest expense and interest revenue received from interest bearing liabilities a s interest income.,0.200435025995241,0.2685601443968732,0.2528274084720849,,0.3024549040355459,,0.387743426002611,,0.2325998873285981,0.2879844722398407,,,,0.3410443532107,0.2469703994316207,,,0.1625413946171327,
252,deutsche bank   notes to the consolidated financial statements   annual report     material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates     the group presents interest income and expense calculated using the eir method separately in the groups consolidated statement of income.  commissions and fee income  the group applies the ifrs   revenue from contracts with customers five step revenue recognition model to the recognition of commissions and fee income under which income must be recognized when control of goods and services is transferred hence th e contractual performance obligations to the customer has been satisfied.  accordingly after a contract with a customer has been identified in the first step the second step is to identify the perfo rmance obligation  or a series of distinct performance obligations  provided to the customer. the group must examine whether the service is capable of being distinct and is actually distinct within the context of the contract. a promised service is disti nct if the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and the promise to transfer the service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contr act. the amount of income is measured on the basis of  the contractually agreed transaction price for the performance obligation defined in the contract. if a contract includes a variable consideration the group estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring t he promised goods or services to a customer. income is recognized in profit and loss when the identified performance obligation has been satisfied. the group does not present information about its remaining performance obligations if it is part of a contra ct that has an original expected duration of one year or less.  the group determines the stand alone selling price at contract inception of a distinct service underlying each performance obligation in the contract and allocates the transaction price in pro portion to those stand alone selling prices. the stand alone selling price is the price at which db would sell a promised service separately to a customer on an unbundled basis. the best  evidence of a stand alone selling price is the observable price of a service when the group sells that service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. if the group does not sell the service to a customer separately it estimates  the stand alone selling price at an amount using a suitable method for ex ample in loan syndication transactions the group applies the requirements for recognition of trade day profit and considers the price at which other market participants provi de the same service on an unbundled basis. as such when estimating a stand alone selling price the group considers all information including market conditions that is reasonably available to it. in doing so the group maximizes the use of observable inputs and applies estimation methods consistently in similar circumstances.  the gro up provides asset management services that give rise to asset management and performance fees and constitute a single performance obligation. the asset management and performance fee components are variable considerations such that at each reporting date t he group estimates the fee amount to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised services to the customer. the benefits arising from the asset management services are simultaneously received and consumed by the customer over time. t he group recognizes revenue over time by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation subject to the removal of any uncertainty as to whether it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative amount  of revenue recognized would occur or not. for the management fee component this is the end of the monthly or quarterly service period. for performance fees this date is when any uncertai nty related to the performance component has been fully removed.  loan  commitment fees related to commitments that are accounted for off balance sheet are recognized in commissions and fee income over the life of the commitment if it is unlikely that the group will enter into a specific lending arrangement. i f it is probable  that the group will enter into a specific lending arrangement the loan commitment fee is deferred until the origination of a loan and recognized as an adjustment to the loans effective interest rate.  commissions and fee income predominantly earned from services that are received and consumed by the customer over time administration assets under management foreign commercial business loan processing and guarantees sundry other customer services. the group recognizes revenue from these services over ti me by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation subject to the removal of any uncertainty as to whether it is highly probable th at a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized would occur or not.  commissions and fee income predominantly earned from providing services at a point in time or transaction type services include other securities underwriting and advisory fees brokerage fees local payments foreign currency exchange busines s and intermediary fees.  expenses that are directly related and incremental to the generation of commissions and fee income are presented net in commissions and fee income in the consolidated statement of income. this includes income and associated expense where the group contractually owns the performance obligation i.e. as principal in relation to the service that gives rise to the  revenue and associated expense. in contrast it does not include situations where the group does not contractually own the performance obligation and is acting as agent. the determination of whether the group is acting as principal or agent is based  on the contractual terms of the underlying service arrangement. the gross commissions and fee income and expense amounts are discl osed in note    commissions and fee income.,0.1844772592721808,0.2888422921813561,0.2956436983123441,0.3431727192178503,0.3208917527479269,0.3337178753334131,0.4833319140766143,0.3834331312418269,0.3668703409670606,0.350264660053626,0.4686646671449146,0.3106075393319628,0.3109674523023524,0.4158917516843652,0.2937088562211574,0.2667043873579733,0.1786293520760724,0.1586107763507558,0.3275357611882441
253,deutsche bank   notes to the consolidated financial statements   annual report     material accounting polic ies and critical accounting estimates     financial assets  the group classifies financial assets in line with the classification and measurement requirements of ifrs   where financial assets are classified based on both the business model used for ma naging the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset known as solely payments of principal and interest or sppi. there are three busine ss models available   hold to collect  financial assets held with the obj ective to collect contractual cash flows. they are subsequently measured at amortized cost and are recorded in multiple lines on the groups consolidated balance sheet.   hold to collect and sell  financial assets held with the objective of both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. they are recorded as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income on the groups consolidated balance sheet.   other  financial assets that do not meet the criteria of either hold to  collect or hold to collect and sell. they are recorded as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss on the groups consolidated balance sheet.  the assessment of business model requires judgment based on facts and circumstances upon initial recognition. as part of this assessment the group considers quantitative factors e.g. the expected frequency and volume of sales and qualitative factors such as how the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that busines s model are evaluated and reported to the groups key management personnel. in addition to taking into consideration the risks that affec t the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model in particular the wa y in which those market and credit risks are managed and how managers of the business are compensated e.g. whether the compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected. this assessment results in an asset being classified in either a hold to collect hold to collect and sell or other business model.  if the group holds a financial asset either in a hold to collect or a hold to collect and sell business model then an assess ment at initial recogniti on to determine whether the contractual cash flows of the financial asset are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding is required to determine the financial asset classification. contractual cas h flows that are sppi o n the principal amount outstanding are consistent with a basic lending arrangement. interest in a basic lending arrangement is consideration for the time value of money and the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particul ar period of time. it can also include consideration for other basic lending risks e.g. liquidity risk and costs e.g. administrative costs associated with holding the financial asset for a particular period of time and a pro fit margin that is consis tent with a basic lending arrangement. where cash flows can change over time due to contingent events such as terms where the margin on a loan adjusts depending on the performance of the borrower on certain contractual esg metrics the contingent event an d cash flows are assessed to determine if the instrument cash flows are sppi. the nature of the contingent event and the size of the possible change in cash flows are taken into account in this assessment on an absolute and relative basis compared to the o verall coupon. additionally as part of the sppi assessment where the lending is non recourse in nature then further assessment is made to determine if the cash flows are consistent with sppi which is dependent on the nature of the underlying  the level of  subordination and the contractual cash flows of the instrument held. the group originates and purchases debt instruments from entities issuing multiple tranches of debt. where these instruments meet the definition of a contractually linked instruments the n further analysis is performed on the cash flows and credit risk exposure of the instrument held as well as the underlying collateral held at purchase and can be held in the future.  financial assets at fair value through profit or loss  financial assets ar e classified at fair value through profit or loss if they are held in the other business model because they are either held for trading or because they do not meet the criteria for hold to collect or hold to collect and sell. in addi tion it includes finan cial assets that meet the criteria for hold to collect or hold to collect and sell business model but the financial asset fails sppi or where the group designated the financial assets under the fair value option.  financial assets classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with realized  and unrealized gains and losses included in net gains losses on financial assetsliabilities at fair value through profit or lo ss. interest on interest earning assets such as trading loans and debt securities and dividends on equity instruments are present ed in interest and similar income.  the group applies trade date accounting to financial assets classified at fair value through  profit or loss.  trading assets   financial assets are classified as held for trading if they have been originated acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing them in the near term or they form part of a portfolio of ident ified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short term profit taking. trading assets include debt and equity securities derivatives held for trading purposes and trading loans. this also includes loan commitments that are allocated to the other business model and that are presented as derivatives held for trading.,0.1973151150028177,0.2785671257025962,0.2804000204934055,0.3106973831433482,0.3516094001528097,0.2852996921938889,0.4134071356921487,0.3214871242483339,0.2769224180261935,0.2932233291049326,0.5052231935622843,0.2520869627103252,0.3137350803147047,0.3825094943722736,,0.2283290371219845,0.1458724194519516,0.1604973184887013,0.2983545729639336
254,deutsche bank   notes to the consolidated financial statements   annual report     material accounting policies and critical accounting es timates     nontrading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit and loss  the group assigns any non trading financial asset that does not fall into the hold to collect nor hold to collect and sell business models into the other business model and classifies them as non trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit and loss. this includes predominately re verse repurchase agreements which are managed on a fair value basis. additionally any financial asset that falls into the hold to collect or hold to collect and sell business models for which the contractual cash flow characteristic s are not sppi is class ified by the group as non trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit and loss.  financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss   certain financial assets that would otherwise be measured subsequently at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income may be designated at fair value through profit or loss if the designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency. the group allows the fair value option to be desi gnated only for those financial instruments for which a reliable estimate of fair value can be obtained.  financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income  a financial asset shall be classified and measured at fair value through other comprehensive income fvoci if the financial asset is held in a hold to collect and sell business model and the contractual cash flows are sppi unless designat ed under the fair value option.  the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are recorded in net interest income. realized gains and losses are reported in net gains losses on financial assets at fvoci. generally the weighted average cost method is used to determine the cost of fvoci financial assets.  the group applies trade date accounting to financial assets classified at fvoci.  it is possible to designate non trading equity instruments as fvoci. however this category is expected to have limited usage by the group and has not been used to date.  financial assets at amortized cost  a financial asset is classified and subsequently measured at amortized cost if the financial asset is held in a hold to colle ct business model and the contractual cash flows are  sppi.  under this measurement category the financial asset is measured at fair value at initial recognition. subsequently the carry ing amount is reduced for principal payments plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest method . the financial asset is assessed for impairment under the ifrs   expected credit loss model where provisions are recognized based on expectations of potential credit losses. the groups impairment of financial instruments policy is described further  in the section impairment of loans and provision for off balance sheet positions ifrs  . the group applies settlement date accounting to financial assets measured at amortized cost.  financial assets at amortized cost include predominately loans at amortized  cost central bank funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements securities borrowed and certain receivables presented in other assets.  modification of financial assets and financial liabilities  when the terms of a financial asset are reneg otiated or modified and the modification does not result in derecognition a gain or loss is recognized in the income statement as the difference between the original contractual cash flows and the modified cash flows discounted at the original effective i nterest rate. the modified financial asset will continue to accrued interest at its original eir. when a modification results in derecognition the original instrument is derecognized and the new instrument recognized at fair value.  noncredit related or co mmercial renegotiations where an obligor has not experienced a significant increase in credit risk since origination and has a readily exercisable right to early terminate the financial asset results in derecognition of the origi nal agreement and recognit ion of a new financial asset based on the newly negotiated commercial terms.  for credit related modifications i.e. those modifications due to significant increase in credit risk since inception or tho se where the obligor does not have the readily exerci sable right to early terminate the group assesses whether the modified terms result in the financial asset being significantly modified and therefore derecognized. this assessment includes a quantitativ e assessment of the impact of the change in cash flow s from the modification of contractual terms and additionally where necessary a qualitative assessment of the impact of the change in the contractual terms. where these modifications are not concluded to be significant the financial asset is not derecog nized and is accounted for as a modification as described above.,0.213901345042071,0.2738016985247384,0.3100303741444882,0.2819910847214046,0.3313999539277827,0.2959624162686837,0.4467719695725077,0.31389205762007,0.2399989549509384,0.3191060688383708,0.4674831772793585,0.2645114183301051,,0.3583042779866376,0.2786156497906028,,0.1309948257156477,0.1457579475877518,0.2886496325747124
255,deutsche bank   notes to the consolidated financial statements   annual report     material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates     if the changes are concluded to be significant the old instrument is derecognized and a new instrument recognized. the group then recognizes a credit loss allowance based on  month expect ed credit losses. however if following a modification that results in a derecognition of the original financial asset there is evidence that the new financial asset is credit impaired on initial recognition then the new financial asset should be recogni zed as an originated credit impaired financial asset and initially classified in stage   refer to section impairment of loans and provision for off balance sheet positions below.  when the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated or modified then  the group assesses whether the modified terms result in the financial liability being significantly modified and therefore derecognized. this assessment includes a quantitative assessment of the impact of the change in cash flows from the modification of contractual terms and additionally where necessary a qualitative assessment of the impact of the change in the contractual terms. where these modifications are not concluded to be significant the financial liability is not derecognized and a gain or los s is recognized in the income statement as the difference between the original contractual cash flows and the modified cash flows discounted at the original effectiv e interest rate. where there is derecognition the original financial liability is derecogni zed and the new liability recognized at its fair value.  loan commitments  loan commitments remain off balance sheet unless allocated to the other business model and presented as derivatives held for trading. the group does not recognize and measure changes  in fair value of off balance sheet loan commitments that result from changes in market interest rates or credit spreads. however as specified in the sections impairment of loans an d provision for off balance sheet positions below these off balance she et loan commitments are in scope of the ifrs   impairment model.  financial liabilities  under ifrs   financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method except for financial liabilities at fair value through profit or l oss.  financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss  financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include trading liabilities financial liabilities designated at f air value through profit or loss and non participating investment contracts investment contracts. under ifrs   they are carried at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in net gains losses on financial assets and liabilities a t fair value through profit or loss. for financial liabilities  designated at fair value through profit and loss the fair value movements attributable to the groups own credit component for fair value movements is recognized in other comprehensive income.  the group applies trade date accounting to financial liabiliti es classified at fair value through profit or loss.  interest on interest paying liabilities are presented in interest expense for financial instruments at fair value through pro fit or loss. trading liabilities   financial liabilities that arise from debt i ssued are classified as held for trading if they have been originated or incurred principally for the purpose of repurchasing them in the near term. trading liabilities consist primarily of deriv ative liabilities including certain loan commitments and sh ort positions. this also includes loan commitments where the resulting loan upon funding is allocated to the other business model such that the undrawn loan commitment is classified as derivatives  held for trading.  financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss   certain financial liabilities that do not meet the definition of trading liabilities are designated at fair value through profit or loss using the fair value option. to be designated at fair  value through profit or loss fina ncial liabilities must meet one of the following criteria  the designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency  a group of financial liabilities is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy or  the instrument contains one or more embedded derivatives unless a the embedded derivative does not significantly modify the cash flows that otherwise would be required by the contract or b it is clear with little or no analysis that

256,deutsche bank   notes to the consolidated financial statements   annual report     material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates     investment contracts   all of the groups investment contracts are unit linked contracts that match specific assets held by the group. the contracts oblige the group to use these assets to settle investment contract liabilities. they do not contain significant insurance risk or discretionary participation features. the contract liabilities are determined using current unit prices multiplied by the number of units attributed to the contract holders as of the balance sheet date. as this amount represents fair value the liabilities  have been classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. deposits collected under investment contracts are accounted for as an adjustment to the investment contract liabilities. investment income attributabl e to investment contr acts is included in the consolidated statement of income. investment contract claims reflect the excess of amounts paid over the account balance released. investment contract policyholders are charged fees for policy administration  investment management surrenders or other contract services.  embedded derivatives  some hybrid financial liability contracts contain both a derivative and a non derivative component. in such cases the derivative component is termed an embedded derivative with the non derivati ve component representing the host financial liability contract. if the economic characteristics and risks of embedded derivatives are not closely related to those of the host fina ncial liability contract and the hybrid financial liability contract itself is not carried at fair value through profit or loss the embedded derivative is bifurcated and reported at fair value with gains and losses recognized in net gains losses on financial assetsliabilities at fair value through profit or loss. the host fin ancial liability contract will continue to be accounted for in accordance with the appropriate accounting standard. the carrying amount of an embedded derivative is reported in the same consolidated balance sheet line item as the host financial liability c ontract. certain hybrid financial liability instruments have been designated at fair value through profit or loss using the fair value option.  financial liabilities at amortized cost  financial liabilities measured at amortized cost include long term and s hortterm debt issued which are initially measured at fair value which is the consideration received net of transaction costs incurred. repurchases of issued debt in the market are treated as extinguishments and any related gain or loss is recorded in th e consolidated statement of income. a subsequent sale of own bonds in the market is treated as a reissuance of debt. the group applies settlement date accounting to financial  liabilities measured at amortized cost.  offsetting of financial instruments  financial assets and liabilities are offset with the net amount presented in the consolidated balance sheet only if the group holds a currently enforceable legal right to set off the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basi s or to realize an asset and settle the liability simultaneously. the legal right to set off the recognized amounts must be enforceab le in both the normal course of business and in the event of default insolvency or bankruptcy of both the group and its counterpa rty. in all other situations they are presented gross. when financial assets and financial liabilities are offset in the consolidated balance sheet the associated income and expense items will also be offset in the consolidated statement of income unless  specifically prohibited by an applicable accounting standard.  the majority of the offsetting applied by the group relates to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements. for further information please refer to note  offsetting financial assets and fin ancial liabilities.  determination of fair value  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an arms length  transaction between market participants at the measurement date. the fair value of instruments that are quoted in active markets is determined using the quoted prices where they represent those at which regularly and recently occurring transactions take place.  the group measures certain portfolios of financial assets and financial li abilities on the basis of their net risk exposures when the following criteria are met   the group of financial assets and liabilities is managed on the basis of its net exposure to a particular market risk or ris ks or to the credit risk of a particular c ounterparty in accordance with a documented risk management strategy   the fair values are provided to key management personnel and   the financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss.  this portfolio valuation approach i s consistent with how the group manages its net exposures to market and counterparty credit risks.,0.1850941797841015,0.2479139142070952,0.2614382356950396,0.3024379427217491,0.2811584340079114,0.3129584105024384,0.3662340274804521,0.3122021755231333,0.2710273140349619,0.2941112736475843,0.4575486692151453,0.2510776418986884,0.2554693887499794,,0.2384282968377283,0.2390315032621193,0.1264690597081831,,
257,deutsche bank   notes to the consolidated financial statements   annual report     material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates     critical accounting estimates  the group uses valuation techniques to establish the fair value of instruments where prices quoted in active markets are not available. therefore where possible parameter inputs to the valuation techniques are based on observable data derived from prices of relevant instruments traded in an active market. these valuation techniques involve  some level of management estimation a nd judgment the degree of which will depend on the price transparency for the instrument or market and the instruments complexity.  in reaching estimates of fair value management judgment needs to be exercised. the areas requiring significant management judgment are identified documented and reported to senior management as part of the valuation control process and the standard monthly reporting cycle. the specialist model validation and valuation control groups focus attention on the areas o f subjectivi ty and judgment.  the level of management judgment required in establishing fair value of financial instruments for which there is a quoted pri ce in an active market is usually minimal. similarly there is little subjectivity or judgment required for instru ments valued using valuation models which are standard across the industry and where all parameter inputs are quoted in active markets.  the level of subjectivity and degree of management judgment required is more significant for those instruments valued us ing specialized and sophisticated models and where some or all of the parameter inputs are less liquid or less observable. management judgment is required in the selection and application of appropriate parameters assumptions and modelling techniques. in particular where data are obtained from infrequent market transactions then extrapolation and interpolation techniques must be applied. where no market data are available for a particular instrument then pricing inputs are determined  by assessing other re levant sources of information such as historical data fundamental analysis of the economics of the transaction and proxy information from similar transactions and making appropriate adjustment to reflect the actual instrume nt being valued and current mar ket conditions. where different valuation techniques indicate a range of possible fair values for an instrument then management has to decide what point within the range of estimates appropriately represents the fair value.  further some valuation adjustme nts may require the exercise of management judgment to achieve fair value.  financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are required to be disclosed according to the inputs to the valuation method that are used to determine their fair value. spe cifically segmentation is required between those valued using quoted market prices in an active market level   valuation techniques based on observable parameters level   and valuation techniques using significant unobservable parameters level  . m anagement judgment is required in determining the category to which certain instruments should be allocated. this specifically arises when the valuation is determined by a number of parameters  some of which are observable and others are not. further the classification of an instrument can change over time to reflect changes in market liquidity and therefore price transparency.  the group provides a sensitivity analysis of the impact upon the level   financial instruments of using a reasonably possible alternative for the unobservable parameter. the determination of reasonably possible alternatives requires significant management judgment.  for financial instruments measured at amortized cost which include loans deposits and short and long term debt issued  the group discloses the fair value. generally there is limited or no trading activity in these instruments and therefore the fair  value determination requires significant management judgment.  for further discussion of the valuation methods and controls an d quantitative disclosures with respect to the determination of fair value please refer to note   financial instruments carried at fair value and note   fair value of financial instruments not carried at fair value.,0.1959637777169619,,,,,,,,,,,,0.2621879040296267,,,,,,
258,deutsche bank   notes to the consolidated financial statements   annual report     material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates     recognition of trade date profit  trade date profit is recognized if the fair value of the financial instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss i s obtained from a quoted market price in an active market or otherwise evidenced by comparison to other observable current market  transactions or based on a valuation technique incorporating observable market data. if there are significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation technique the financial instrument is recognized at the transaction price and any profit implied from the valuation technique at trade date is deferred.  using systematic methods the deferred amount is recognized over the period between trade date and the date when the market is expected to become observable or over the life of the trade whichever is shorter. such methodology is used because it reflects  the changing economic and risk profile of the instrument as the market develops or as the instrument itself progresses to maturity. any remaining trade date deferred profit is recognized in the consolidated statement of income when the transaction becomes  observable.  critical accounting estimates   management judgment is required in determining whether there exist significant unobservable inputs in the valuation technique of the underlying financial instrument refer to section determination of fair valu e for management judgment required in establishing fair value of

arising from forecast transactions. all fr eestanding contracts that are considered derivatives for accounting purposes are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet regardless of whether they are held for trading or non trading purposes.  the changes in fair value on derivatives held for trading are included in net gains losses on financial assetsliabilities at fair value through profit or loss.  hedge accounting  ifrs   includes an accounting policy choice to defer the adoption of ifrs   hedge accounting and to continue with ias   hedge accounting. the group decided to exercise this accounting policy choice and did not adopt ifrs   hedge accounting as of january   . the group applies fair value hedge accounting for portfolio hedges of interest rate risk fair value macro hedges  in accordance with the eu carve out version of ias . under the eu ias  carve out fair value macro hedge accounting may be applied to core deposits and hedge ineffectiveness for all fair value macro hedge accounting applications is only recognized whe n the revised estimate of the amount of cash flows in scheduled time buckets falls below the original designated amount of that bucket and is not recognized when the revised amount of cash flows in scheduled time buckets is more than the original designate d amount.  for accounting purposes the group applies the following types of hedges   for hedges of changes in fair value the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset liability or unrecognized firm commitment or a portion thereof attributable to the  risk being hedged are recognized in the consolidated statement of income along with changes in the entire fair value of the derivative. when hedging interest rate risk any interest accrued or paid on both the derivative and the hedged item is reported i n interest income or expense and the unrealized gains and losses from the hedge accounting fair value adjustments are reported in other revenue. hedge ineffectiveness is reported in other revenue and is measured as the net effect of changes in the fair val ue of the hedging instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged item arising from changes in the market rate or price related to the risks being hedged.  if a fair value hedge of a debt instrument is discontinued prior to the instruments maturity because the derivative is terminated or the relationship is de designated any remaining interest rate related fair value adjustments made to the carrying amount of the debt instrument basis adjustments are amortized to interest inc ome or expense over the remaining term of the original hedging relationship. for other types of fair value adjustments and whenever a fair value hedged asset or liability is sold or otherwise derecognized any basis adjustments are included in the calculat ion of the gain or loss on derecognition.,0.2052473441714366,0.262290408840324,0.2539389605350609,,0.2880211701846917,,0.4053519153855314,0.3088073946359552,0.2496283660330207,,,,,0.3300868994598452,,,,0.1497482634416007,
259,deutsche bank   notes to the consolidated financial statements   annual report     material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates      for hedges of variability in future cash flows there is no change to the accounting for the hedged item and the derivative is carried at fair value with changes in value reported initially in other comprehensiv e income to the extent the hedge is effective. these amounts initially recorded in other comprehensive income are subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statement of income in the same periods during which the forecast transaction affects the cons olidated statement of income. thus for hedges of interest rate risk the amounts are amortized into interest income or expense at the same time as the interest is accrued on the hedged transaction.  hedge ineffectiveness is recorded in other income and is measured as changes in the excess if any in the absolute cumulative change in fair value of the actual hedging derivative over the absolute cumulative change in the fair value of the  hypothetically perfect hedge.  when hedges of variability in cash flows attributable to interest rate risk are discontinued amounts remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to interest income or expense over the remaining life of the original hedge relationship unless the hedged transaction is no lon ger expected to occur in which case the amount will be reclassified into other income immediately. when hedges of variability in cash flows attributable to other risks are discontinued the related amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are recl assified into either the same consolidated statement of income caption and period as profit or loss from the forecast transaction or into other income when the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur.   for hedges of the translation adjustments resulting from translating the functional currency financial statements of foreign operations hedges of net investments in foreign operations into the functional currency of the parent the portion of the change in fair value of the derivative due to cha nges in the spot foreign exchange rates is recorded as a foreign currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is effective the remainder is recorded as other income in the consolidated statement of income.  changes in fair value of the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are subsequently recognized in profit or loss on disposal of the foreign operations.  hedging derivatives are reported as other assets and other liabilities. in the even t that a derivative is subsequently de designated from a hedging relationship it is transferred to financial assetsliabilities at fair value through profit or los s. impairment of loans and provision for off balance sheet positions  the impairment require ments of ifrs   apply to all credit exposures that are measured at amortized cost or fvoci and to off balance sheet lending commitments such as loan commitments and financial guarantees. for purposes of the impairment policy below these instruments are r eferred to as financial assets  the determination of impairment losses under ifrs  uses an expected credit loss ecl model where allowances are taken upon initial recognition of the financial asset based on expectations of potential credit losses  at the time of initial recognition.  staged approach to the determination of expected credit losses  ifrs   states a three stage approach to impairment for financial assets that are not credit impaired at the date of origination or purchase. this approach i s summarized as follows   stage   the group recognizes a credit loss allowance at an amount equal to  month expected credit losses for all financial assets. this represents the portion of lifetime expected credit losses from default events that are expec ted within  months of the reporting date assuming that credit risk has not increased significantly after initial recognition.   stage   the group recognizes a credit loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses for those financial  assets which are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. this requires the determination of the ecl based on lifetime probability of default lifetime loss given default and lifetime exposure at defa ult that represents the probability of default occurring over the remaining lifetime of the financial asset. allowance for credit losses are higher in this stage because of an increase in credit risk since origination or purchase and the impact of a longer  time horizon being considered compared to   months in stage  .  stage   the group recognizes a loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses reflecting a probability of default of  via the expected recoverable cash flows for the asset for those financial assets that are credit impaired. the groups definition of default is aligned with the regulatory definition of default. financial assets that are credit impaired upon initial recognition are categorized within stage   with a carrying value already reflecting the lifetime expected credit losses. the accounting treatment for these purchased or originated credit impaired poci assets is discussed further below.,0.1715314342187702,,,,0.2866664924679593,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.1427192440874719,
261,deutsche bank   notes to the consolidated financial statements   annual report     material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates     a financial asset can be classified as credit impaired in stage   but without an allowance for credit losses i.e. no impairment loss is expected. this may be due to the value of coll ateral. the groups engine based ecl calculation is conducted on a monthly basis whereas the case bycase assessment of ecl in stage   for non homogeneous portfolio has to be performed at least on a quarterly basis.  purchased or originated credit impaired  financial assets in stage   a financial asset is considered purchased or originated credit impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment at the time of initial recognition. such credit impaired financial assets are termed poci financial assets. poci financial assets are measured to reflect lifetime expected credit losses and all subsequent changes in lifetime expected credit losses whether positive or negative are recognized in the income statement as a component of the provision for c redit losses. poci financial assets can only be classified in stage  over the life of the financial asset.  write offs the group reduces the gross carrying amount of a financial asset when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. write offs can rela te to a financial asset in its entirety or to a portion of it and constitute a derecognition event. the group considers all relevant information in making this determination including but not limited to   foreclosure actions taken by the group which have  not been successful or have a high probability of not being successful   collateral liquidation which has not or will not lead to further considerable recoveries   situations where no further recoveries are reasonably expected  write offs can take place before legal actions against the borrower to recover the debt have been concluded and a write off does not involve the group forfeiting its legal right to recover the debt.  interest rate used in the ifrs  model  in the context of the ecl calculation the group applies in line with ifrs  an approximation of the eir which is usually the contractual interest rate cir and which does not materially differ from the eir. the cir is deemed to be an appropriate approximation as the interest rate is consisten tly used in the ecl model interest recognition and for discounting of the ecl.  collateral for financial assets considered in the impairment analysis  ifrs  requires cash flows expected from collateral and other credit enhancement to be reflected in the ec l calculation. the following are key aspects with respect to collateral and guarantees   eligibility of collateral i.e. which collateral should be considered in the ecl calculation   collateral evaluation i.e. what collateral liquidation value should be used and   projection of the available collateral amount over the life of a transaction.  these concepts are outlined in more detail in section ifrs   impairment approach in the risk report.  critical accounting estimates   the accounting estimates and jud gments related to the impairment of financial assets is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used can change from period to period and may significantly affect the groups results of operations.  in assessing assets for impairm ents management judgment is required particularly in projecting forward looking information and scenarios in particular in circumstances of economic and financial uncertainty when developments and changes to expected cash flows can occur both with great er rapidity and less predictability. the actual amount of the future cash flows and their timing may differ from the estimates used by management and consequently may cause actual losses to differ from reported allowances.  for those non homogeneous loans i n stage   the determination of the impairment allowance often requires the use of considerable judgment concerning such matters as local economic conditions the financial performance of the counterparty and the value of any collateral held for which ther e may not be a readily accessible market.  the determination of the expected credit losses in stages   and  and for homogeneous loans in stage   is calculated using the groups ecl model. the model incorporates numerous estimates and judgments. the group performs a regular review of the model and underlying data and assumptions. the probability of defaults loss recovery rates and judgments concerning ability of borrowers in foreign countries to transfer the foreign currency necessary to comply with debt r epayments amongst other things are incorporated into this review. management judgement is required over the following critical accounting estimates,,,0.2665577716194224,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.2487216648251922,,,0.2848583418078695
263,deutsche bank   notes to the consolidated financial statements   annual report     material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates     certain otc derivative contracts and most exchange traded futures and option contracts cleared through central clearing counterparties and exchanges have payment or receipt of variation margin on a daily basis that represents legal or economic settlement of the outstanding derivatives present value. this results in derecognition of the associated derivative financia l asset  and financial liabilities.  repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements  securities purchased under resale agreements reverse repurchase agreements and securities sold under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements are treated as collaterali zed financings and are recognized initially at fair value being the amount of cash disbursed and received respectively.  the group allocates reverse repurchase portfolios that are managed on a fair value basis to the other business model under ifrs  and  classifies them as non trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss.  interest earned on reverse repurchase agreements and interest incurred on repurchase agreements is reported as interest income and interest expense respect ively.  securities borrowed and securities loaned  securities borrowed transactions generally require the group to deposit cash with the securities lender. in a securities loan ed transaction the group generally receives either cash collateral in an amount  equal to or in excess of the market value of securities loaned or securities.  the securities borrowed are not themselves recognized in the financial statements. if they are sold to third parties the obligation to return the securities is recorded as a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss and any subsequent gain or loss is included in the consolidated statement of income in net gains losses on financial assetsliabilities at fair val ue through profit or loss. securities lent to coun terparties are also retained on the consolidated balance sheet.  the group records the amount of cash advanced or received as securities borrowed and securities loaned respectively in the consolidated balance sheet.  fees received or paid are reported in i nterest income and interest expense respectively. securities lent to counterparties which are not derecognized from the consolidated balance sheet and where the counterparty has the right by contract or custom to sell or repledge the collateral are disclo sed in note   transfer of financial assets assets pledged and received as collateral.  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and associates and represents the excess of the aggregate of the cost of a n acquisition and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired at th e date of the acquisition.  for the purpose of calculating goodwill fair values of acquired assets liabilities and contingent liab ilities are determined by reference to market values or by discounting expected future cash flows to present value. this discounting is either performe d using market rates or by using risk free rates and risk adjusted expected future cash flows. any noncon trolling interests in the acquiree are measured either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interests proportionate share of the acquirees identifi able net assets this is determined for each business combination.  goodwill on the acquisition of subsid iaries is capitalized and reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that impairment may have occurred. for the purposes of impairment testing goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to cash generating un its cgus which are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets and that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination and consideri ng the business level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. in identifying whether cash inflows from an asset or a group of assets are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets various fact ors are considered including how management monitors the entitys operations or makes decisions about continuing or disposing of the entitys assets and operations.,0.2087197012397783,0.2733802095225633,0.3015154911995226,0.2974326603080218,0.3227230093158925,0.2992402726633607,0.4305115438751487,0.3323927282794729,0.265197864184361,0.3315723107295447,0.4589254352677494,0.3030267896615002,0.2597846317983932,0.3445929686770509,0.261312294180341,,0.1445664383090296,,0.3287518617434991
264,deutsche bank   notes to the consolidated financial statements   annual report     material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates     if goodwill has been allocated to a cgu and an operation within that unit is disposed o f the attributable goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on its disposal.  corporate assets are allocated to a cgu when the allocation can be done on a reasonable and consistent basis. if this is not  possible the individual cgu is tested without the corporate assets. they are then tested on the level of the minimum collect ion of cgus to which they can be allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis.  intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights and their fair value can be measured reliably. intangible assets that have a finite useful life are stated at cost les s any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment  losses. customer related intangible assets that have a finite useful life are amortized over periods of between  and   years on a straight line basis based on their expected useful life. these assets are tested for impairment and their useful lives reaf firmed at least annually.  certain intangible assets have an indefinite useful life and hence are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occur red. costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized if it is probable that future economic benef its will flow to the group and the cost can be measured reliably. capitalized costs are amortized using the straight line meth od over the assets useful life which is deemed to be either three five or ten years. eligible costs include external direct co sts for materials and services as well as payroll and payroll related costs for employees directly associated with an internal use software project. overhead costs as well as costs incurred during the research phase or after software is ready for use are  expensed as incurred. capitalized software costs are tested for impairment either annually if still under development or any time when there is an indication of impairment once the software is in use.  critical accounting estimates   the determination of the recoverable amount in the impairment assessment of non financial assets requires estimates based on quoted market prices pr ices of comparable businesses present value or other valuation techniques such as the cost approach or a combination thereof necessitating management to make subjective judgments and assumptions. because these estimates and assumptions could result in  significant differences to the amounts reported if underlying circumstances were to change the group considers these estimates to be critical.  the quantitative disclosures are provided in note   goodwill and other intangible assets.  provisions  provi sions are recognized if the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events if it is probabl e that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  the amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation as o f the balance sheet date taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.  when some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party for example because the obligation is covered by an insurance policy an asset is recognized if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will b e received.  if the group has a contract that is onerous the present obligation under the contract is recognized and measured as a provision. an onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.  critical accounting estimates  the use of estimates is important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings. the group estimates and p rovides for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated in accordance with ias   provisions contingent liabilities and contingent assets. significant ju dgment is required in making these estimates and the groups final liabilities may ultimately be materially different.  contingencies in respect of legal matters are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with  assurance. significant judgment is required in assessing probability and making estimates in respect of contingencies and the groups final liability may ultimately be materially different. the groups total liability in respect  of litigation arbitratio n and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case bycase basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering among other factors the progress of each case the groups experience and the experience of others  in similar cases and th e opinions and views of legal counsel. predicting the outcome of the groups litigation matters is inherently difficult particularly in cases in which claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages. see note   provisions for further information on  the uncertainties from the groups judicial regulatory and arbitration

and deferred tax consequences of transactions that have been included in the consolidated financial statements using the pro visions of the respective jurisdictions tax laws. current and deferred taxes are recognized in profit or loss except to the extent that the tax relates to items that are recognized directly in equity or other comprehe nsive income in which case the related  tax is recognized either directly in equity or other comprehensive income accordingly.  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences

the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable pro fit will be available against which those unused  tax losses unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences can be utilized.  deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period that the ass et is realized or the liability is settled b ased on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.  current tax assets and liabilities are offset when  they arise from the same tax reporting entity or tax group of reportin g entities  the lega lly enforceable right to offset exists and  they are intended to be settled net or realized simultaneously.  deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilitie s exists and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxing authority on either the same tax reporting entity or tax group of reporting entities.  deferred tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences arising from i nvestments in subsidiaries branches and associates and interests in joint ventures except when the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled b y the group and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable fut ure. deferred income tax assets are provided on deductible temporary differences arising from such investments only to the extent that it is probable that the differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and sufficient taxable income will be availabl e against which those temporary differences can be utilized.  deferred tax related to fair value remeasurement of financial assets classified as fvtoci cash flow hedges and other items which are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income is also credited or charged directly to other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in the consolidated statement of income once the underlying transaction or event to which the deferred tax relates is recognized in the consolidated statement of  income.  for share based payment transactions the group may receive a tax deduction related to the compensation paid in shares. the amount deductible for tax purposes may differ from the cumulative compensation expense recorded. at any reporting date the  group must estimate the expected future tax deduction based on the current share price. the associated current and deferred tax consequences are recognized as income or expense in the consolidated statement of income for the period. if the amount deductib le or expected to be deductible for tax purposes exceeds the cumulative compensation expense the excess tax benefit is recognized directly in equity.  critical accounting estimates   in determining the amount of deferred tax assets the group uses histo rical tax capacity and profitability information and if relevant forecasted operating results based upon approved business plans including a revi ew of the eligible carry forward periods available tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerat ions. the analysis of the historical tax capacity includes the determination as to whether a period of past profits or a history of recent losses e xists at the reporting date. the determination of a period of past profits or a history of recent losses is b ased on the pre tax results adjusted for permanent differences and typically covers the current and the two preceding financial years. each quarter the group re evaluates its estimate related to deferred tax assets.  the group believes that the accounting  estimate related to the deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period and requires significant management judgment. for example tax law changes changes in the historical tax cap acity or variances in future projected operating performance could result in a change of the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset. if the group was not able to realize all or part of its net deferred  tax assets in the future an adjustment to its deferr ed tax assets would be charged to income tax expense or directly to equity in the period such determination was made. if the group was to recognize previously unrecognized deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to its deferred tax asset would be credited to income tax expense or directly to equity in the period such determination was made.,0.1698336965254441,,,,,,0.3808577167044015,,0.248666273830571,0.320864005221415,,,,,0.2707593844999032,,,0.1443521519122266,
266,deutsche bank   notes to the consolidated financial statements   annual report     material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates     the use of estimates is also important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from uncertain income ta x positions. the group estimates and provides for potential losses that may arise out of uncertain income tax positions in accordance with ias  income taxes and ifric  uncertainty over income tax treatment. significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the grou ps final liabilities may ultimately be materially different.  for further information on the groups income taxes including quantitative disclosures on recognized deferred tax assets see note   income taxes.  business combinations and noncontrolling in terests  the group uses the acquisition method to account for business combinations. at the date the group obtains control of the subsidiary the cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the consideration given including any cash or non cash  consideration equity instruments transferred any contingent consideration any previously held equity interest in the acqu iree and liabilities incurred or assumed. the excess of the aggregate of the cost of an acquisition and any noncontrolling interes ts in the acquiree over the groups share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. if the aggregate of the acquisition cost and any noncontrolling interests is below the fair value of the identifiable net assets n egative goodwill a gain is reported in other income. acquisition related costs are recognized as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.  in business combinations achieved in stages step acquisitions a previously held equity interest in th e acquiree is remeasured to its acquisition date fair value and the resulting gain or loss if any is recognized in profit or loss. amounts recognized in prior periods in other comprehensive income associated with the previously held investment would be recognized on the same basis as would be required if the group had directly disposed of the previously held equity interest.  noncontrolling interests are shown in the consolidated balance sheet as a separate component of equity which is distinct from the g roups shareholders equity. the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is separately disclosed on the face of the consolidated statement of income. changes in the ownership interest in subsidiaries which do not result in a change of control a re treated as transactions between equity holders and are reported in additional paid in capital apic.  non current assets held for sale  individual non current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if they are available for immed iate sale in their present condition subject only to the customary sales terms of such assets and disposal groups and their sale is considered highly probable. for a sale to be highly probable management must be committed to a sales plan and be actively  looking for a buyer and has no substantive regulatory approvals outstanding. furthermore the assets and disposal groups must be actively marketed at a reasonable sales price in relation to their current fair value and the sale should be expected  to be completed within one year. non current non financial assets and disposal groups which meet the criteria for held for sale classification are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal and are presented wit hin other assets and other liabilities in the balance sheet. financial assets and liabilities meeting the criteria continue to b e measured in accordance with ifrs . the comparatives are not represented when non current assets and disposal groups are classi fied as held for sale.  property and equipment  property and equipment includes own use properties leasehold improvements furniture and equipment and software operating systems only. right ofuse assets are presented together with property and equipmen t on the groups consolidated balance sheet. own use properties are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. depreciation is generally recognized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. the range of estimated useful lives is  to   years for property and  to   years for furniture and equipment including initial improvements to purchased buildings. leasehold improvements are capitalized and subsequently depreciated on a strai ghtline basis over the shorter of the term of the lease and the estimated useful life of the improvement which generally ranges from  to   years. depreciation of property and equipment is included in general and administrative expenses. maintenance and  repairs are also charged to general and administrative expenses. gains and losses on disposals are included in other income.  property and equipment are assessed for any indication of impairment at each quarterly reporting date. if such indication exists the recoverable amount which is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use must be estimated and an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount. value in use  is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. after the recognition of impairment of an asset the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to reflect the assets revised carrying amount. if an impairment  is later reversed the depreciation charge is adjusted prospectively.,0.2124807772934009,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.3347171940292512,,,,0.1437324861626028,
267,deutsche bank   notes to the consolidated financial statements   annual report     material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates     financial guarantees  financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.  financial guarantees written  the group has chosen to apply the fair value option to certain written financial guarantees that are managed on a fair value basis. financial gu arantees that the group has not designated at fair value are initially recognized at fair value on the date the guarantee is given. subsequent to initial recognition the groups liabilities under such guarantees are measured at the high er of the amount in itially recognized less cumulative amortization and the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle any financial obligation as of the balance sheet date. these estimates are determined by management based on experience with similar transactions and history of past losses.  any increase in the liability relating to guarantees is recorded in the consolidated statement of income in provision for cre dit losses.  financial guarantees purchased  purchased financial guarantees result in reimbursements unde r ias  to the extent that the financial guarantee is entered into to mitigate the credit exposure from debt instruments with htc or htcs business models. this results in recognition of a reimbursement asset for subsequent increases in the expected credi t losses to the extent it is virtually certain that the purchased financial guarantee will reimburse the group for the loss incurred. accordingly when the credit risk of the borrow er significantly deteriorates a reimbursement asset is recognized equal to  the life time expected credit losses and is presented as other assets in the groups consolidated balance sheet. the corresponding reimbursement gain is recognized as a reduction in the provision for credit losses in the groups consolidated statement of income.  purchased financial guarantees entered into to mitigate credit exposure from debt instruments allocated to htc or htcs business models may also be embedded in collateralized loan obligations clos issued by the group. such embedded guarantees a re not accounted for separately as a reimbursement asset and are instead accounted as part of the clos liability held at amortized cost. the group regularly revises its estimated contractual redemption payment including the benefit of such embedded guara ntees from the clo when the credit risk of a borrower covered by the embedded financial guarantee in the clo significantly deteriorates. the revision is based on the life time expected credit losses of the debt instrument to the extent covered by the clo .  purchased financial guarantees entered into to mitigate credit exposure from debt instruments included in the other business model are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.  leasing transactions  the group enters into lease contracts predo minantly for land and buildings as a lessee. other categories are company cars and technicalit equipment.  in calculating the present value of lease payments the group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interes t rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. after the commencement date the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. in addition the  carrying amount of lease liab ilities is re measured if there is a modification a change in the lease term or a change in the lease payments e.g. changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments.  right ofuse assets are as sessed for any indication of impairment at each quarterly reporting date. if such indication exists the recoverable amount which is the fair value less costs of disposal must be estimated and an impairment charge is recorde d to the extent the recoverabl e amount is less than the carrying amount. as right ofuse assets do not have independently generated cash flows to calculate its value in use the group considers any sublease income that could reasonably be earned. after the recognition of impairment of an asset the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to reflect the assets revised carrying amount. if an impairment is later reversed the depreciation charge is adjusted prospectively.,0.1864199878453898,,,0.3250784456173747,0.2875095597081148,0.2774094232763027,0.3850771594936563,0.3014444096274561,0.3143199006776637,0.300093881682693,0.4672340753512595,0.2705418176367853,0.2637663860603737,,0.2488482726155731,0.2245084141406504,0.1504382784681461,0.1455012463503434,0.3179098939627222
268,deutsche bank   notes to the c onsolidated financial statements   annual report     material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates     the group presents right ofuse assets in property and  equipment and lease liabilities in other liabilities.  the group applies the short term lease recognition exemption to its short term leases i.e. those leases that have a lease term of   months or less from the commencement date. it also applies the  lease of low value assets recognition exemption to leases of technicalit equipment that are considered to be low value. lease payments on short term leases and leases of low value assets are recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the lease t erm. employee benefits  pension benefits  the group provides a number of pension plans. in addition to defined contribution plans there are retirement benefit plans accounted for as defined benefit plans. the assets of all the groups defined contribution p lans are held in independently administered funds. contributions are generally determined as a percentage of salary and are expensed based on employee services rendered generally in the year of contribution.  all retirement benefit plans accounted for as d efined benefit plans are valued using the projected unit credit method to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related service costs. under this method the determination is based on actuarial calculations which include ass umptions about demographics salary increases and interest and inflation rates. actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented in equity in the period in which they occur. the majority of the groups benefit plans is funded.  for the groups most significant pension plans in the key countries the discount rate used at each measurement date is set based on a high quality corporate bond yield curve  derived based on bond universe information sourced from reputable thirdparty index data providers and rating agencies  reflecting the timing amount and currency of the future expected benefit payments for the respective plan.  other post employment benefits  in addition the group maintains unfunded contributory postemployment medical plans for a number of current and retired employees who are mainly located in the united states. these plans pay stated percentages of eligible medical and dental expenses of retirees after a stated deductible has been met. the grou p funds these plans on a cash basis as benefits are due. analogous to retirement benefit plans these plans are valued using the projected unit credit method. actuarial gains and losses are recognized in full in the period in which they occur in other compr ehensive income and presented in equity.  refer to note   employee benefits for further information on the accounting for pension benefits and other post employment benefits.  termination benefits  termination benefits arise when employment is terminated b y the group before the normal retirement date or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. the group recognizes termination benefits as a liability and an expense if the group is demonstrably committed to a detailed formal plan without realistic possibility of withdrawal. in the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy termination benefits are measured based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. benefits falling due more than twelve months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to their present value. the discount rate is determined by reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds.  share based compensation  compensation expense for awards classified as equity instruments is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the share based award. for share awards the fair value is the quoted market price of the share reduced by the present value of the expected dividends that will not be received by the employee and adjusted for the effect if any of restrictions beyond the vesting date. in case an award is modified such that its fair value immediately after modification exceeds its fair value  immediately prior to modification a remeasurement takes place and the resulting increase in fair value is recognized as additional compensation expense.,0.1950454463488762,0.3119512113177987,0.2697861162482977,0.3592690119429629,0.3520828466921776,0.3623857301765573,0.37154782672665,0.3523961876858504,0.3327070966351815,0.2870072495187442,0.4847124977120169,0.2883607057191239,0.2905144322815167,0.3342900993981509,0.2909466672184654,0.2801561754687501,0.2119465332157335,0.1693559335576014,0.3486368791425066
269,deutsche bank   notes to the consolidated financial statemen ts  annual report     material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates     the group records the offsetting amount to the recognized compensation expense in additional paid in capital apic. compensation expense is recorded on a straight line basis over the period in which employees perform services to which the awards relate or over the period of the tranches for those awards delivered in tranches. estimates of expected forfeitures ar e periodically adjusted in the event of actual  forfeitures or for changes in expectations. the timing of expense recognition relating to grants which due to early retirement provisions include a nominal but non substantive service period are accelerated by shortening the amortization period of the e xpense from the grant date to the date when the employee meets the eligibility criteria for the award and not the vesting date. for awards that are delivered in tranches each tranche is considered a separate award and amortized separately.  compensation e xpense for share based awards payable in cash is remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date and recognized over the vesting period in which the related employee services are rendered. the related obligations are included in other liabilities until  paid.  other deferred compensation plans  compensation expense for other deferred compensation plans is recorded on a straight line basis over the period in which employees perform services to which the awards relate or over the period of the tranches for t hose awards delivered in tranches. for awards that are delivered in tranches each tranche is considered a separate award and amortized separately. the amount recognized is based on the present value of the amount expected to be paid under the respective p lan and is remeasured at each reporting date. the ultimate cumulative compensation expense recognized equals the cash or the fair value of the respective financial instruments delivered.  government grants  the group recognizes income from government grants when there is reasonable assurance that it will receive the grant and will comply with the conditions attached to the grant. the benefit is recognized in the period in which the grant is intended  to compensate the group for related costs and presented as a  reduction of the related expense.  the group considered the initial benefits that arose from borrowing under tltro iii as government grant from a below market loan under ias  and recognized subsequent benefits in accordance ifrs . since november    all remaining tltro iii operations are indexed to the average applicable key ecb interest rates.  for further information on the benefit recognized by the group from the tltro iii refinancing program see note  net interes t income and net gains losses  on financial assetsliabilities at fair value through profit or loss.  options and forwards on common shares  option and forward contracts on deutsche bank shares are classified as equity if the number of shares is fixed and physical settlement is require d. all other contracts in which deutsche bank shares are the underlying are recorded as financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.,0.1827710453914248,0.2879898407083329,0.2809947283224063,0.2915849195616758,0.300338141420614,0.3105622922299943,,0.3320439265570712,0.333074641633219,0.3310641578271142,0.4413994387403891,0.2665927869234872,0.2765699937808401,0.3523690495479658,0.3526674361095346,0.3031031175180072,0.1770838787374107,0.1489345882452623,0.371317668514876
270,deutsche bank   notes to the consolidated financial statements   annual report     material accounting pol icies and critical accounting estimates     consolidated statement of cash flows  for purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows  the groups cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. such investments include cash and balances at central banks and demand deposi ts with banks.  there are various circumstances in which cash and cash equivalent balances held by an entity are not available for use by the group. examples include cash and cash equivalent balances held by a subsidiary that operates in a country where exchange controls or other legal restrictions apply such that the balances are not available for general use by the group or its  subsidiaries.  the groups assignment of cash flows to the operating investing or financing category depends on the business model  management approach. for the group the primary operating activity is to manage financial assets and financial liabilities . therefore the issuance and management of long term borrowings is a core operating activity which is different than for a non financial company where borrowing is not a principal revenue producing activity and thus is part of the financing category.  the group views the issuance of senior long term debt as an operating activity. senior long term debt comprises structured notes and asset backed securities which are designed and executed by the corporate bank and investment bank business line segments and which are revenue generating activities. the other component is debt issued by treasury which is considered interchangeable with other funding sources. all funding costs are allocated to business activities to establish their profitability.  cash flows related to subordinated long term debt and trust preferred securities are viewed differently than those related to senior long term d ebt because they are managed as an integral part of the groups capital primarily to meet regulatory capital requirements. as a result they are not interchangeable with other operating liabilities but can only be interchanged with e quity and thus are co nsidered part of the financing category.  the amounts shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows do not precisely match the movements in the consolidated balance sheet from one period to the next as they exclude non cash items such as movements due t o foreign exchange translation and movements due to changes in the group of consolidated companies.  movements in balances carried at fair value through profit or loss represent all changes affecting the carrying value. this includes the effects of market m ovements and cash inflows and outflows. the movements in balances carried at fair value are usually presented in operating cash flows.,,0.2580357409265563,0.2506795501126782,0.2951677434033636,0.3175901857239617,0.2877251449222637,,0.2979258171425056,0.2586133509048564,0.2922057276758281,0.483548065136288,,0.2847149751232682,0.3545503247449362,0.2505516458853543,0.2194197565996755,0.1434580808226241,0.1830786908188721,

275,deutsche bank   notes to the consolidated financial statements   annual report     business segments and related information       business segments and related information  deutsche banks segmental information has been prepared in accordance with the management approach which requires presentation of the segments on the basis of the internal management reports of the entity which are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker which is the deutsche bank management board in order to assess the financial performance of the business segments and for allocating resources to  the business segments.  business segments  deutsche banks segment reporting follows the organizational structure as reflected in the groups internal management reporting systems which are the basis for assessing the financial performance of the business segments and for allocating resources to them.  the banks business operations are organized under the divisional structure comprising the following corporate divisions   corporate bank   investment bank   private bank   asset management   corporate  other  the group consists of the following reportable segments corporate bank investment bank private bank asset management and corporate  other.  corporate bank reports revenues in the categories corporate treasury services institutional client services and bus iness banking.  investment bank reports revenues in the categories fixed income currency sales  trading and origination  advisory as well as other.  private bank reports revenues in the categories private bank germany and international private bank. wi thin international private bank revenues are reported in the categories wealth management  bank for entrepreneurs and premium banking. by year end   international private bank materially completed the wind down of the majority of legacy assets and lia bilities associated with sal. oppenheim. remaining assets or liabilities are not expected to have material financial impacts going forward and will be included in the normal course of the client segment wealth management  bank for entrepreneurs. the assoc iated disclosure of specific revenues items was discontinued starting in the first quarter  of .  asset management reports revenues in the categories management fees performance and transaction fees and other.  corporate  other includes revenues costs and resources held centrally that are not allocated to the individual business segments as well as valuation and timing differences that arise on derivatives used to hedge the groups balance sheet. these are accounting impacts and valuation losses are expected to be recovered over time as the underlying instruments approach maturity. in addition corp orate  other contains financial impacts of legacy portfolios previously reported as the capital release unit.  as announced in the annual report  having fulfilled the capital release units de risking and cost reduction mandate from  through year  end  the capital release unit ceased to be reported as a separate segment with effect from the first quarter of . the remaining portfolio resources and employees are reported within the corporate  other segment. in line with the change the cor e bank which previously represented the group excluding the capital release unit ceased to be reported as of the first quarter of .  in addition based on management decisions during the reporting period further divisional changes were introduced.  the prior years segmental information is presented in the current structure.  measurement of segment profit or loss  segment reporting requires a presentation of the segment results based on management reporting methods including a reconciliation between th e results of the business segments and the consolidated financial statements which is presented in the segment results of operations section within this note. the information provided about each segment is based on interna l management reporting about se gment profit or loss assets and other information which is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker.,,0.2782711360104989,,0.2735534606288704,0.2850437005930828,,0.4033799382581238,,,,0.4473044776337983,,,0.3901283185710207,,,0.1572603009113418,0.1826707142995523,0.2850256159445379
276,deutsche bank   notes to the consolidated financial statements   annual report     business segments and related information     segment assets are presented in the groups internal management reporting based on a consolidated view i.e. the amounts do not include intersegment balances. the groups internal management reporting does not consider segment liabilities or interest expense separately. similarly depreciation and amortization tax expenses and other comprehensive income are not presented separately intern ally and are therefore not disclosed here.  nonifrs compliant accounting methods used in the groups management reporting represent either valuation or classification differences. the largest valuation differences relate to measurement at fair value in man agement reporting versus measurement at amortized cost under ifrs and to the recognition of trading results from own shares in revenues in management reporting in investment bank and in equity under ifrs. the major classification difference relates to noncontrolling interest which represents the net share of minority shareholders in revenues provision for credit losses noninterest expenses and income tax expenses. noncontrolling interest is reported as a component of the profit before tax of the busine sses in management reporting with a reversal in corporate  other and a component of net income appropriation under ifrs.  since the groups business activities are diverse in nature and its operations are integrated certain estimates and judgment s have been made to apportion revenue and expense items among the business segments.  the management reporting systems allocate the groups external net interest income according to the value of funding consumed or provided by each business segments activities in accordance with the banks internal funds transfer pricing framework. furthermore to retain comparability with those competitors that have legally independent units with their own equity funding the group allocates a net notional interest benefit on i ts consolidated capital in line with each segments proportion of average shareholders equity.  management uses certain measures for equity and related ratios as part of its internal reporting system because it believes that these measures provide it wit h a useful indication of the financial performance of the business segments. the group discloses such measures to provide investors and analysts with further insight into how management operates the groups businesses and to enable them to better understan d the groups results.  allocation of average shareholders equity  shareholders equity is fully allocated to the groups segments based on the regulatory capital demand of each segment. regulatory capital demand reflects the combined contribution of each  segment to the groups common equity tier   cet ratio the groups leverage ratio and the groups capital loss under stress. contributions in each of the three dimensions ar e weighted to reflect their relative importance and level of constraint for the  group. contributions to the cet ratio and the leverage ratio are measured through risk weighted assets and leverage ratio exposure. the groups capital loss under stress is a measure of the groups overall economic risk exposure under a defined stress sc enario. goodwill and other intangible assets are directly attributed to the groups segments in order to allow the determination of allocated tangible shareholders  equity and the respective returns. shareholders equity and tangible shareholders equity i s allocated on a monthly basis and averaged across quarters and for the full year.  driver based cost management allocations methodology change  as disclosed in the annual report   the group implemented the driver based cost management allocations from the first quarter of . the new methodology aims to provide greater transparency over the drivers of infrastructure costs and links costs more closely to service consumption by segments. this change did not affect the groups costincome ratio and retur n on tangible equity metrics but does impact these per business segment. therefore prior period information is presented in the current structure resulting in an increase in noninterest expenses corresponding decrease in profit before tax for corpora te bank of   million  for investment bank of   million  for private bank of   million  for asset management of   million  with a corresponding decrease in noninterest expenses corresponding reduction in loss before tax for corporate  other o f   million  for the full year .  strategic liquidity reserve profit and loss allocation  commencing from the first quarter of  the methodology for divisional intra year allocations of profit or loss earned on the strategic liquidity reserves ha s been refined. as part of the introduction of the new methodology the intra year profit and loss volatility is held centrally in corporate  other in order to better reflect the underlying performance of the business divisions. the implementation of the new methodology does not impact the overall group revenues or the annual business allocations therefore the full year results for  and  are not impacted.,0.2090489643182295,0.301922121393531,0.2572320393424281,0.2825623505657305,0.3375555149314787,,0.4088810222346091,,0.2495240170747981,0.3090865309307165,,0.2454567715097014,,0.3771006129994795,0.2449048741128683,0.2384332226687091,0.1306374717601696,0.1833142158725067,
277,deutsche bank   notes to the consolidated financial statements   annual report     business segments and related information     u.s. tax exempt securities  net interest income as a component of net revenues profit loss  before tax and related ratios are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis for u.s. tax exempt securities for the investment bank. this enables management to measure performance of taxable and tax exempt securities on a comparable basis. this present ation resulted in an increase in investment bank net interest income of   million  for full year    million  for full year  and   million  for full year . this increase is offset in group consolidated figures through a reversal in corporate  other. the tax rate used in determining the fully taxable equivalent of net interest income in respect of the majority of the u.s. tax exempt secur ities is  for   and .  infrastructure full time employees realignment   in the third quarter of  approximately   ftes moved from corporate  other to the operating business segments driven by the banks decision that the chief operat ing office will no longer be a separate management board function. accordingly business related parts of chief operating office that support the investment bank and the corporate bank which were previously run in infrastructure moved to those divisions.  comparative segmental financial information is presented accordingly. this change did not result in a material financial impact at a segment level as costs are allocated from corpor ate  other to the operating business segments that are using the service  of the respective infrastructure functions and with this move the costs are directly incurred by the divisions rather than being charged to corporate  other.  segmental results of operations  the following tables present the results of the groups business  segments including the reconciliation to the consolidated results of operations under ifrs.       in  m. unless stated otherwise   corporate  bank   investment  bank   private  bank   asset  manage  ment   corporate   other   total  consolidated   net revenues                         provision for credit losses                      noninterest expenses               compensation and benefits                          general and administrative expenses                          impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets                     restructuring activities                     total noninterest expenses                          noncontrolling interests                     profit loss before tax                                       assets in  bn                     loans gross of allowance for loan losses in  bn                    additions to non current assets                       deposits in  bn                    average allocated shareholders equity                                         riskweighted assets in  bn                    of which operational risk rwa in  bn                    leverage exposure in  bn                     employees full time equivalent                           posttax return on average shareholders equity  .   .   .   .    nm  .   posttax return on average tangible shareholders equity  .   .   .   .    nm  .   costincome ratio  .   .   .   .   nm  .                  includes               net interest income                         net income loss from equity method investments                      includes               equity method investments                                    nm  not meaningful   the post tax return on average shareholders equity and average tangible shareholders equity at the group level reflects the reported effective tax rate for the group which was   for the year ended december    for the post tax return on average shareholders equity and average tangible shareholders equity o f the segments the group effective tax rate was adjusted to exclude the impact of permanent differences not attributed to the segments so that the se gment tax rates were  for the year ended december    for further information please refer to  supplementary information unaudited non gaap financial measures of this report   noninterest expenses as a percentage of total net revenues which are defined as net interest income before provision for cre dit losses plus noninterest income,0.1914345901559445,0.2870696169501589,,0.2925801475809573,0.2906172593030623,,0.3978607694445961,,,0.3005716986691386,0.4389877244834996,,,0.3726221743871074,0.2682127573024245,,0.1424046916320706,0.1834003577936158,

control  the group has an established valuation control framework which governs internal control standards methodologies and procedures over the valuation process.  prices quoted in active markets   the fair value of instruments that are quoted in active markets are determined using the quoted prices where they represent prices at which regularly and recently occurring transactions take place.  valuation techniques  the group uses valuation techniques to establish the fair value of instruments where prices quoted in active markets are not available. valuation techniques used for financial instruments include modelling techniques the u se of indicative quotes for proxy instruments quotes fr om recent and less regular transactions and broker quotes.  for some financial instruments a rate or other parameter rather than a price is quoted. where this is the case then the mar ket rate or parameter is used as an input to a valuation model to determ ine fair value. for some instruments modelling techniques follow industry standard models for example discounted cash flow analysis and standard option pricing models. these models are dependent upon estimated future cash flows discount factors and vol atility levels. for more complex or unique instruments more sophisticated modelling techniques are required and may rely upon assumptions or more complex parameters such as correlations prepayment speeds default rates and loss severity.  frequently val uation models require multiple parameter inputs. where possible parameter inputs are based on observable data or are derived from the prices of relevant instruments traded in active markets. where observable data is not available for parameter inputs the n other market information is considered. for example indicative broker quotes and consensus pricing information are used to support parameter inputs where they are available. where no observable information is available to support parameter inputs then t hey are based on other relevant sources of information such as prices for similar transactions historic data economic fundamentals and research information with appropriate adjustment to reflect the term s of the actual instrument being valued and curre nt market conditions.  valuation adjustments   valuation adjustments are an integral part of the valuation process. in making appropriate valuation adjustments the group follows methodologies that consider factors such as bid offer spreads counterpartyow n credit and funding risk. bid offer spread valuation adjustments are required to adjust mid market valuations to the appropriate bid or offer valuation. the bid or offer valuation is the best representation of the fair value for an instrument. the carryin g value of a long position is adjusted from mid to bid and the carrying value of a short position is adjusted from mid to offer. bid offer valuation adjustments are determined from bid offer prices observed in relevant trading activity and in quotes from other broker dealers or other knowledgeable counterparties. where the quoted price for the instrument is already a bid offer price then no additional bidoffer valuation adjustment is necessary. where the fair value of financial instruments is derived from  a modelling technique then the parameter inputs into that model are normally at a mid market level. such instruments are generally managed on a portfolio basis and when specified criteria are met valuation adjustments are taken to reflect the cost of c losing out the net exposure the bank has to individual market or counterparty risks. these adjustments are determined from bid offer prices observed in relevant trading activity and quotes from other broker dealers.  where complex valuation models are used  or where less liquid positions are being valued then bid offer levels for those positions may not be available directly from the market and therefore for the close out cost of these positions models and parameters must be estimated. when these adjustme nts are designed the group closely examines the valuation risks associated with the model as well as the positions themselves and the resulting adjustments are closely monitored on an ongoing basis.  counterparty credit valuation adjustments cvas are re quired to cover expected credit losses to the extent that the valuation technique does not already include an expected credit loss factor relating to the non performance risk of the counterparty. the cva amount is applied to all relevant over thecounter  otc derivatives and is determined by assessing the potential credit exposure to a given counterparty and taking into account any collateral held the effect of any relevant netting arrangements  expected loss given default and the probability of default  based on available market information including credit default swap cds spreads. where counterparty cds spreads are not available relevant proxies are used.  the fair value of the groups financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss i.e . otc derivative liabilities and issued note liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss incorporates valuation adjustments to measure the change in  the groups own credit risk i.e. debt valuation adjustments dva for derivatives and ow n credit adjustment oca for issued note liabilities. issued note liabilities are discounted utilizing the spread at which similar instruments would be traded a s at the measurement date as this reflects the value from the perspective of a market particip ant who holds the identical item as an asset. the change in this own credit component is reported under other comprehensive income

296,deutsche bank   notes to the cons olidated balance sheet   annual report     financial instruments carried at fair value     for derivative liabilities the group considers its own creditworthiness by assessing all counterparties expected futur e exposure to the group taking into account any collateral posted by the group the effect of relevant netting arrangements the market  price of the groups issued note liabilities the market implied funding costs and the seniority of derivative claims u nder resolution statutory subordination.  when determining cva and dva additional adjustments are made where appropriate to achieve fair value due to the expected loss estimate of a particular arrangement or where the credit risk being assessed differs  in nature to that described by the available cds instrument.  funding valuation adjustments fva are required to incorporate the market implied funding costs into the fair value of derivative positions.  the fva reflects a discounting spread applied to unc ollateralized and partially collateralized derivatives and is determined by assessing the market implied funding costs on both assets and liabilities.   where there is uncertainty in the assumptions used within a modelling technique an additional adjustmen t is taken to calibrate the model price to the expected market price of the financial instrument. typically such transactions have bid offer levels which are less observable and these adjustments aim to estimate the bid offer by computing the liquidity premium associated with the transaction. where a financial instrument is of sufficient complexity that the cost of closing it out would be highe r than the cost of closing out its component risks then an additional adjustment is taken to reflect this.  the g roup uses the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. where relevant these assumptions may include assumptions about climate change. the group has not made material adjustment to fair value for climate change be yond that already priced into market inputs.  valuation control  the group has an independent specialized valuation control group within the risk function which governs and develops the valuation control framework and manages the valuation control processe s. the mandate of this specialist function includes the performance of the independent valuation control process for all businesses the continued development of valuation control methodologies and techniques as well as devising and governing the formal v aluation control policy framework. special attention of this independent valuation control group is directed to areas where management judgment forms part of the valuation process.  results of the valuation control process are collected and analyzed as part  of a standard monthly reporting cycle. variances of differences outside of preset and approved tolerance levels are escalated both within the finance function and with senior  business management for review resolution and if required adjustment.  for in struments where fair value is determined from valuation models the assumptions and techniques used within the models are independently validated by an independent specialist model validation group that is part of the groups risk management function.  quotes for transactions and parameter inputs are obtained from a number of third party sources including exchanges pricing service providers firm broker quotes and consensus pricing services. price sources are examined and assessed to determine the quality of fair value information they represent with greater emphasis given to those possessing greater valuation certainty and relevance. the results are compared against actual transactions in the market to ensure the model valuations are calibrated to market prices.  price and parameter inputs to models assumptions and valuation adjustments are verified against independent sources. where they cannot be verified to independent sources due to lack of observable information the estimate of fair value is subject  to procedures to assess its reasonableness. such procedures include performing revaluation using independently generated models including where existing models are independently recalibrated assessing the valuations against appropriate proxy instrument s and other benchmarks and performing extrapolation techniques. assessment is made as to whether the valuation techniques produce fair value estimates that are reflective of market levels by calibrating the results  of the valuation models against market t ransactions where possible.,0.1836243683527413,,,0.2897779698743956,,0.2860403636073663,0.3627351362659564,0.3096610997193863,0.3214821857850885,,0.4394237959297546,0.2899541376633187,0.3091539003454412,0.3470222236277021,,0.220627126005161,0.1304240692681982,0.1767294679027335,0.27662916636252
297,deutsche bank   notes to the consolidated balance sheet   annual report     financial instruments carried at fair value     valuation techniques  the group has an established valuation control framework which governs internal control standards methodologies valuation techniques and procedures over the valuation process and fair value measurement . the current market conditions including the ongoing macro economic challenges and geopolitical uncertainties required additional focus and review in certain areas during the year  including assessment of bid offer spreads to ensure they are represen tative of fair value.  the following is an explanation of the valuation techniques used in establishing the fair value of the different types of fin ancial instruments that the group trades.  sovereign quasi sovereign and corporate debt and equity securities   where there are no recent transactions then fair value may be determined from the last market price adjusted for all changes in risks and information since that date. where a  close proxy instrument is quoted in an active market then fair value is determ ined by adjusting the proxy value for differences in the risk profile of the instruments. where close proxies are not available then fair value is estimated using more complex  modelling techniques. these techniques include discounted cash flow models using  current market rates for credit interest liquidity and other risks. for equity securities modeling techniques may also include those based on earnings multiples.  mortgage  and other asset backed securities mbsabs  include residential and commercial mbs and other abs including collateralized debt obligations cdo. abs have specific characteristics as they have different underlying assets and the issuing entities have different capital structures. the complexity in creases further where the underlying assets are themselves abs as is the case with many of the cdo instruments.  where no reliable external pricing is available abs are valued where applicable using either relative value analysis which  is performed base d on similar transactions observable in the market or industry standard valuation models making largest possible use of available observable inputs. the industry standard models calculate principal and interest payments for a given deal based on assumptio ns that can be independently price tested. the inputs include prepayment speeds loss assumptions timing and severity and a discount rate spread yield or discount margin. these inputsassumptions are derived from actual transactions external market r esearch and market indices where appropriate.  loans   for certain loans fair value may be determined from the market price on a recently occurring transaction adjusted for all changes in risks and information since that transaction date. where there are no  recent market transactions then broker quotes consensus pricing proxy instruments or discounted cash flow models are used to determine fair value. discounted cash flow models incorporate parameter inputs for credit risk interest rate risk foreign exch ange risk loss given default estimates and amounts utilized given default as appropriate. credit risk loss given default and utilization given default parameters are determined using information from the loan or cds markets where available and appropri ate.  leveraged loans can have transaction specific characteristics which can limit the relevance of market observed transactions. where similar transactions exist for which observable quotes are available from external pricing services then this informati on is used with appropriate adjustments to reflect the transaction differences. when no similar transactions exist a discounted  cash flow valuation technique is used with credit spreads derived from the appropriate leveraged loan index incorporating th e industry classification subordination of the loan and any other relevant information on the loan and loan counterparty.  over thecounter derivative financial instruments   market standard transactions in liquid trading markets such as interest rate swap s foreign exchange forward and option contracts in g currencies and equity swap and option contracts on listed securities or indices are valued using market standard models and quoted parameter inputs. parameter inputs are obtained from pricing services  consensus pricing services and recently occurring transactions in active markets wherever possible.  more complex instruments are modeled using more sophisticated modeling techniques specific for the instrument and are calibrated to available market pric es. where the model output value does not calibrate to a relevant market reference then valuation adjustments are made to the model output value to adjust for any difference. in less active markets data is obtain ed from less frequent market transactions broker quotes and through extrapolation and interpolation techniques. where observable prices or inputs are not available management judgment is required to determine fair values by assessing other relevant sources of information such as

european commission delegated regulation eu  which supplements article   of regulation eu no.  crr requiring institutions to apply the requirements of article    to all assets measured at  fair value and to deduct any additional value adjustments from cet capital. this utilizes an exit price analysis performed for the relevant assets and liabilities in the prudent valu ation

304,deutsche bank   notes to the consolidated balance sheet   annual report     financial instruments carried at fair value     quantitative information about the sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs  the behavior of the unobservable parameters on level   fair value measurement is not necessarily independent and dynamic relationships often exist bet ween the other unobservable parameters and the observable parameters. such relationships where material to the fair value of a given instrument are explicitly captured via correlation parameters or are otherwise controlled via pricing models or valuatio n techniques. frequently where a valuation technique utilizes more than one input the choice of a certain input will bound the range of possible values for other inputs. in addition broader market factors  such as interest rates equity credit or commo dity indices or foreign exchange rates can also have effects.  the range of values shown below represents the highest and lowest inputs used to value the significant exposures within level  . the diversity of financial instruments that make up the disclosu re is significant and therefore the ranges of certain parameters can be large. for example the range of credit spreads on mortgage backed securities represents performing more liquid positions with lower spreads than the less liquid non performing posit ions which will have higher credit spreads. as level   contains the less liquid fair value instruments the wide ranges of parameters seen is to be expected as there is a high degree of pricing differentiation within each exposure type to capture the rele vant market dynamics. the table below provides a brief description of each of the principal parameter types along with a commentary on significant interrelationsh ips between them.  credit parameters are used to assess the creditworthiness of an exposure b y enabling the probability of default and resulting losses of a default to be represented. the credit spread is the primary reflection of creditworthiness and represents the premium or yield return above the benchmark reference instrument typically libor  or relevant treasury instrument depending upon the asset being assessed that a bond holder would require to allow for the credit quality difference between  that entity and the reference benchmark. higher credit spreads will indicate lower credit qualit y and lead to a lower value for a given bond or other loan asset that is to be repaid to the bank by the borrower. recovery rates represent an estimate of the amount a lender would receive in the case of a default of a loan or a bond holder would receiv e in the case of default of the bond. higher recovery rates will give a higher valuation for a given bond position if other parameters are held constant . constant default rate and constant prepayment rate allow more complex loan and debt assets to be asse ssed as these parameters estimate the ongoing defaults arising on scheduled repayments and coupons or whether the borrower is making additional usually voluntary prepayments. these parameters are particularly relevant when forming a fair value opinion for mortgage or other types of lending where repayments are delivered by the borrower through time or where the borrower may prepay the loan seen for example in some residential mortgages. higher constant default rate will lead to lower valuation of a given loan or mortgage as the lender will ultimately receive less cash.  interest rates credit spreads inflation rates foreign exchange rates and equity prices are referenced in some option instruments or other complex derivatives where the payoff a holder of the derivative will receive is dependent upon the behavior of these underlying references through time. volatility parameters describe key attributes of option behavior by enabling the variability of returns of the underlying instrument to be ass essed. this volatility is a measure of probability with higher volatilities denoting higher probabilities of a particular outcome occurring. the underlying references interest rate s credit spreads etc. have an effect on the valuation of options by des cribing the size of the return that can be expected from the option. therefore the value of a given option is dependent upon the value of the underlying instrument and the volatili ty of that instrument representing the size of the payoff and the probab ility of that payoff occurring. where volatilities are high the option holder will see a higher option value as there is greater probability of positive returns. a higher option value w ill also occur where the payoff described by the option is significant .  correlations are used to describe influential relationships between underlying references where a derivative or other instrument has more than one underlying reference. behind some of these relationships for example commodity correlation and interest r ateforeign exchange correlations typically lie macroeconomic factors such as the impact of global demand on groups of commodities or the pricing parity effect of interest rates on foreign exchange rates. more specific relationships can exist between cre dit references or equity stocks in the case of credit derivatives and equity basket derivatives for example. credit correlations are used to estimate the relationship between the credit performance of a range of credit names and stoc k correlations are us ed to estimate the relationship between the returns of a range of equities. a derivative with a correlation exposure will be either long  or short correlation. a high correlation suggests a strong relationship between the underlying references is in force  and this will lead to an increase in value of a long correlation derivative. negative correlations suggest that the relationship between underlying references is opposing i.e. an increase in price of one underlying reference will lead to a reduction in the price of the other.  an ebitda earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization multiple approach can be used in the valuation of less liquid securities. under this approach the enterprise value ev of an entity can be estimated via identifying the ratio of the ev to ebitda of a comparable observable entity and applying this ratio to the ebitda of the entity for which a valuation is being estimated. under this approach a liquidity adjustment is often applied due to the d ifference in liquidity between the generally listed comparable used and the company under

334,deutsche bank   notes to the consolidated balance sheet   annual report     provisions     in determining for which of the claims the possibility of a loss is probable or less than probable but more than remote and  then estimating the possible loss for those claims the group takes into consideration a number of factors inc luding but not limited to the nature of the claim and its underlying facts the procedural posture and litigation history of each case ruli ngs by the courts or tribunals the groups experience and the experience of others in similar cases to the extent this is known to the group prior settlement discussions settlements by others in similar cases to the extent this is known to the group avai lable indemnities and the opinions and views of legal counsel and other experts.  the provisions the group has  recognized for civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters as of december   and december   are set forth in the table above. for some matters when the group believes an outflow of funds is probable  but the group could not reliably e stimate the amount of the potential outflow no provision was recognized.  for the matters for which a reliable estimate can be made but the probability of a future loss or outflow of resources is mo re than remote but less than probable the group currentl y estimates that as of december   these contingent liabilities are approximately  . billion  for civil litigation matters december     . billion  and  . billion  for regulatory enforcement matters december     . billion . these figures include matters where the groups potential liability is joint and several and where the group expects any such liability to be paid by a third party. if the groups best estimate is  within  a range the amount at the top of the range is disclosed for contingent liabilities.  for other significant civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters where the group believes the possibility of an outf low of funds is more than remote but less th an probable but the amount is not reliably estimable such matters are not included in the contingent liability estimates. in addition where the group believes the possibility of an outflow of funds is remote  the group has neither recognized a provision  nor included the matters in the contingent liability estimates.  this estimated possible loss as well as any provisions taken is based upon currently available information and is subject t o significant judgment and a variety of assumptions variables an d known and unknown uncertainties. these uncertainties may include inaccuracies in or incompleteness of the information available to the group particularly at the preliminary stages o f matters and assumptions by the group as to future rulings of courts o r other tribunals or the likely actions or positions taken by regulators or adversaries may prove incorrect. moreover estimates of possible loss for these matters are often not amenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative analytical tools freq uently used in making judgments and estimates and are subject to even greater degrees of uncertainty than in many other areas where the group must exercise judgment and make estimates. the estimated possible loss as well as any provisions taken can be a nd often are substantially less than the amount initially requested by regulators or adversaries or the maximum potential loss that could be incurred were th e matters to result in a final adjudication adverse to the group. moreover in several regions in w hich the group operates an adversary often is not required to set forth the amount it is seeking and where it is the amount may not be subject to the same requirements that generally apply to pleading factual allegations or legal claims.  the matters for  which the group determines that the possibility of a future loss is more than remote will change from time to time as will the matters as to which a reliable estimate can be made and the estimated possible loss for such matters. actua l results may prove to be significantly higher or lower than the estimate of possible loss in those matters where such an estimate was made. in addition loss may be incurred in matters with respect to which the group believed the likelihood of loss was remote. in particular  the estimated aggregate possible loss does not represent the groups potential maximum loss exposure for those matters.  the group may settle litigation or regulatory proceedings or investigations prior to a final judgment or determination of lia bility. it may do so to avoid the cost management efforts or negative business regulatory or reputational consequences of continuing  to contest liability even when the group believes it has valid defenses to liability. it may also do so when the potential conseq uences of failing to prevail would be disproportionate to the costs of settlement. furthermore the group may for similar reasons reimburse counterparties for their losses even in situations where it does not believe that it is legally compelled to do so. current individual proceedings  set forth below are descriptions of civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters or groups of matters for which the gr oup has taken material provisions or for which there are material contingent liabilities that ar e more than remote or for which there is the possibility of material business or reputational risk as well as other significant matters similar matters are group ed together and some matters consist of a number of proceedings or claims. the disclosed mat ters also include matters for which the possibility of a loss is more than remote but for which the group cannot reliably estimate the possible loss. matters

postbank shares prior to its  voluntary takeover may impact two pending appraisal proceedings  spruchverfahren . these proceedings were initiated by former postbank shareholders w ith the aim to increase the cash compensation offered in connection with the squeeze out of postbank shareholders in   and the cash compensation offered and annual compensation paid in connection with the execution of a domination and profit and loss tr ansfer agreement  beherrschungs  und gewinnabführungs vertrag  between db finanz holding ag now db beteiligungs holding gmbh and postbank in  .  the applicants in the appraisal proceedings claim that a potential obligation of deutsche bank to make a m andatory takeover offer for postbank at an offer price of  .  should be decisive when determining the adequate cash compensation in the appraisal proceedings. the regional cou rt cologne had originally followed this legal view of the applicants in two resolutions. in a decision dated june   the regional court cologne expressly gave up this legal view in the appraisal proceedings in connection with the execution of a dominati on and profit and loss transfer agreement. according to this decision the question whether deutsche bank was obliged to make a mandatory offer for all postbank shares prior to its voluntary takeover offer in  shall not be relevant for determining the appropriate cash compensation. it is likely that the regional court cologne will take the same legal position in the appraisal proceedings in connection with the squeeze out. on october    the regional court cologne handed down a decision in the appr aisal proceeding concerning the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement dated december    according to which the annual compensation pursuant to section   of the german stock corporation act  jährliche ausgleichszahlung  shall be increas ed by  . to  . per postbank share and the settlement amount pursuant to section  of the ger man stock corporation act  abfindungsbetrag  shall be increased by  . to  .  per postbank shar e. the increase of the settlement amount is of relevance for approximately   former postbank shares whereas the increase of the annual compensation is of relevance for appro ximately  million  former postbank shares. deutsche bank as well as the applicants have lodged an appeal against this decision.  the group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to this matter becaus e it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously its outcome.  ruschemalliance litigation.  in june   ruschemalliance llc rca a russian joint venture of gazprom pjsc and rusgasdobycha jsc filed a claim against deutsche bank before a commercial state court in saint petersburg. a court hearing took place on october  . a further hearing on the merits has been scheduled for april  . rca is seeking payment of approximately   million  excluding interest under an advance payment guarantee apg issued by deutsch e bank in  at the request of one of its clients with rca named as beneficiary.  rca made a payment demand under the apg which was rejected by deutsche bank due to the imposition of eu sanctions against russia. the russian court has accepted this claim and assumed jurisdiction contrary to the contractual arrangements in the apg which provide for arbitration in paris. it can thus be assumed that the russian court will also not recognize the applicability of the eu sanctions. deutsche bank maintains assets  in russia which could be seized if the claim would be granted and enforced. deutsche bank is entitled to indemnification from its client with respect to the banks payment obligations under the advance payment guarantee and the legal fees and costs relate d to the court proceedings and the enforcement of a negative court decision. deutsche bank has recognized a provision in the amount of approx imately    million  and a correspond ing reimbursement asset under the indemnification agreement. the expense from the recognition of the provision is offset by the income from the recognition of the reimbursement asset.  sovereign supranational and agency bonds ssa investigations and litig ations . deutsche bank has received inquiries from certain regulatory and law enforcement authorities including requests for information and documents pertaining to ssa bond trading. deutsche bank is cooperating with these investigations.  on may    the uk competition and markets authority cma sent a statement of objections to deutsche bank regarding a potential breach of united kingdom antitrust rules in relation to the sale secondary market trading and buy back auctions of united kingdom governm ent bonds which includes gilts and gilt asset swaps  between  and . deutsche bank proactively cooperated with the cma in this matter and as a result has been granted full provisional immunity. the sending of  a statement of objections is a step in the cmas investigation and does not prejudge the outcome of the investigation which is ongoing.  on november   the european commission announced its decision that deutsche bank and one other bank in the past breached eu antitrust rules in relation  to secondary market trading of euro denominated ssa bonds and to a very limited extent government guaranteed bonds. deutsche bank has proactively cooperated with the european commission in this matter and as a result has been granted full immunity. in accordance with the european commissions guidelines no financial penalty was imposed on deutsche bank. the timeframe of the alleged infringement ended in .,,,,,,,,0.2901641913276003,,,,,,,0.2443328809677055,,,,

355,deutsche bank   additional notes   annual report     employee benefits     multi employer plans  in germany the group is a member of the bvv versicherungsverein des bankgewerbes a.g. bvv together with other financial institutions. the bvv offers retirement benefits to eligible employees in germany as a complement to post employment benefit promises  of the group. both employers and employees contribute on a regular basis to the bvv. the bvv provides annuities of a fixed amount to individuals on retirement and increases these fixed amounts if surplus assets arise within the plan. according to legislat ion in germany the employer is ultimately liable for providing the benefits to its employees. an increase in benefits may also arise due to additional obligations to retirees for the effects of inflation. bvv  is a multi employer defined benefit plan. howe ver in line with industry practice the group accounts for it as a defined contribution plan since insufficient information is available to identify assets and liabilities relating to the groups current and forme r employees primarily because the bvv doe s not fully allocate plan assets to beneficiaries nor to member companies.  governance and risk  the group maintains a pensions committee to oversee its pension and related risks on a global basis. this committee meets at least quarterly and reports directl y to the senior executive compensation committee.  within this context the group develops and maintains guidelines for governance and risk management including funding asset allocation and actuarial assumption setting.  during and after acquisitions or c hanges in the external environment e.g. legislation taxation topics such as the general plan design or potential plan amendments are considered. any plan changes follow a process requiring approval by group human resources and above a certain thresho ld also of the pensions committee.  pension risk management is embedded in the groups risk management organization with strong focus on market risks given importance of capital market developments e.g. interest rate credit spread price inflation fo r the value of plan assets and liabilities hence ifrs and regulatory capital. risk management thereby encompasses regular measurement monitoring and reporting of risks via specific metrics as well as a risk control framework e.g. via the establishment of risk limits or thresholds as applicable. risk management activities also include the consideration review and measurement of other financial risks e.g. risks from demographic and other actuarial assumptions e.g. longevity risk but also the assessme nt of model valuation and other non financial risks.  in the groups key pension countries the groups largest post employment benefit plan risk exposures relate to potential changes in credit spreads interest rates price inflation and longevity that a re partially mitigated through the investment strategy adopted. to the extent that pension plans are funded the assets held mitigate some of the liability risks but intr oduce investment risk.  overall the group seeks to minimize the impact of pensions on  the groups financial position from market movements subject to balancing the trade offs involved in financing post employment benefits regulatory capital and constraints from local funding or accounting requirements.  funding  the group maintains variou s external pension trusts to fund the majority of its defined benefit plan obligations. the groups funding principle is to maintain funding of the defined benefit obligation by plan assets within a range of  to  of the obligation subject to meeting any local statutory requirements. the group has also determined that certain plans should remain unf unded although their funding approach is subject to periodic review e.g. when local regulations or practices change. obligations for the groups unfunded plans are accrued on the balance sheet.  for many of the externally funded defined benefit plans ther e are local minimum funding requirements. the group can decide on any additional plan contributions with reference to the groups funding principle. there are some locations e.g. the uni ted kingdom where the trustees and the group jointly agree contribu tion levels. in most countries the group expects to receive an economic benefit from any plan surpluses of plan assets compared to defined benefit obligations typically by way of reduced future contributions. given the relatively high funding level and th e investment strategy adopted in the groups key funded defined benefit plans any minimum funding requirements that may apply are not expected to place the group under any material adverse cash strain in the short term. with reference to the groups fundi ng principle the group considers not reclaiming benefits paid from the groups assets as an equivalent to making cash contributions into the external pension trusts during the year.,,,,,,,,,,,0.4336359030913785,,,,0.2600800255326303,,0.1710745960930352,,

359,deutsche bank   addition al notes   annual report     employee benefits     investment strategy  the groups investment objective is to protect the group from adverse impacts of its defined benefit pension p lans on key financial metrics. the primary focus is to protect the plans ifrs funded status in the case of adverse market scenarios. sin ce  there has been a shift in the investment strategy in selected markets to balance competing key financial metri cs. investment managers manage pension assets in line with investment mandates or guidelines as agreed with the pension plans trustees and investment committees.  for key defined benefit plans for which the group aims to protect the ifrs funded status the  group applies a liability driven investment approach. risks from mismatches between fluctuations in the present value of the defined benefit obligations and plan assets due to capital market movements are minimized subject to balancing relevant trade offs. this is achieved by allocating plan assets closely to the market risk factor exposures of the pension liability to interest rates credit spreads  and inflation. thereby plan assets broadly reflect the underlying risk profile and currency of the pension  obligations.  where the desired hedging level for market risks cannot be achieved with physical instruments i.e. corporate and government  bonds derivatives are employed. derivative overlays mainly include interest rate inflation swaps and credit defa ult swaps. other instruments are also used such as interest rate futures and options. in practice a completely hedged approach is impractical for instance because of insufficient market depth for ultra longterm corporate bonds as well as liquidity and  cost considerations. therefore plan assets contain further return seeking asset categories such as equity real estate high yield bonds or emerging markets bonds to create long term value and achieve diversification benefits. furthermore this shift in the investment strategy allows for actively taken market risk exposures from interest rates and credit spreads within defined lim its governed by the pensions committee. as a result the market risk from plan assets has been reduced.  in  the group ente red into a buy in transaction with a third party insurer to de risk   million  of exposure to the uk defined benefit pension schemes funded from existing assets with no additi onal employer contribution required. the recognition of the insurance policy as a qualifying plan asset negatively impacted other comprehensive income in the groups financial statement by approximately   million . a similar buy in transaction to de risk   million  of exposure occurred in  which negatively impacted other comprehensive income in the groups financial statement by approximately   million . in total the group has entere d into four buy in transactions in the uk with third party insurers protecting the group from movements in defined benefit obligations of around  . billion  as at  december  .  plan asset allocation to key asset classes  the following table shows the asset allocation of the groups funded defined benefit plans to key asset classes i.e. exposur es include physical securities in discretely managed portfolios and underlying ass et allocations of any commingled funds used to invest plan assets.  asset amounts in the following table include both quoted i.e. level   assets in accordance with ifrs    amounts invested in markets where the fair value can be determined directly fr om prices which are quoted in active liquid markets and other i.e. level   and  assets in accordance with ifrs   assets.,,,,,,,,,,,0.488823609681977,,,,,,0.1447790302679803,,

362,deutsche bank   additional notes   annual report     employee benefi ts    key risk sensitivities  the groups defined benefit obligations are sensitive to changes in capital market conditions and actuarial assumptions. sensitivities to capital market movements and key assumption changes are presented in the following table. each market risk factor or assumption is changed in isolation. sensitivities of the defined benefit obligations are approximated using geometr ic extrapolation methods based on plan durations for the respective assumption. duration is a risk measure that indicates the broad sensitivity of the obligations to a change in an underlying assumption and provides a reasonable approximation for smal l to moderat e changes in those assumptions.  for example the interest rate duration is derived from the change in the defined benefit obligation to a change in the inter est rate based on information provided by the local actuaries of the respective plans. the resultin g duration is used to estimate the remeasurement liability loss or gain from changes in the interest rate. for other assumptions a similar approach is used  to derive the respective sensitivity results.  for defined benefit pension plans changes in capital  market conditions will impact the plan obligations via actuarial assumptions e.g. via the discount rate and price inflation rate as well as the plan assets fair value. where the group app lies a liability driven investment approach or has insured part o f the obligations as in the uk the groups overall risk exposure to such changes is reduced. to help readers gain a better understanding of the groups risk exposures to key capital market movements the net impact of the change in the defined benefit obl igations and plan assets due to a change of the related market risk factor or underlying actuarial assumption is shown. where changes in actuarial assumptions do not affect plan assets only the impact on the defined benefit obligations is reported.  asset related sensitivities are derived for the groups major plans by using risk sensitivity factors determined by the groups market risk management function. these sensitivities are calculated based on information provided by the plans investment managers a nd extrapolated linearly to reflect the approximate change of the plan assets market value in case of a change in the underlying risk factor.  the sensitivities illustrate plausible variations over time in capital market movements and key actuarial assumpt ions. the group is not in a position to provide a view on the likelihood of these capital market or assumption changes. while these sensitivities illustrate the overall impact on the funded status of the changes shown the significance of the impact and th e range of reasonable possible alternative assumptions may differ between the different plans that comprise the aggregated results. even though plan assets and plan obligations are sensitive to similar risk factors actual changes in plan assets an d obliga tions may not fully offset each other due to imperfect correlations between market risk factors and actuarial assumptions. caution should be used when extrapolating these sensitivities due to non linear effects that changes in capital market conditions and  key actuarial assumptions may have on the overall funded status. any management actions that may be taken to mitigate the inherent risks in the post employment defined benefit plans are not reflected in these sensitivities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.2189006018847279,0.1416767855776404,,

375,deutsche bank   additional notes   annual report     structured entities       structured entities  nature purpose and extent of the groups interests in structured entities  the group engages in various business activities with structured entities which are designed to achieve a specific business purpose. a structured entity is one that has been set up so that any voting rights or similar rights are not the dominant fac tor in deciding who controls the ent ity. an example is when voting rights relate only to administrative tasks and the relevant activities are directed by contractual arrangements.  a structured entity often has some or all of the following features or attributes   restricted activities   a narro w and well defined objective   insufficient equity to permit the structured entity to finance its activities without subordinated financial support   financing in the form of multiple contractually linked instruments to investors that create concentrations of credit or other risks tranches  the principal uses of structured entities are to provide clients with access to specific portfolios of assets and to provide market liquidity for clients through securitizing financial assets. structured entities may be est ablished as corporations trusts or partnerships. structured entities generally finance the purchase of assets by issuing debt and equity securities that are collateralized by andor indexed to the assets held by the structured entities. the debt and equit y securities issued by structured entities may include tranches with varying levels of subordination.  structured entities are consolidated when the substance of the relationship between the group and the structured entities indicate that the structured ent ities are controlled by the group as discussed in note   material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates.  consolidated structured entities  the group has contractual arrangements which may require it to provide financial support to the fo llowing types of consolidated structured entities.  securitization vehicles  the group uses securitization vehicles for funding purchase of diversified pool of assets. the group provides financial suppo rt to these entities in the form of liquidity facility.  as of december    and december    there were no outstanding loan commitments to these entities.  funds  the group may provide funding and liquidity facility or guarantees to funds consolidated by the group. as of december    and decembe r   the notional value of the liquidity facilities and guarantees provided by the group to such funds was  . billion  and  . billion  respectively.  deutsche bank did not provide non contractual support during the year to consolidated structured entities.  unconsolidated structured entities  these are entities which are not consolidated because t he group does not control them through voting rights contract funding agreements or other means. the extent of the groups interests to unconsolidated structured entities will vary depending on the type of structured entities.  below is a description of the groups involvements in unconsolidated structured entities by type.  repackaging and investment entities  repackaging and investment entities are established to meet clients investment needs through the combination of securities and derivatives. these e ntities are not consolidated by the group because the group does not have power to influence the returns obtained from the entities. these entities are usually set up to provide a certain investment return pre agreed with the investor and the group is not  able to change the investment strategy or return during the life of the transaction.,,,,0.3175765878522097,0.2844534365950614,0.2879669507004141,0.3834174557024991,0.314916721600439,0.2553021608822134,0.2990231094973036,0.4930645693125057,0.2862935671083322,0.2833791574848256,0.3512061391018917,0.2728576480921312,0.2479822101059134,0.1465187117252061,0.1638692898665646,0.304774138414891
376,deutsche bank   additional notes   annual report     structured entities     third party funding entities  the group provides funding to structured entities that hold a variety of assets. these entities may take the form of funding entities trusts  and private investment companies. the funding is collateralized by the asset in the structured entities. the groups involvement involves predominantly both lending and loan commitments.  the vehicles used in these transactions are controlled by the borrow ers where the borrowers have the ability to decide whether to post additional margin or collateral in respect of the financing. in such cases where borrowers can decide to continue or  terminate the financing the borrowers will consolidate the vehicle.  securitization vehicles  the group establishes securitization vehicles which purchase diversified pools of assets including fixed income securities corporate loans and asset backed securities predominantly commercial and residential mortgage backed securities and credit card r eceivables. the vehicles fund these purchases by issuing multiple tranches of debt and equity securities the repayment of which is linked to the performance of the assets in the vehicles.  the group may transfer assets to these securitization vehicles an d provides financial support to these entities in the form of liquidity facilities. the group also invests and provides liquidity facilities to third party sponsored securitization vehicl es. the securitization vehicles that are not consolidated into the gr oup are those where the group does not hold the power or ability to unilaterally remove the servicer or special servicer who has been delegated power over the activities of the entity.  funds  the group establishes structured entities to accommodate client requirements to hold investments in specific assets. the group also invests in funds that are sponsored by third parties or the bank may act as fund manager custodian or some other capacity and provide funding and liquidity facilities t o both bank sponsored and third party funds. the funding provided is collateralized by the underlying assets held by the fund.  the group does not consolidate funds when deutsche bank is deemed agent or when another third party investor has the ability to d irect the activities of the fund.  other  these are deutsche bank sponsored or third party structured entities that do not fall into any criteria above. these entities  are not consolidated by the group when the bank does not hold power over the decision maki ng of these entities.  income derived from involvement with structured entities  the group earns management fees and occasionally performance based fees for its investment management service in relation to funds. interest income is recognized on the fundin g provided to structured entities. any trading revenue as a result of derivatives with structured entities and from the movements in the value of notes held in these entities is recognized in net gainslosses on financial assetsliabilities held at fair v alue through profit and loss.  interests in unconsolidated structured entities  the groups interests in unconsolidated structured entities refer to contractual and non contractual involvement that exposes the bank to variability of returns from the performa nce of the structured entities. examples of interests in unconsolidated structured entities include debt or equity investments liquidity facilities guarantees and certain derivative instruments i n which the group is absorbing variability of returns from the structured entities.  interests in unconsolidated structured entities exclude instruments which introduce variability of returns into the structure d entities. for example when the bank purchases credit protection from an unconsolidated structured entit y whose purpose and design is to pass through credit risk to investors the bank is providing the variability of returns to the entity rather tha n absorbing variability. the purchased credit protection is therefore not considered as an interest for the pur pose of the table below.  maximum exposure to unconsolidated structured entities  the maximum exposure to loss is determined by considering the nature of the interest in the unconsolidated structured entity.  the maximum exposure for loans and trading instrum ents is reflected by their carrying amounts in the consolidated balance sheet. the maximum exposure for derivatives and off balance sheet commitments such as guarantees liquidity facilities and loan commitments under ifrs   as interpreted by deutsche ba nk is reflected by the notional amounts. such amounts or its development do not reflect the economic risks faced by the group because it does not take into account the effects of collateral or hedges nor the probability of such losses being incurred. at december    the notional related to the positive and negative replacement values of derivatives and off balance sheet commitments were   billion    billion  and   billion  respectively. at december    the notional related to the positive and negative replace ment values of derivatives and off balance sheet commitments were   billion    billion  and   billion  respectively.,0.1955440960716955,0.2504029107575739,0.2433069699737308,0.3375865702033613,0.3180859555573682,0.3047443287520986,0.3970514357498357,0.3519766990382441,0.2983119399147549,0.2961035538260603,0.5424103228391784,0.328655627321078,0.3165245319017384,0.3886188039312948,0.2821078307175191,0.2450217280590201,0.1822398495024534,0.1904401656167012,0.3412835720737284

443,deutsche bank   compensation of the management board   annual report   application of the compensation system in the financial year     compliance with the set maximum compensation cap  the maximum compensation limit cap is set at   million  for each man agement board member. this is based on the actual expense andor actual disbursement of the compensation awarded for a financial year. the base salaries are fixed amounts. the expenses for fringe benefits vary from management board member to management boa rd member in any given year. the contribution to deutsche banks pension plan or pension allowance is set at the same amount for all management board members. however the amount to be recognized by the bank during the year for deutsche banks pension serv ice costs fluctuates based on actuarial variables. as the expense amount for the multi year variable compensation components of the short term award sta and long term award lta are not determined until up to seven years due to the deferral periods compliance with the maximum compensation set for the  financial year can only be conclusively reported within the framework of the compensation reports for the financial years up to . compliance with the maximum compensation limit as defined under sec tion a of the german stock corporation act is however already ensured for the  financial year.  deferrals and holding periods  the remuneration ordinance for institutions institutsvergv generally stipulates a three year assessment period for the determination of the variable compensation for management board members. deutsche bank complies with this requirement by assessing each of the objectives of the long term award lta over a three year period. if the relevant three years cannot be attribute d to a member of the management board because the member joined the bank only recently the achievement level for the objectives will be determined for the period that can be attributed to the member. the deferral period for the lta is in principle five ye ars. if the assessment period is shorter than the prescribed minimum the deferral period of the variable compensation to be granted is extended by the number of years missing for the minimum assessment period. the short term award sta has an assessment period of one year. the deferral period for the sta is in principle seven years.  the long term award lta is granted in the form of share based instruments restricted equity awards reas. the reas vest over a deferral period of  years in  tranches b eginning with a tranche of  in year  and three tranches of  each in year   and  following the grant of the variable compensation grant date. subsequent to the grant date the reas of each tranche are subject to an additional holding period of  one year. accordingly the management board members cannot dispose of the shares underlying the reas until after  years at the earliest and in full until after  years following the  grant date. during the deferral and holding periods the value of the reas is linked to the performance of the deutsche bank share and is therefore tied to the long term performance of the bank and thereby strengthens the alignment of the management board members incentives to deutsche banks performance.  the short term a ward sta is generally granted in the form of deferred cash compensation restricted incentive awards  rias. the sta is paid out in four tranches of  each over a total period of seven years in year    and  following th e grant date. however if the sta accounts for more than  of the total variable compensation the portion exceeding  is also granted in the form of restricted equity awards reas. this ensures that at least  of the total variable compensatio n is always granted in a share based form in accordance with the regulatory requirements. the portion exceeding  is subject to the same deferral rules as the share based compensation from the lta.  instead of receiving restricted equity awards reas and restricted incentive awards r ias as described above holders of specific functions at certain deutsche bank u.s. entities are required by applicable regulation to be compensated under different plans. restricted compensation for these persons consists of restricted share awards and r estricted cash awards. the recipient becomes the beneficial owner of the awards as of the award date and the awards are held on the recipients behalf. these awards are restricted for a period of time subject to the applicable plan rules and award stateme nts including performance conditions and forfeiture provisions. the restriction period is aligned to the retention periods applicable to deutsche banks usual deferred awards. with regard to the management board members these rules apply to stefan simon  due to his role as ceo of deutsche bank usa corp.  if a member of the management board is identified as senior management function smf holder by the prudential regulation authority pra in the uk specific deferral provisions under uk regulation in p rinciple apply. fabrizio campelli was identified as smf holder for  variable compensation purposes due to his oversight responsibility for the uk region. in  it was agreed with the pra that the proportion of the variable compensation which corres ponds to the time spent for this regional oversight responsibility is subject to the deferral provisions under uk regulation. therefore  of his varia ble compensation is deferred in line with the uk regulation i.e.  is granted in restricted incentive  awards rias and paid out in two equal tranches in year  and  following the grant date and  is granted in restricted equity awards reas and vests  in  equal tranches in year     and  following the grant date. after the vesting each tranche  is subject to an additional holding period of one year.,,,,,,0.2728842615908358,,,0.2356552740685364,,,,,,0.2762774646876184,0.2720496202254445,,,

452,deutsche bank   compensation of the management board   annual report   outlook for the  financial year     outlook for the  financial year  the current management board compensation system was approved by the general meeting in . since then it has been proven that the system works well and sets the right incentives. at the same time the compensation system is competitive. nevertheless the supervisory board and in preparation the compensation control committee of deutsche bank regularly review the compensation system of the management board members with regard to market trends and i nvestor feedback. furthermore the regulatory requirements of the stock corporation act aktg the remuneration ordinance for institutions institutsvergv as well as the principles and recommendations of the german corporate governance code gcgc as mo st recently amended are taken into account.  as part of the review process in  points of improvement were identified which are explained below. these improvements are reflected in a new compensation system that will be submitted for approval to the g eneral meeting in may  with effect from the beginning of  onwards.  forward looking assessment period for the long term incentive lti   in the previous compensation system the collective objectives of the long term incentive were assessed over a p eriod of three years. thereby the current financial year was weighted at . the two previous years were weighted at  and  respectively. to reflect the feedback of shareholders a forward looking assessment period will be used instead for the performance measurement of the future lti. furthermore in contrast to the previous compensation system which stipulated different weightings for each financial year the target achievement will be determined after three financial years. as a res ult the super visory board will set objectives and their target values for three years in the future. this fosters a long term focus and thus the sustainable development of the company.  reduction of complexity  the supervisory board has identified two changes to signifi cantly reduce the overall complexity of the compensation system and thus increase transparency in the compensation report   the complexity of variable compensation has been simplified by reducing the number of objectives. in the short term incentive sti a maximum of five objectives for measuring individual and divisional performance will be set in future instead of the previous three to four individual objectives plus an additional behavior objective and a complex balanced scorecard with a large number o f key performance indicators. the future sti objectives can be categorized into financial esg and personal always ensuring a balance of financial and non financial quantitative and qualitative objective s. the lti provides for a lower number of ob jectives compared to the previous system. the objectives of the lti are reflected by group financials return on tangible equity rote and total book value per share tbvps relative total shareholder return rtsr and esg objectives.   total variable compensation will continue to be granted predominantly in deferred form to ensure the sustainability of earnings within the framework of the business and risk strategies. furthermore total variable compensation will continue to be granted predomi nantly as equity based instruments to achieve an even stronger alignment of the management board members compensation to the banks performance and its share price. in the previous compensation system the underlying scheme for deferral and holding period s was perceived as complex. in the future half of the sti will be paid out directly after the one year assessment period in cash and the other half is granted equity based with an additional holding period of one year. the lti will be paid out in equity starting one year after the three year assessment period and distributed over five equal consecutive installments each with an additional holding period of one year. in total the full  lti pay out amount of a tranche will be available for disposal after  nine years. the supervisory board is confident that the new scheme for deferral and holding periods is significantly simpler and more comprehensible while at the same time fulfilling the regulatory requirements of the institutsvergv.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.2228336031485486,,,
453,deutsche bank   compensation of the management board   annual report   outlook for the  financial year     increase of pay forperformance alignment  several shareholders expressed concerns regarding the design of the previous target achievement curve for the relative total shareholder return rtsr in the long term component which measures the tsr of the deutsche bank share in relation to the average tsr of a selected peer group. in particular shareholders criticized that payout starts at a tsr of   below the peer group and an equal performance with the peer group results in a target achievement of . in line with the mark et practices of international banks and to further strengthen the pay forperformance alignment of deutsche banks compensation the target achievement for the rtsr will be assessed based on deutsche banks percentile rank compared to the individual compan ies in the peer group. according to the new method the payout starts if the percentile rank of deutsche bank is at the median i.e. deutsche bank must outperform  of the companies in the peer group. a target achievement of  is defined as reaching the th percentile which in the current peer group of ten international banks corresponds to achieving rank  in terms of tsr performance. only ranks  and  allow a payout at the upper threshold of  target achievement. the supervisory board would like to point out that the ambition level of the new target achievement curve goes beyond the current practice in the german market and shows that shareholders feedback has been heard and implemented.  increase in market alignment  to increase market align ment and harmonize further contractual agreements of the management board compensation changes have been made in the pension scheme shareholding guidelines and termination benefits.   with regard to the former pension scheme a simple cash allowance model  will be introduced for newly appointed members of the management board. the cash allowance is paid out directly in a lump sum. this avoids interest rate and biometric risks in financing a pension entitlement as well as the administrative procedures associ ated with this for the deutsche bank. in addition the annual pension allowance for a newly ordinary management board member will be  lower than the pension contribution currently granted.   furthermore in line with current market practice a build up ph ase of four years will be introduced for the obligation under shareholding guidelines.   in line with german market practice as well as recommendation g. german corporate governance code gcgc severance payments are currently limited to two times the an nual total compensation and are not paid beyond the remaining term of the service contract severance cap. considering feedback from investors and other stakeholders  the supervisory board will reduce the severance cap at a maximum of two years base sala ry for newly appointed members of the management board . in addition the waiting allowance karenzentschädigung for the duration of the subsequent non competition period will be lowered from  of the annual base salary to  of the annual base salary.  outlook on the objectives of the variable compensation    the new compensation system establishes a strong alignment of interests between the management board members and shareholders of deutsche bank and allows for a high degree of transparency fo r stakeholders. against this background the supervisory board made a commitment to disclose the long term objectives and target values of the variable compensation  which is based on the new compensation system before the start of the respective ass essment period. short term individual targets will continue to be disclosed retrospectively.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.2267280204423468,,,
