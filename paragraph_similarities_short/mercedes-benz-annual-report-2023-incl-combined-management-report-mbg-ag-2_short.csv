financial statements  further i nformation        notes to the consolidated  financial   statements    the mercedes benz group as lessor equipment on operating  leases  based on the risks and rewards associated with a leased asset it is assessed whether economic ownership of the leased asset is transferred to the lessee finance  leases or remains with the lessor operating  leases.  for operating  leases  the economic ownership of the vehicle remains at the mercedes benz group. additionally an operating  lease may have to be reported with sales of vehicles for which the group enters into a repurchase obligation.   sales of vehicles by which the mercedes benz group is obliged to repurchase the vehicles in the future are accounted for as operating  leases. this also applies to a call option that only grants the mercedes benz group the right to repurchase.   sales of vehicles including a put option an entitys obligation to repurchase the asset at the customers request are reported as operating  leases if the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise that right. otherwise a sale with a right of return is reported. the mercedes benz group considers several factors when assessing whether a customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise his or her right at contract inception. among others these are the relation between  the repurchase price and the expected future market value at the time of repurchase of the asset  or historical return rates.  as part of the residual value management process especially for operating  lease contracts certain assumptions are regularly made regarding the expected level of prices based upon which the cars to be returned in the leasing business are evaluated. if changing market developments at the balance sheet date lead to a negative deviation from previously estimated assumptions the residual value must be adjusted or an impairment carried out. depending on the region and the current market situation the risk mitigation measures taken generally include continuous market monitoring as well as if required price setting strategies or sales promotion measures designed to regulate vehicle inventories. market forecasts are verified by regular comparisons of internal and external sources and if required the determination of residual values is adjusted and further developed with regard to methods processes and systems.  in the case of accounting as an operating  lease these vehicles are capitalized at the amortized cost of production under equipment  on operating leases  and are depreciated over the contract term on a straight line basis with consideration of the expected residual values. changes in the expected residual values lead either to prospective adjustments of the scheduled depreciation or if necessary to an impairment loss. the vehicles are allocated to the segment which bears substantially all of the residual value risk.  operating  leases also relate to vehicles primarily group products that mercedes benz mobility acquires from non group dealers or other third parties and leases to end customers. these vehicles are presented at amortized cost of acquisition under equipment on operating leases  in the mercedes benz mobility segment. if these vehicles are group products and are subsidized and these subsidies are passed on in the lease agreement with the external customer the subsidies are deducted from the acquisition cost. after revenue is received from the sale to independent dealers these group products generate revenue from lease payments and subsequent resale on the basis of the separate leasing contracts.  in the case of finance  leases  the group presents the receivables under receivables from financial services in an amount corresponding to the net investment of the lease agreements. the net investment of a lease agreement is the gross investment future lease payments and non guaranteed residual value discounted at the rate upon which the lease agreement is based. mercedes benz mobility continues the leasing and sales financing business for daimler trucks commercial vehicles in some markets. to this end mercedesbenz mobility acquires these vehicles from daimler truck and leases them to the end customers. insofar as a mandatory vehicle return to daimler truck has been agreed a leasing contract head lease between

contracts and thus treated as suspended transactions although they fulfil the definition of a derivative. if such contracts do not meet the criteria for executory contracts they are recorded as derivatives. these derivatives are measured at fair value through profit or loss. the valuation effects are reported in the functional costs in which the consumption of the procured non financial items e.g. energy is reported.  embedded derivatives are principally separated from the host contract and recognized separately. however embedded derivatives are not separated from the host contract if that host contract is a financial asset if the mercedes benz group chooses to measure a hybrid contract at fair value through profit or loss or if the embedded derivative is closely related to the host contract.  derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value upon initial recognition and at each subsequent reporting date. the fair value of listed derivatives is equal to their positive or negative market value. if a market value is not available fair value is calculated using standard financial valuation models such as discounted cash flow or option pricing models. derivatives are recognized as assets if their fair value is positive and as liabilities if their fair value is negative.  if the requirements for hedge accounting set out in ifrs  are met the mercedes benz group designates and documents the hedge relationship from the date a derivative contract is entered into as a fair value hedge a cash  flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign business operation. in a fair value hedge the changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment are hedged. in a cash  flow hedge highly probable future cash flows from expected transactions or variable cash flows to be paid or received related to a recognized asset or liability are hedged. the documentation of the hedging relationship includes the objectives and strategy of risk management the type of hedging relationship the nature of the risk being hedged the identification of the eligible hedging instrument and the eligible hedged item as well as an assessment of the effectiveness requirements comprising the risk mitigating economic relationship the absence of deteriorating effects from credit risk and the appropriate hedge ratio. the effectiveness of the hedge is assessed at the start of and during the hedging relationship.  changes in fair value of non designated derivatives are recognized in profit or loss. for fair value hedges changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and the hedged item are recognized in profit or loss. for cash  flow hedges fair value changes in the effective portion of derivative financial instruments are recognized after tax in other comprehensive income.  effects from hedging are presented in the item of the statement of income in which the underlying transaction is
