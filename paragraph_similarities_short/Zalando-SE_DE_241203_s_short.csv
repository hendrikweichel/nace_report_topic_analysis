statements.zalando assessed possible impacts of the new ifrs as well as related amendments to other applicable ifrs on our financial statements at initial application. ifrs  introduces a new fivecategory classification system that will affect our consolidated income statement. the standard first defines the operating category that will include all items of income or expense that are not classified in one of the other four categories. the majority of items currently included in our ebit will be allocated to this operating category. the investing category will mainly include income and expenses from investments accounted for using the equity method as well as from cash and cash equivalents. those items are currently presented within our financial result and will be moved to the investing category. income and expenses that arise from transactions that involve only the raising of finance or items that arise from transactions that do not involve only the raising of finance but are identified by other ifrs will be classified in the financing category. this will mainly include items that are currently presented in our financial result e.g. interest expenses on convertible bonds and lease liabilities. items that do not fulfil these criteria shall be classified under other categories. for example income and expenses from hedging relationships shall be moved to the operating category. foreign exchange differences currently presented in financial result that relate to income and expenses for items that will be classified in the financing category will be presented in this category accordingly. however foreign exchange differences related to cash and cash equivalents will be presented in the investing category and foreign exchange differences related to trade receivables or trade payables will be classified in the operating category. the income taxes category will include only items currently presented under income taxes. lastly items required by ifrs  will be classified in the discontinued operations category which is not expected to be relevant for zalando.three new subtotals will be required. the operating profit or loss shall comprise all income and expenses classified in the operating category. the profit before financing and interest expenses will include all income and expenses classified in the operating or investing category. this is not equivalent to our ebit due to the items that will be moved from the financial result into the operating or investing category. additionally a profit or loss subtotal will be required which is equal to our net incomeloss for the period. there will be changes to the consolidated statement of cash flows due to amendments to ias . the starting point for the cash flow from operating activities using the indirect method will be the newly required operating profit or loss and not net incomeloss for the period. in addition interests paid and received that are currently only presented in the cash flow from operating activities will be classified as cash flow from financing activities interest paid or cash flow from investing activities interests and dividends received. with this change the free cash flow which is based on the cash flow from operating activities will be affected accordingly. furthermore there are new disclosure requirements. most relevant for zalando this requires information on expenses by nature if the function of expenses method is used as well as disclosures for managementdefined performance measures  that are companyspecific subtotals of income and expenses like ebit or adjusted ebit. zalando will apply ifrs  and related amendments of other standards for the annual reporting period beginning on  january . the standard will be applied retrospectively according to ias  which requires a reconciliation for each line item of the prior period presented in the annual report . we will also prepare our interim financial statements in financial year  in accordance with the new standard. expected impacts are based on reasonable information available before this annual report was authorised for issue. they may change due to new information available at a later date. january  early application permittedno application is not expected to have any material effect as none of our subsidiaries provide consolidated separate or

306,financial instruments classified as financial assets and financial liabilities are generally not netted they are only netted if the group has a legally enforceable right to set off and intends to settle the amounts on a net basis. financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or the financial asset and all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset have been substantially transferred. financial liabilities are derecognised when the contractual commitments have been discharged cancelled or have expired.the fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would have been received when selling an asset or paid when transferring a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. if there are listed prices on an active market e.g. share prices these are used as a measurement base. if there is no active market reference is made to the market most favourable to the entity for measurement purposes.the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition less any repayments and plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between the initial amount and the maturity amount and adjusted for loss allowance for financial assets.the amortised cost of current receivables and liabilities generally corresponds to the nominal value or settlement amount.financial assetsfinancial assets are classified as one of the following categories for the purpose of subsequent measurement amortised cost fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss.when financial assets are initially recognised they are measured at fair value except for trade receivables which zalando measures at the amount determined by applying ifrs  at initial recognition. for all categories except financial assets at fair value through profit or loss the transaction costs incurred are included in the initial recognition.the allocation to the aforementioned categories determines the subsequent measurement of financial assets. there are differing measurement rules for each category.financial assets measured at amortised cost are those which are held in a business model whose objective is to hold the financial asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and for which the contractual terms give rise on specific dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding sppi criterion. this measurement category is used for trade and other receivables other financial assets cash and cash equivalents and shortterm deposits.companycombined managementreport consolidated financialstatements other informationand service zalando se annual report,0.2605589433444479,,0.347767586336596,0.3197994467037174,0.3343683135885517,0.2989390237282658,0.4161667056020101,0.356919272838925,,0.2761842745510118,0.4789478802958866,0.3050503048555024,,0.3216611312842132,0.2970075872670261,,,0.1850684267271367,
307,the category of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income relates to financial assets that are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. on specified dates the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. the fluctuations in value recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to profit or loss at the time the asset is derecognised. impairment and foreign exchange gains or losses are nevertheless recognised in profit or loss. no financial assets were classified in this category in the financial year  or in the prior year.all other financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss. hence they are held within a business model whose objective is not to hold the financial asset to collect contractual cash flows or where cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. derivative financial instruments that are not effective hedging instruments  as well as corporate investments are allocated to this category. changes in the fair value of these financial assets are recognised through profit or loss.impairment of financial assetszalando recogni ses a loss allowance for expected credit losses for all financial assets other than those measured at fair value through profit or loss.  at each reporting date the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to a month expected credit loss general approach. if the credit risk has increased significantly the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit loss.for trade receivables zalando applies the simplified approach of ifrs  to measure the loss allowance at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit loss. zalando uses a scenariobased approach for this purpose and takes into account saleschannel and countryspecific allowance rates based on expected risks of default and how long the trade receivables are past due. trade receivables  typically resulting from the use of deferred payment methods e.g. pay by invoice  have due dates of a maximum of  to  days depending on the country in which the order is placed. for other receivables  resulting from the purchase of receivables due from customers of our partners for sales concluded on the  zalando platform   zalando applies the general approach of ifrs . because these receivables also have maximum due dates of  to  days the month expected credit loss is the same as the lifetime expected credit loss. therefore as for trade receivables zalando applies a scenariobased approach to determine expected credit losses for other receivables.receivables together with the allowance recognised are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows have expired. this is the case if there is no realistic prospect of future recovery and all collateral has been realised.companycombined managementreport consolidated financialstatements other informationand service zalando se annual report,0.2566043007557665,,0.3341708188681033,0.2922320614530431,0.337567733167636,0.3168407002058435,0.5030412425093443,0.366498236784829,0.2819877314423495,0.3071517353987354,0.4381389495815372,0.3248875888008674,0.2735224825278247,0.3741689425161144,0.2634777993379398,,,0.1817297156845142,0.3540458687564912
308,financial liabilitiesfinancial liabilities are recogni sed initially at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs in the case of loans and borrowings. zalando allocates financial liabilities to one of the following categories upon initial recognition fair value through profit or loss or amortised cost.financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as measured at fair value through profit or loss. in particular these include derivative financial instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments. gains and losses from the subsequent measurement are recognised through profit or loss.trade payables borrowings and other financial liabilities not held for trading are allocated to the category of financial liabilities measured at amortised cost and are thus measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method after initial recognition.compound financial instrumentsat issue of a nonderivative financial instrument zalando evaluates whether it contains both a liability and an equity component. for its convertible bonds zalando separately recognises financial liabilities reflected in the line item convertible bonds and equity instruments reflected in capital reserves. the liability component is initially measured at fair value using the interest and principal payments discounted with a riskadjusted interest rate of a comparable debt instrument without a conversion right. the equity component is initially measured at the residual value resulting from the deduction of the fair value of the liability component from the fair value of the compound instrument as a whole i.e. the fair value of the proceeds received. the liability component is subsequently measured at amortised cost. the equity component is not subsequently remeasured. incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of the compound instrument are allocated as transaction costs to the components pro rata on the basis of their initial fair values. hence the initial carrying amount of each component is measured at fair value less allocated transaction costs.derivative financial instruments and hedge accountingzalando uses derivative financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps exclusively to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations. such derivative financial instruments are initially recogni sed at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. derivative financial instruments are reported as financial assets if their fair value is positive. they are presented as financial liabilities in the statement of financial position if their fair value is negative.changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised either through profit or loss or other comprehensive income depending on whether the hedge accounting requirements of ifrs  are met.in general hedge accounting involves classifying derivative financial instruments either as an instrument to hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of a hedged item fair value companycombined managementreport consolidated financialstatements other informationand service zalando se annual report,0.2386158787055253,,,0.2966794557015056,,0.2979592217757706,0.4250208674664037,0.3412990622045918,0.2937110546385306,0.2876554442523514,0.4404278529207878,0.2890251967372042,,,0.2650719532736227,0.2518949455162779,,,0.2941216140763511
309,hedge an instrument to hedge forecast transactions cash flow hedge or an instrument to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation.as part of its risk management zalando has set out and documented objectives and strategies for mitigating risk when using hedges.a portion of the forward exchange contracts is used to hedge goods purchased in us dollars and pounds sterling and the resulting trade payables. another portion of the forward exchange contracts is used to hedge goods sold in foreign currency and the resulting trade receivables. these forward exchange contracts are concluded in pounds sterling swiss francs czech korunas norwegian kroner polish zlotys and swedish kronor.cash flow hedgesa cash flow hedge manages our exposure to fluctuations of future cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability in the case of interest risks to planned or highly probable forecast transactions and to fixed contractual obligations not shown on the face of the statement of financial position.if a cash flow hedge is effective the changes in the fair value of the hedge are recorded under other comprehensive income. changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the hedging instrument are posted directly as profit or loss in the other financial result for the period. the gains and losses resulting from hedges initially remain in other comprehensive income and are later included in the initial cost of a nonfinancial asset when the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of that nonfinancial asset inventory or is reclassified through profit or loss for the period in which the hedged transaction influences the net income for that period revenue.zalando uses forward exchange contracts as hedging instruments to hedge foreign currency risks resulting from contractual merchandise sourcing transactions that have yet to be fulfilled. in addition zalando uses forward exchange contracts to hedge planned revenue in foreign currency against exchange rate fluctuations. these are recognised as cash flow hedges if the conditions of hedge accounting are fulfilled. the amounts recognised as other comprehensive income are reclassified through inventories or profit or loss once the hedged items are realised. in the case of contractual merchandise sourcing transactions the amount of other comprehensive income is included in the initial cost of inventories. the share of other comprehensive income that is attributabl e to hed ged revenue is posted via revenue to profit or loss.fair value measurementthe group applies measurement techniques that are appropriate under the respective circumstances and for which sufficient data is available for fair value measurement. in the process observable market inputs are to be preferred to nonobservable inputs.assets and liabilities measured or presented at fair value in the financial statements are classified on the basis of the following fair value hierarchy. the classification uses the input parameters of the lowest category that is relevant to the fair value measurement.companycombined managementreport consolidated financialstatements other informationand service zalando se annual report,,,,,,,,,,,0.3441700564771701,,,,,,,,

311,the cumulative expense recognised for equitysettled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. the income or expense recognised in profit or loss for the period corresponds to the change in cumulative expenses recognised in the reporting period.no expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest due to a service or performance condition not being fulfilled. equitysettled payment models with marketrelated performance conditions and other nonvesting conditions affect the fair value of the granted options on the grant date only.when the terms of an equitysettled transaction are modified the minimum expense recognised is the expense that would have been incurred if the original terms of the arrangement had been fulfilled.zalando also recognises increases in the fair value of the equity instruments granted due to modifications.when an equitysettled award is cancelled it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation. any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. however if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award and designated as a replacement award on the grant date the new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award.revenue recognitionzalando generates revenue through our main business models in which we promise to transfer distinct goods or services to customers and partners retail business means that we buy inventory from brands and sell it to customers for our own account including goods sold via lounge by zalando or through our outlets. partner business enable brands and retailers to sell merchandise via zalando while maintaining full control over their offer content and pricing.  zalando partner marketing services zms serves as a holistic datadriven marketing service for fashion and lifestyle brands across many different channels offering impactful solutions along the entire marketing and sales channels and enabling our partners to connect their brand to around  million active customers at zalando and beyond. zalando ecommerce operating system zeos is our bb brand in which we are building an operating system for the fashion and lifestyle industry that will enable brands and retailers to manage their multichannel businesses across europe through one unified platform. this includes zeos fulfilment as our multichannel bb fulfilment solution as well as zalando fulfilment solutions zfs as a key addon service to our partner business which allows brand partners to leverage our european logistics network across our markets to increase customer reach convenience and customer satisfaction.companycombined managementreport consolidated financialstatements other informationand service zalando se annual report   retail business formerly known as wholesale and offprice business.  partner programme and connected retail.  zalando marketing services was rebranded to zalando partner marketing services to create a unified and consistent experience for partners to navigate through the various partner offerings.,,,,,,,0.4188559339765244,,0.2847655957114565,,,0.2680834760028027,,0.355732311166088,,,,,0.3031763062862091
312,revenue is recogni sed in accordance with the provisions of ifrs  when the goods or services promised are transferred to the customer. contractual performance obligations are typically satisfied when goods are handed over to the customer. revenue is measured at the amount of the consideration zalando expects to receive in exchange for transferring the promised goods and services. for our retail business we conclude that zalando is the principal in these revenue arrangements because we control the goods before transferring them to the customer. revenue is therefore recognised in full. however in the partner business we do not control the goods before transferring them to the customer. hence revenue is recognised in the amount of the commission that zalando as agent of these revenue arrangements expects to receive from the partner. in services zeos fulfilment and zms we render to partners zalando recognises all fees within revenue that we expect to receive from our partners for rendering those services. revenue is recorded net of sales deductions taxes and duties.zalando identifies its performance obligations as the distinct goods or services promised in a contract with a customer. apart from zalando plus the goods or services promised by zalando goods delivery and return with a return policy of up to  days and customer care express delivery or minimum order fee create a bundle that is distinct  i.e. the identified performance obligation . in contrast services promised to our partners partner business zeos fulfilment or zms are separately identifiable performance obligations.when selling merchandise to customers zalando transfers control over the promised goods and service s at a  specific po int in time. this is generally the case when the goods are delivered. for services rendered to our partners partner business zeos fulfilment or zms revenue is also recognised at the point in time the underlying performance obligations towards our partners are satisfied. in contrast performance obligations under zalando plus are standready obligations that are satisfied over time. therefore revenue is recognised on a straightline basis over the month subscription period.in assessing the consideration to be received zalando takes into account the right of return granted to the customers in the retail and the partner business.  revenue is not recognised unless sufficient evidence is available on the probability of the nonexercise of these rights based on past experience. the expected volume of returns is estimated based on saleschannel and countryspecific return rates and recognised as a reduction of revenue.zalando offers its customers a range of diverse payment options. depending on the payment option and the country in which the order is placed payments are typically due within a maximum of  to  days.companycombined managementreport consolidated financialstatements other informationand service zalando se annual report,,,,0.2927955801113079,,0.3009014476858618,0.5272014385381687,0.3860864154100568,0.3649896357808926,0.3145255892348428,0.3766424712483514,0.3497057589849053,,0.3980056864257836,0.2941453722030833,,0.1863138945419294,0.1734957147226932,0.3529731485411979
313,expected returnszalando presents the expected returns of goods on a gross basis in the income statement and reduces revenue by the full amount of sales that is estimated to be returned. cost of sales that are recorded in full upon delivery of the goods is then corrected by the estimated amount of returns.zalando also presents expected returns on a gross basis in the statement of financial position. in this context a right to recover goods from expected returns is recognised in other nonfinancial assets. the amount of the asset corresponds to the cost of the goods delivered for which returns are expected taking into account the costs incurred for processing the return and the expected losses resulting from disposal of these goods.trade receivables for which delivered goods are expected to be returned are also derecognised. for customer receivables already paid and for which returns are expected in the future zalando recognises a refund liability visvis the customer in other current financial liabilities.customer options for additional goods or servicesin  we evolved the zalando plus programme introducing a pointsbased system to reward customer loyalty. the new programme grants options to our customers for acquiring additional goods or services at a discount or for free in the form of level and countryspecific awards. these awards create a distinct bundle of goods or services and therefore a separate performance obligation that provides a material right to our customers.  we therefore also allocate a portion of the transaction price from the purchases that grant these awards to the future performance obligation. for this allocation we estimate the standalone selling price of the awards and take into account the award specific  discount the number of customers that participate in the programme the number of awards that have been granted as well as the award tierlevel and countryspecific likelihood of whether and when those awards will be redeemed.government grantsgovernment grants are recogni sed when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received since zalando complies with all the attached conditions. investment subsidies are deducted from the cost of the subsidised assets in the statement of financial position.government grants received for compensating costs are recognised through profit or loss and offset against the corresponding expense in the period when the entitlement arises.contingent liabilities and contingent assetscontingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence is dependent on future events that are not wholly under our control or present obligations for which it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or for which the amount of the obligation cannot be reliably measured.companycombined managementreport consolidated financialstatements other informationand service zalando se annual report,,,,0.2837267133205049,,,0.4044683973438847,0.3382665066432313,0.3323761987848248,,0.331697019159948,0.238374905419644,,0.3623611468947723,,,,0.1901616198672866,0.3334123233265839

359,.. other notes. risks relating to financial instruments and financial risk managementin the course of its ordinary activities zalando is exposed to credit risks liquidity risks and market risks mainly currency and interest rate risks. the aim of financial risk management is to limit the risks resulting from operating activities through the use of selected derivative and nonderivative hedging instruments. the derivative financial instruments are used in the group solely for the purpose of risk management. zalando would be exposed to higher financial risks if it did not use these instruments. the groups management is responsible for the manage ment of these risks.changes in exchange rates and interest rates can lead to considerable fluctuations in the market values of the derivatives used. these market value fluctuations should therefore not be considered in isolation from the hedged items as derivatives and hedged items form a unit in terms of their offsetting developments in value.market  riskmarket risk arises from changes in the fair value of future cash flows from financial instruments due to changes in market prices. market risks include interest rate  currency and other price risks.the currency risk can be broken down into two further types of risk translation risk and transaction risk. the translation risk describes the risk of changes in the items in the statement of financial position and income statement of a subsidiary due to exchange rate changes when translating the foreign local financial statements into the groups currency. the changes caused by currency fluctuations from the translation of items in the statement of financial position are presented in equity. zalando is exposed to translation risks from foreign subsidiaries in china hong kong poland sweden switzerland the united kingdom and the united states. currently zalando does not hedge the translation risk for these subsidiaries.transaction risks relates to the fact that exchange rate fluctuations can lead to changes in the value of future foreign currency payments. zalando operates in different markets and is therefore exposed to foreign currency risks generated from revenue and sourcing transactions in foreign currencies. forward exchange contracts are used to hedge these activities. for this purpose plain vanilla otc derivative financial instruments are concluded and processed in accordance with internal guidelines that set out binding rules for the scope of action and responsibilities as well as reporting and controls. risk exposure is hedged using a standard layered approach. the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument is determined prospectively through a critical terms match based on currency tenor and notional  amount.  the hedge ratio is established through internal approval processes and calculated based on outstanding notional volume of foreign exchange forwards in relation to the notional volume of the underlying highly probable forecasted transactions. as of the reporting date the average monthly hedge ratio for  ranged between . and . prior year between . and . depending on the currency. sources of hedge ineffectiveness can be changes in the forecasted highly probable underlying business transactions. companycombined managementreport consolidated financialstatements other informationand service zalando se annual report,,,,,,,,,,,0.3922190451912848,,,,,,,,
362,zalando is currently not exposed to any material interest rate risks that might arise from interest rate fluctuations on earnings equity or cash flow for the current or future reporting period. credit riskcredit risk is the risk of a customer or contractual partner defaulting on payment resulting in the assets financial assets or receivables reported in the consolidated statement of financial position having to be written down. credit risks primarily concern trade and other receivables. the credit risk is provided for by portfoliobased valuation allowances based on historical experience and the maturity profile. uncollectable receivables are written off in full individually. the i nterest levels  though currently falling but still remaining relatively high are generally putting pressure  on payment providers especially through the buy nowpay later concept. this means that the credit default risk of individual customers is stills putting pressure on zalando.there is no significant concentration of credit risk.for cash and cash equivalents there is an additional credit risk that banks can no longer meet their obligations. the maximum exposure corresponds to the carrying amounts of these financial assets at the end of the respective reporting period. the company addresses this exposure by distributing its derivative financial instruments and cash held at banks over multiple financial institutions with good credit standing and over money market funds with a aaa rating according to standard  poors.liquidity riskthe liquidity risk is defined as a possible lack of cash funds to fulfil  the financial obligations of the company. this hazard may arise from the insufficient centralisation of cash where it is needed inexact liquidity forecasting or an unbalanced investment strategy for the companys cash reserves.zalando manages its exposure to liquidity risk by regularly monitoring liquidity needs through an integrated platform for the short medium and longterm forecasting of cash requirements.additionally the group invests the cash reserves of the company in term deposits and money market instruments and pools the cash balances centrally on a regular basis to ensure cash is located where it is needed.to further reduce the liquidity risk zalando uses reverse factoring as an additional financing source to extend the payment terms with different financial partners and suppliers in order to improve working capital. under these agreements the factor purchases the claims held by the respective supplier against zalando. these are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position under trade payables and similar liabilities.there is no significant concentration of liquidity risk.companycombined managementreport consolidated financialstatements other informationand service zalando se annual report,,,,,,,,,,,0.3991143116865862,0.2360659648658727,,,,,,,

379,our audit approach based on our understanding of the process we assessed the design and implementation of identified internal controls relating to the determination of the expected net realisable value. in doing so we analysed the determination of the costs necessary to make the sale allocated to the sales and the loss rates observed in the past for the respective distribution and utilisation channels.furthermore we examined the acquisition costs for a randomly selected sample and the season allocation of goods for a randomly selected sample.in addition we assessed the companys analyses of the seasonality of fashion and constantly changing trends and based on the companys historical experience evaluated whether the discounts recorded were appropriate. we assessed these historical empirical values on the basis of the analyses of sales results prepared by the company. we assessed the specific valuation allowances recognised for outlet goods on the basis of comparable sales transactions in the  financial year.finally we set expected values for the required valuation allowances on the basis of the aforementioned calculation methods and compared these with the companys calculations.our observations the assumptions used to determine the value adjustments for inventories goods and the judgement exercised by the legal representatives are appropriate. existence and accuracy of revenue from the sale of goodsplease refer to sections .. subsection revenue and .. subsection revenue recognition of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on the accounting policies applied and the assumptions made.the financial statement riskin the consolidated statement of comprehensive income zalando se recognises revenue from the sale of goods of eur  million. this revenue accounts for around  of the groups total revenue. revenue from the sale of merchandise has a significant impact on the groups earnings figures and is one of the most important performance indicators for the group.zalando se recognises revenue from the sale of goods when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised asset to a customer. an asset is considered transferred when the customer obtains control of the asset. in the context of the sale of goods using the zalando online shop this is the point in time when the goods are delivered to the customer.customers of zalando se have the option of returning goods free of charge within the statutory cancellation periods as well as within the return periods granted by zalando. the expected returns not to be recognised as revenue are calculated by the legal representatives. this calculation is based on methods data and assumptions in particular regarding expected return rates.companycombined managementreport consolidated financialstatements other informationand service zalando se annual report,,,,,,,0.4965424753387563,,,,,,,,,,,0.1694356393133782,
